Can masks reduce corona infections when worn by a large proportion of the population?,"['Studies show slow spread After three years of pandemic, there are now relatively meaningful data that masks can slow down the spread of the Corona virus.', 'Surgical masks, in turn, seem to reduce the risk of infecting themselves with the corona virus.']",0,"The first sentence provides evidence that masks can slow down the spread of the Corona virus, supporting the claim that masks can reduce corona infections when worn by a large proportion of the population.","International studies suggest that the number of corona infections decreases when many people wear masks - whether fabric, surgical or FFP2 masks. However, it is not possible to precisely quantify how great the protective effect actually is. It probably depends on the type of masks and the proportion of people who wear them."
Can homeopathic preparations with Anamirta cocculus help against dizziness?,"['But without success: We could not find any meaningful scientific evidence for effectiveness in dizziness.', 'It is now well proven by studies that homeopathic preparations usually do not work better than a sham medication (placebo) [8].', 'However, it is not well established that betahistine is effective against dizziness [11.13].', 'The fact that betahist helps with dizziness is not well documented [11, 13].']",1,"The claim of homeopathic preparations with Anamirta cocculus helping against dizziness is not supported as there is no meaningful scientific evidence of their effectiveness, and they typically do not work better than a placebo.","We have found only one study that has investigated this. However, it is so poor that no reliable statement is possible."
Can zeolite alleviate or prevent health problems?,"['However, none of these can provide any evidence – because the studies have no significance (for reasons see section Studies in detail ).', 'It does not find an advantage for zeolite – but the results are hardly meaningful.', 'However, it is not researched whether the regular intake of zeolite can lead to a nutrient deficiency or has an undesirable effect on digestion.']",1,"The claim that zeolite can alleviate or prevent health problems is not supported by the provided sentences, as there is no significant evidence found in studies and no research on potential nutrient deficiencies or digestive effects due to regular zeolite intake.",Studies to date cannot provide any evidence that taking zeolite prevents or alleviates complaints. A detoxifying effect is not scientifically plausible.
Does paxlovid protect unvaccinated people with risk factors from severe or even fatal covid 19 disease?,"['Patients at risk without corona vaccination appear to be well protected from serious to fatal events by Paxlovid.', 'However, it is not certain how well Paxlovid helps people who have already received corona vaccination.', 'In addition, the scientists investigated whether Paxlovid alleviated the Covid-19 symptoms, shortened the duration of the disease and reduced the need for medical treatment: Half of the participants improved the symptoms with Paxlovid after 13 days, with placebo after 15 days.', 'With Paxlovid, 14 out of 1000 participants needed medical treatment for Covid-19 within a month, with placebo 76 out of 1000.', 'Whether with or without antibodies in the blood, Paxlovid basically protected all humans from a severe course.']",0,"While the sentences suggest that Paxlovid offers protection from severe or fatal Covid-19 for those with or without antibodies, they do not explicitly state whether this protection applies only to unvaccinated individuals with risk factors, leaving uncertainty regarding the claim.","In a large, well-done study, paxlovid prevented hospitalizations and deaths in high-risk patients. They were unvaccinated and had contracted the delta variant. For vaccinated people, the benefit cannot be reliably estimated. This also applies to people with immunodeficiency."
"Does starting school later improve health, learning success, and quality of life in adolescents?","['However, teenagers and parents now have to be very strong: despite 27 studies involving hundreds of thousands of students, no clear results can be derived from research.', 'The problem: The studies usually come to contradictory results.', 'So until better research results are available, all troubled young people and parents will only have the option of remaining out of bed early – or to hope that, despite lack of evidence, the school management will still have an insight into it.', 'It is difficult to examine whether a later start to school will have a positive effect.', 'The Problems: Unknown Influencing Factors: If differences occur in previous-after-studies, these do not have to be due to the later start of school – they may also have been caused by other changes over the course of the study period.']",1,The claim cannot be definitively supported or refuted due to contradictory results from existing studies and the presence of unknown influencing factors.,"The question has been investigated in several large studies. Due to methodological deficiencies and contradictory results, no firm conclusions can be drawn. This means that science can currently neither speak for nor against a benefit of a later school start."
Does the F.X. Mayr cure have health benefits? Can it prevent diseases or treat them?,"['Thus, the claim that the method can help with various diseases is not scientifically justified.', 'These studies cannot answer whether these changes also affect health.', 'Mayr cure or other fasting methods improve health in the long term, however, cannot be concluded.']",1,"The provided sentences offer no scientific evidence to support the claim that the F.X. Mayr cure has health benefits, prevents diseases, or treats them, and they suggest that the long-term health effects of fasting methods like the Mayr cure are inconclusive.","It is neither examined nor proven whether the special fasting method after F.X. Mayr holds, which it promises: Namely assistance with all possible illnesses of allergies, over rheumatism up to sleep disturbances. The advertised detoxification and ""purification"" of the body by the chamfering cure are besides scientifically not plausible."
Does the consumption of soy foods or soy isoflavones affect the appearance of acne skin?,"['In both cases, certain soya ingredients are responsible for the effect on the skin: the isoflavones.', 'There are two competing theories that contradict each other: according to the first theory, isoflavones confuse the hormone balance and are supposed to promote acne in this way.', 'Surprisingly, despite searching in two large databases, we could not find a study on soy products and acne – whether soy milk, soy sauce or tofu.', 'The isoflavones improved the skin appearance more than an anti-acne cream with vitamin A acid (Tretinoin).', 'Conclusion: There is currently no evidence from reliable studies that soy makes acne worse.']",1,"While there are theories suggesting isoflavones in soy products can disrupt hormone balance and potentially promote acne, a thorough search of two large databases revealed no studies directly examining the relationship between soy and acne, making it difficult to definitively support or refute the claim.","We could not find any meaningful studies at all on the influence of soy foods on acne. On soy isoflavones, we found two small studies of questionable quality that examined a very specific group of sufferers. Soy isoflavones improved the skin appearance somewhat. However, this result is not reliable."
Does extract from the Damiana plant (Turnera diffusa) help with erectile dysfunction?,"['Efficacy does not appear to have been studied or demonstrated.', 'The studies in detail We could not find any studies on Damiana extract against erectile dysfunction in men.', 'Studies on the product Neradin also appear to be missing.']",1,"The claim cannot be supported since there are no studies demonstrating the efficacy of Damiana extract for erectile dysfunction in men, and studies on the related product Neradin are also missing.","The extract from the Damiana plant (Turnera diffusa) is advertised as a remedy for erectile dysfunction for men. However, this claimed effect on potency is by no means proven. It has apparently never been tested on humans. This also applies to homeopathic remedies such as the product Neradin."
Is the homeopathic remedy Neradin effective for erectile dysfunction?,"['No studies on Neradin Also our search for studies on the product Neradin remained resultless.', 'Studies on the product Neradin also appear to be missing.']",1,"The claim cannot be supported because no studies on the effectiveness of Neradin for erectile dysfunction were found, and its impact remains unproven by available research.","The extract from the Damiana plant (Turnera diffusa) is advertised as a remedy for erectile dysfunction for men. However, this claimed effect on potency is by no means proven. It has apparently never been tested on humans. This also applies to homeopathic remedies such as the product Neradin."
Does regular HPV testing in addition to the recommended Pap smear detect more precancerous lesions than just the Pap smear alone?,"['According to the studies, the HPV test is likely to detect slightly more precursors of cervical cancer over several years than the PAP swab alone.', 'We are therefore relatively sure that with an additional HPV test at least a little more precursors of uterine cancer are detected than only with the PAP swab alone.']",0,"The studies indicate that HPV testing detects marginally more precancerous cervical lesions over time compared to Pap smears alone, providing evidence for the claim.","Regular examination of the cervix by means of PAP smear tests detects precancerous stages of the cervix in most cases in good time. This reduces the risk of developing cervical cancer. An additional HPV test every three to five years can make screening even more reliable. However, the difference should not be too great."
Can monk's pepper reduce PMS symptoms? PMS is the abbreviation for premenstrual syndrome. This refers to complaints that occur in the days before menstruation.,"['Reference to efficacy in PMS According to previous studies, monk peppers could actually help in PMS.', 'The summarized study results indicate that the symptoms with monk pepper are reduced in more patients than with a sham medication (placebo).', 'Therefore, it would be possible for monk peppers to act against PMS symptoms such as breast spacing.']",0,"The summarized results of previous studies suggest that monk pepper may reduce PMS symptoms more effectively than a placebo, providing support for the claim.","In the studies to date, monk's pepper seems to relieve PMS symptoms better than a placebo. However, this is not well proven, because the studies have significant weaknesses. There is no evidence of an effect on menstrual disorders. Significant studies are lacking."
Can olive leaf extract reduce high blood pressure?,"['These studies therefore do not indicate whether olive leaf extract can help with significantly increased blood pressure.', 'Without success, however, we could not find any studies that investigated the effect of olive leaf extract on cardiovascular health.', 'However, they cannot provide clear answers.', 'It is therefore impossible to say whether olive leaves extract could have a better or worse effect with significantly increased blood pressure.']",1,"The studies referenced do not provide clear evidence indicating whether olive leaf extract can help reduce high blood pressure, as no studies investigating its effect on cardiovascular health were found to be successful.","Whether olive leaf extract lowers blood pressure has been investigated in five suitable studies to date. They all found no effect or only a slight effect of the extract. The problem with this is that most of the study participants had only slightly elevated blood pressure. They cannot answer how olive leaf extract works in people with significantly elevated blood pressure (hypertension). The studies also had gross flaws, few participants, and ran for a very short time. They cannot provide reliable answers."
Do green-lipped mussel preparations improve the symptoms of osteoarthritis?,"['Studies overall not meaningful The conclusion of our research: Scientific evidence for the claimed effect is missing.', 'It is also unclear whether the measured positive effects are large enough to actually be felt by those affected.', 'Whether or not green-lipped mussel helps with osteoarthritis cannot be said at the moment.', 'However, as early as 2009, the European Food Safety Authority considered that a protective effect of the green-lipped mussel on healthy joints has not been established.', 'In our opinion, no reliable conclusions can be drawn from the studies found.']",1,"The claim that green-lipped mussel preparations improve the symptoms of osteoarthritis is not supported by the research, which finds no scientific evidence for the claimed effect and considers the measured positive effects too small to be perceptible by those affected.","The question was examined in four small studies with serious methodological deficiencies, which also arrived at partly contradictory results. No clear conclusions can be drawn from them. The claim that green-lipped mussel helps with osteoarthritis is not scientifically proven."
Can the so-called Tupler technique help against rectus diastasis?,"['No studies on the Tupler technique As intense as we were looking for, we could not find the promised studies on the Tupler technique.', 'The claim that this is a scientifically proven therapy for rectus diastase is therefore simply wrong.', 'The studies in detail We did not find any studies that investigated the effectiveness of the Tupler technique for the treatment of rectus diastase.']",1,"The claim that the Tupler technique is a scientifically proven therapy for rectus diastasis is incorrect, as no studies investigating its effectiveness for this condition were found.",We could not find a single study that examined whether the Tupler technique actually works. And this despite the fact that providers of the method advertise that its effectiveness is scientifically proven.
Can CBD (cannabidiol) help with migraines or other headaches?,"['Apparently, CBD has never been investigated to see if it can help with migraine seizures.', 'The claim that CBD would help with migraines or headaches is pure speculation.', 'The studies in detail Despite extensive search in three databases, we could not find any studies on CBD against migraine or other types of headache, neither for treatment nor for prevention.']",1,"While there are no studies found on CBD's effectiveness against migraines or other headaches, the claim of its helpfulness remains speculative.",There are no studies that have investigated the effectiveness of CBD against migraine. So claims that CBD can help with or prevent migraine attacks have no scientific basis. The same is true for other types of headache.
Can laser irradiation of blood by infusion needle (hemolaser treatment) relieve discomfort or help with diseases?,"['It is also unclear by what mechanism blood irradiation with bundled red light – i.e.', 'red laser – should improve health.', 'Although the authors of the three studies found [1-3] claim to have established a clear efficacy of haemolaser treatment, none of the three studies is suitable to prove this.']",1,"The three studies on hemolaser treatment lack the necessary rigor to establish its claimed efficacy in improving health, and the mechanism by which red laser irradiation of blood improves health remains unclear.",There is no scientific evidence that hemolaser treatment has a palliative or curative effect on health problems.
"In everyday life, when breathing with an FFP2 mask or ordinary mouth-nose protection, do you get as much oxygen as without a mask?","['As much oxygen as without a mask This fear is, however, unfounded, as previously conducted studies show [ 1,2 ].', 'Only in very strenuous sports (fast cycling to exhaustion) was the oxygen content in the blood with FFP2 mask slightly lower than without mask.', 'There was no difference in oxygen measurement with ordinary oral nose protection.', 'Breathing a little more strenuous The results thus contradict the rumor that masks would cause an oxygen deficiency.']",0,"The claim is supported by the sentences provided, as previous studies indicate no significant difference in oxygen intake when wearing an FFP2 mask or ordinary mouth-nose protection in everyday life, except for very strenuous sports with the FFP2 mask.","Even if breathing with a mask can feel uncomfortable: According to studies to date, you get just as much oxygen with an FFP2 mask or mouth-nose protection as without a mask. This is true even when you are moving or exerting yourself. Only very intensive sports slightly reduce the oxygen content in the blood - but too little to endanger health."
Can CBD help with period pain?,"['Because despite searching in three different databases we could not find a single study on CBD in case of regular pain.', 'Scientifically, it is not sufficiently researched whether CBD actually promotes sleep, as providers claim.', 'The studies in detail We could not find any studies that investigated whether CBD can help with normal pain – neither for treatment nor for prevention.']",1,"The sentences provide no evidence specifically regarding CBD's effect on period pain, as no studies were found to support this claim.",Whether CBD can relieve menstrual pain has apparently never been scientifically studied. We could not find any studies on this. Women who suffer from severe period pain should talk to a gynecologist about it. Diseases such as endometriosis could be behind it.
Does arthroscopy (joint endoscopy) help with osteoarthritis of the knee joint?,"['What might sound logical, however, has a catch: the arthroscopy of osteoarthritis does nothing to the treated person.', 'Studies clearly speak against a benefit A research team summarized the most meaningful of all previously published studies on arthroscopy in knee arthritis.', 'In these studies, patients treated after arthroscopy had no noticeably less pain or movement restrictions than those treated only for appearance or not at all.', 'Arthroscopy against osteoarthritis: not effective, but also not very risky After all: Undesirable events were not conspicuously common in the arthroscopy groups either.']",2,"The claim that arthroscopy helps with osteoarthritis of the knee joint is refuted by several studies indicating no significant reduction in pain or movement restrictions for patients who undergo the procedure, compared to those who receive no treatment or placebo treatment.",The data are clear: Arthroscopy is useless as a treatment for knee osteoarthritis. It can neither relieve pain nor improve the function of the knee joint in the long term.
"Do dietary supplements containing silicon (e.g. as ""organic silicon"" or silica) have health benefits?","['So far it is also completely unclear what role the element silicon plays in the human body at all [8].', 'We have researched: Previous studies do not provide any evidence that dietary supplements with silicon support bone build-up and thus protect older women from osteoporosis and bone fractures in old age [1,2].', 'There is no evidence that silicon improves the hair structure [3,4], strengthens the fingernails [4] or makes the skin more beautiful and elastic [4,6,7].', 'Also that silicon supports the formation of collagen and connective tissue is only a conjecture [8].', 'Conjectures without studies Neither we nor the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) [8] were able to find clinical studies on any other alleged health benefits of silicon.']",1,"The role of silicon in the human body is unclear, and no studies provide evidence that dietary supplements with silicon support bone build-up, improve hair structure, strengthen fingernails, make the skin more beautiful, or support collagen and connective tissue formation.","There is no evidence so far that the additional intake of silicon can promote health. Also that it strengthens nails, skin and hair is an unsubstantiated claim. Moreover, it is unclear whether silicon plays any role at all in the body."
Can regular intake of cranberry juice or cranberry extract prevent recurrent cystitis in women?,"['The summarized results show that the regular intake of cranberry products could have a preventive effect.', 'There is also only evidence that cranberry products can prevent bladder inflammation for otherwise healthy women.', 'Overall, there is evidence of a possible preventive effect of cranberry.']",0,"The summarized results indicate that cranberry products may prevent bladder inflammation for generally healthy women, but the evidence does not clearly support a preventive effect against recurrent cystitis in all women.","Women who repeatedly have to deal with bladder infections might become ill somewhat less frequently if they regularly take cranberry juice or extract.

"Does microimmunotherapy improve symptoms of allergies, cancer, joint inflammation, autoimmune diseases, dementia or various viral infections?","['None of these studies are meaningful – because they are poorly carried out and the published data are incomplete.', 'They cannot give any indication of the benefits of microimmune therapy.', 'Entitled doubts Since microimmune therapy preparations are highly diluted as homeopathic agents, we have fundamental doubts about the method.']",1,"The claim cannot be supported as the provided sentences express doubts about the method of microimmunotherapy due to its high dilution, similar to homeopathic agents, and question the validity of studies due to incomplete data and poor execution.","So far, studies seem to exist only on microimmunotherapy against hay fever and cancer. Their significance is far too low to conclude that the therapy is effective. We found no studies on other health problems. Thus, there is no proven benefit of microimmunotherapy for any disease."
Can ginkgo extract improve mental performance in dementia patients?,"['Dementia patients taking Ginkgo extract often seemed to perform better in thinking, memory, and concentration tasks than those who swallowed placebo preparations without an active substance [1.3].', 'Although the studies indicate that Ginkgo extract can help people with dementia, the significance of the individual studies is limited.']",0,"While some studies suggest Ginkgo extract may help dementia patients with thinking, memory, and concentration tasks, the significance of individual studies is limited.",Previous studies suggest that ginkgo extract can improve mental performance in dementia - but this is not well established.

This has not yet been scientifically investigated. We also could not find a single study on vitamin C and fatigue occurring in the context of Long Covid.
Does taking probiotics shorten the duration of acute infectious diarrhea?,"['Thus, at least in children, taking live probiotics is unlikely to affect whether they are still ill after 48 hours.', 'Thus, a probiotic apparently has no clear influence on the resolution of the disease.']",2,"The sentences indicate that probiotics do not have a clear influence on resolving acute infectious diarrhea, which contradicts the claim that probiotics can shorten its duration.","According to current studies, the duration of disease cannot be reduced by taking probiotics.

Does the Orthopulse device accelerate the orthodontic correction of malocclusions?,"['Little meaningful The three published studies [1-3] cannot convince: None of the studies actually investigates the entire duration of treatment, but only the speed of tooth movements in the correction phase of brace therapy.', 'This does not make any sure statements about the reduction of the overall duration of treatment with which the manufacturer advertises.', 'Theoretically, two effects of orthopulses would be conceivable: positive effects if the duration of treatment were shortened, or negative effects if conversion processes at the tooth root were accelerated.', 'Thus, it is also questionable whether the faster treatment with the orthopulse device actually results from infrared therapy: In the control group, the teeth move on average by 0.44 mm per week, in the group with the orthopulse device on average by 1.27 mm per week.']",1,"The studies on the Orthopulse device only investigate the speed of tooth movements during brace therapy, not the entire duration of treatment, providing insufficient evidence to confirm the manufacturer's claim of reduced overall treatment time.",Poorly done studies show that the device can accelerate tooth movement in the short term. Whether this reduces the overall treatment time has not yet been sufficiently proven. The methodological weaknesses of the studies also mean that the results are not very credible. Possible side effects have not yet been sufficiently investigated.
Is it harmful for the mental development of the unborn child if the mother regularly eats fish contaminated with mercury during pregnancy?,"['For previous studies suggest that the consumption of larger amounts of mercury-containing fish could slightly affect the mental performance of the offspring [1, 2, 3].', 'The studies in detail The fact that methyl mercury can damage the brain of unborn children already in concentrations in which the pregnant mothers themselves do not notice any symptoms is beyond question [6].', 'In investigations into the Faroe Islands and New Zealand, the assumption was confirmed: expectant mothers with high mercury levels were given children, whose mental performance was on average slightly worse in later tests than that of unloaded mothers – the mercury levels of the mothers were mostly so high, because they had consumed large amounts of contaminated fish before and during pregnancy.', 'Impact on the IQ Despite these contradictions, the consumption of contaminated fish seems to reduce the intelligence of the offspring measurable, although it is not yet clear how much.', ""A research team at Harvard University calculated an average reduction in the intelligence ratio of 0.7 points for each micrograms of mercury in mother's hair [2] in the analysis of studies from the Faroe Islands, Seychelles and New Zealand.""]",0,"The claim is supported by studies suggesting a slight decrease in mental performance of the offspring when the mother consumes large amounts of mercury-contaminated fish during pregnancy, with measurable reductions in IQ observed.","Many commercially available types of edible fish are contaminated with traces of methyl mercury. There are indications that regular consumption of such mercury-containing fish during pregnancy can impair the brain development of unborn children and thus their later mental abilities. In contrast, consumption of fish low in mercury could promote brain development in the unborn."
Can the consumption of caffeine during pregnancy harm the unborn child?,"['However, the study showed that it made no difference whether the participants drank around three cups of caffeine or decaffeinated coffee.', ""On average, the weight of birth at birth was about the same, was similar in size and was not more frequently born too early even after the mother's caffeine consumption."", 'Similar to the summary of the Cochrane overview work: In early pregnancy three cups of coffee daily would have no effect on birth weight, growth or premature birth [2].']",1,"The study's findings indicate that caffeine consumption during pregnancy, equivalent to around three cups of coffee, does not negatively impact birth weight, size, or gestational age at birth.",There is insufficient evidence that moderate consumption of caffeinated beverages would have a negative impact on the child's development. Up to three cups of coffee a day does not appear to reduce the child's birth weight. Very large amounts of caffeine-containing beverages could possibly contribute to lower birth weight.
Are vegetables prepared in a microwave oven less healthy than those prepared in other ways?,"['Recent studies see the matter more differentiated: Depending on the variety of vegetables and the exact type of preparation, the microwave can sometimes be better and sometimes worse suited than, for example, cooking [2-12].', 'In the worst case, if it is exaggerated with the duration and the number of watts, the corresponding food is less health-promoting, but in no way harmful to health.', 'If there are health problems related to the microwave, then this is not because the microwave ingredients are destroyed or changed, but because it is simply too unhealthy to eat altogether.', 'The week-long feeding with always several times warmed up in the microwave has not led to any signs of poisoning in the animals.']",2,"While some studies suggest that microwave preparation of vegetables can be better or worse than other methods depending on the type and duration, there is no evidence indicating that microwaved vegetables become harmful to health or that health issues related to microwaves stem from ingredient destruction.","How vegetables change during preparation is extremely variable. With any type of heating, ingredients can be lost or become more easily accessible. In sum, it cannot be said that preparation in the microwave is always a bad choice."
Can garlic extract reduce high blood pressure and thus the risk of cardiovascular disease?,"['Two better performed randomised-controlled studies provide cautious evidence that garlic can lower too high blood pressure [1].', 'However, even the results of these two studies are insufficiently valid for a clear assessment [1].', 'Whether garlic taken regularly can lower too high blood pressure and thus lower the risk of cardiovascular disease remains unclear for the time being.', 'At least in theory, there may also be interactions with anticoagulant drugs or side effects in persons with a tendency to bleed, as garlic is suspected to have an anticoagulant effect.']",1,"While two studies suggest garlic can lower high blood pressure, their validity is questioned, leaving it unclear if garlic can reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and potential interactions with anticoagulant drugs or side effects in individuals prone to bleeding.","Studies to date provide tentative evidence of a blood pressure-lowering effect of garlic. However, they are of too low quality to be able to prove a reduction in the risk of cardiovascular disease as a result of high blood pressure."
Can fructose damage the liver?,"['Fruit sugar as a cause not proven There are no meaningful indications for the assumption that fruit sugar is responsible for the development of the liver disease [1].', 'In other words, for the liver, it may not matter what kind of sugar you eat.']",1,"The claim that fructose can damage the liver is not supported by the provided sentences, which indicate that there is no substantial evidence linking fruit sugar to liver disease development, and the type of sugar consumed may not significantly affect the liver.",There is no conclusive evidence for a possible liver-damaging effect of fructose.
Can green tea affect the likelihood of dying early and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease?,"['In fact, the summarized results of observational studies show that passionate green tea drinkers live longer on average – apparently because they are less likely to die from cardiovascular diseases such as heart attack [2,3].', ""However, a 100% proven cause-effect relationship à la ‘Green tea use protects against stroke, heart attack and co' cannot be derived from these observational studies."", 'We do not know exactly what the substances from the green tea in our body do – and what amounts can trigger a positive health effect.', 'Overall, the study data show that passionate green tea drinkers are less likely to die from cardiovascular diseases and thus live longer overall.', 'Seven RCTs are summarized here, and the authors concluded that green tea as a beverage or dietary supplement may have a beneficial influence on the risk factors of blood pressure, total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol.']",0,"The claim is partially supported by observational studies indicating a correlation between green tea consumption and reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, which may contribute to longer lifespans, but the exact cause-effect relationship and active substances are not fully understood.","There is a lack of conclusive studies on the health effects of specific matcha. However, there is some evidence that green tea in general may reduce the likelihood of dying prematurely, especially from cardiovascular disease."
Is matcha tea particularly healthy?,"['No recommendations, no warnings Due to the current study situation, it is therefore not possible to make specific recommendations for tea consumption.', 'The studies in detail Matcha is the trend for many consumers, but in scientific literature this special green tea hardly exists.']",1,"The scientific literature on matcha, a popular type of green tea, is limited, making it difficult to make specific health recommendations regarding its consumption.","There is a lack of conclusive studies on the health effects of specific matcha.

Can acupuncture prevent migraines and tension headaches?,"['Acupuncture works... From chronic migraines or tension headaches Affected patients get significantly rare headache attacks when they not only take conventional medication, but also undergo prophylactic acupuncture treatment.', '...but as good as migraine medications Another point suggests that acupuncture has a valuable prophylactic effect – at least for migraine sufferers: Further studies showed that acupuncture can only partially prevent migraine attacks, but at least as well as common medications [1].']",0,"While some studies suggest acupuncture can reduce the frequency of migraine attacks at least as well as conventional medications, it only has a partial preventive effect.","In the case of migraine, the preventive effect of acupuncture is probably similar to that of prophylactic medication. However, for both migraine and tension headaches, acupuncture performs only slightly better than sham acupuncture. Whether the pricking of traditional acupuncture points plays a role is unclear."
Can green tea reduce the likelihood of dying from cancer ?,"['In some studies, there was indeed a slightly reduced probability of disease, but other studies even suggested an increased risk of cancer from the use of green tea.', 'The result provides sobering clarity: people who regularly drink large amounts of green tea die in sum as often at some kind of cancer as people who hardly touch green tea [8].', 'To a degree harmless Although the benefits of green tea against cancer are questionable, there is no evidence of a health-impairing effect in moderate consumption of some cups a day [2].']",2,"While some studies suggest a slight reduction in disease probability with green tea consumption, others indicate an increased cancer risk, and overall, regular drinkers of large amounts of green tea die from cancer at similar rates as those who rarely drink it, providing no clear evidence of reduced likelihood of dying from cancer due to green tea consumption.",The results of previous studies suggest that green tea cannot reduce the risk of dying from cancer.
Can plant sterols or foods with them reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease?,"['However, it is unclear whether the intake of such high amounts of plant sterols – e.g.', 'Whether these results are a coincidence or whether the higher rate of cardiovascular problems are actually due to plant sterols and not to other causes is unclear.', 'Cholesterol is also different Whether plant sterols can actually reduce not only LDL cholesterol levels, but also the risk of cardiovascular diseases, has not been investigated in a single clinical study.']",1,"While studies show that plant sterols can lower LDL cholesterol levels, there is no clinical study demonstrating that they reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases specifically.","Plant sterols do lower cholesterol levels. However, whether they also reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease has not been researched. Animal studies even provide evidence that plant sterols in large quantities could increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. Whether this also applies to humans has not been investigated."
Can too much iodine cause autoimmune thyroid disease and consequently hypothyroidism?,"['Individual studies suggest that too large amounts of iodine may be responsible.', 'Probably a variety of causes These study results suggest that Hashimoto disease is more likely to occur in people with particularly high iodine consumption.', 'However, large amounts of iodine may cause serious disturbances in people with potentially undetected thyroid problems [8].', 'The studies in detail Whether large amounts of iodine can actually cause inflammation of the thyroid gland by an overreacting immune system is not well protected.', 'The result: the higher the iodine intake in a region, the greater the proportion of residents who suffer from autoimmune thyroid inflammation.']",0,"The claim is partially supported by individual studies suggesting a link between high iodine consumption and Hashimoto's disease, but the evidence is not conclusive on iodine directly causing inflammation of the thyroid gland or hypothyroidism.",Autoimmune thyroid disease appears to occur more frequently in individuals with high iodine consumption. Whether high levels of iodine actually cause this disease has not been conclusively determined.
Is the sweetener aspartame harmful to health?,"['The result: the sweetener is in all probability safe.', 'Safety levels Based on the results of numerous studies in laboratory animals and humans, the scientists established a safety limit for aspartame.', 'Thus, every person can take 40 milligrams per kilogram of body weight every day for the rest of his life without fear of health consequences.', 'Even those who exceed this amount will not suffer any health hazard.']",2,"Based on numerous studies in laboratory animals and humans, scientists have established a safety limit for aspartame, indicating that it is unlikely to be harmful to health when consumed within the recommended daily limit.","Health damage from aspartame is unlikely. This also applies to people who consume aspartame-sweetened foods and beverages in large quantities over a long period of time. However, in people suffering from the hereditary disease phenylketonuria (PKU), aspartame can cause nerve and brain damage."
Does coffee affect cancer death risk?,"['Both studies concluded that coffee consumption has no effect on cancer mortality.', 'In other words, coffee generally does not seem to favor or prevent death through cancer.', 'For breast cancer, prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer and bladder cancer there seems to be no association with the consumption of coffee.', 'Conclusion: Coffee consumption does not seem to affect cancer mortality.', 'They did not detect any influence of coffee on the number of cancer deaths.']",2,"The studies consistently show no association between coffee consumption and a reduced or increased risk of cancer mortality, including specific types such as breast, prostate, pancreatic, and bladder cancer.",Current evidence suggests that coffee consumption in general is neither protective nor detrimental to cancer death risk.
Can increased water consumption prevent migraines or other headaches?,"['Preventive effect of water unclear In 2011, Dutch researchers published a study [1] according to which drinking an additional one and a half liters of water per day could significantly relieve headaches.', 'Until strict clinical studies with a larger number of patients have been conducted, the effectiveness of increased water consumption cannot really be assessed.', 'However, if increased drinking can actually prevent headaches, the effect may not be particularly large.']",1,"While a study suggests that additional water consumption may alleviate headaches, the overall preventive effect remains unclear due to the lack of large-scale clinical studies.","Whether drinking more water can prevent headaches cannot be answered satisfactorily on the basis of studies conducted to date.

Well-done studies that run over a long period of time with a sufficient number of test subjects are scarce. Evidence for long-term safety and simultaneous efficacy is therefore lacking."
Are there health benefits to screening the general population for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as a precaution?,"['Recommendation against COPD screening The answer may surprise: such a precautionary examination does not bring any discernible health benefit.', ""If you don't have any symptoms yet and only learns about a COPD due to the screening, you may not have any benefit at all [1,2]."", 'Here, too, a population-wide COPD early detection does not bring any health benefit.']",2,"The sentences provide evidence that screening the general population for COPD does not offer discernible health benefits, aligning with the claim and suggesting a refutation.",Even people with moderately severe COPD may have little health benefit from starting treatment as early as possible. People without symptoms who are diagnosed with COPD only as a result of a screening test are therefore unlikely to gain much health benefit from drug treatment.
Can cow's milk cause iron deficiency in babies in the first year of life?,"[""Moreover, the infant can use iron from cow's milk much worse, because among other things the calcium and casein contained in it inhibits the absorption of iron."", ""Babies actually seem to suffer more from iron deficiency when they are fed cow's milk early on."", ""Only as far as iron deficiency is concerned, statements are possible: Seven out of eight studies suggest that early use of cow's milk in babies significantly increases the risk of iron deficiency.""]",0,"The sentences suggest that cow's milk may hinder iron absorption in babies and increase the risk of iron deficiency, implying a potential negative impact on iron levels.","Cow's milk is low in usable iron. Therefore, cow's milk appears to increase the likelihood of iron deficiency in the blood of babies. It is unclear whether animal milk increases the risk of type 1 diabetes or blood in the stool, or reduces the likelihood of allergic diseases."
Does drinking breast milk as a baby have a positive effect on later health and development?,"['In any case, it is proven that this form of nutrition has certain health benefits – such as a lower risk for some infectious diseases in infanthood [2] [4] [9] and the sudden death of children, as we have reported here.', 'In later life, the risk of obesity is somewhat reduced [5.6],the IQ of breastfeeding children seems to be a few points higher [7].', 'In summary, the authors believe that drinking breast milk does not produce any practical benefits.', 'For example, breastfeeding may help reduce the risk of certain forms of cancer in children [4] [8,9].']",0,"While some studies suggest health benefits such as reduced risk of infectious diseases, obesity, and certain forms of cancer in children, as well as a potential increase in IQ, the authors believe that drinking breast milk does not provide any practical benefits.","It is possible that children who have been exclusively breastfed for a long time are somewhat less likely to become overweight later on.

Does treatment according to the fascial distortion model help with chronic shoulder pain?,"['In the study, this form of fascia therapy shows advantages over classic treatment: the mobility of the shoulder is improved more, as is functionality.', 'The most important criterion was how far the mobility of the shoulder can be improved: in the group treated according to fascia distortion model, mobility improved on average in patients by 30 percent in six weeks, in the comparison group only by 15 percent.', 'Participants in the FDM group also performed significantly and clinically relevantly better in terms of functionality and strength.']",0,"The study indicates that fascial distortion model treatment results in greater shoulder mobility and functionality improvement compared to classic treatment, with an average 30% improvement in six weeks for the FDM group versus 15% in the comparison group.","Currently, there is only one randomized controlled trial of this type of therapy. It suggests that fascia therapy may help with some shoulder conditions."
Are there effective alternatives to the breathing mask (CPAP) for sleep apnea?,"['The authors of an overview of 2013 see such interventions as a possible alternative for those patients who reject the breathing mask: During the day of fatigue they lead to a similar improvement as standard therapy, but they are not so good at reducing breath loss [2].', 'However, since the breath loss has a decisive influence on subsequent diseases, standard therapy is preferable if possible.', 'Overall, oxygen therapy is significantly less helpful than CPAP [3].', 'Conclusion For patients who reject standard therapy with breathing mask, there are numerous other treatment options available – but these are not as effective in the decisive symptoms as CPAP.']",2,"While some alternatives for sleep apnea patients who reject CPAP masks can provide similar improvements in fatigue during the day, they are less effective in reducing breath loss, a crucial factor for subsequent diseases, as stated in the first and second sentences.","Although numerous other forms of treatment are available, some of them are too little researched or are clearly inferior to the standard therapy with CPAP."
Does closure of the foramen ovale prevent further strokes in people who have had a stroke of unknown cause?,"['If such patients have a PFO, surgical closure can be used to prevent further strokes.', 'Nevertheless, the data speak for the procedure; thus, even if the cause of the stroke is unknown, the risk of a further stroke can be reduced in at least those people who have an open foramen ovale.', 'All three individual studies provide very similar results and indicate that the closure avoids another stroke rather than just anticoagulant therapy with medications.']",0,"The sentences suggest that closure of the foramen ovale can prevent further strokes in people who have had a stroke of unknown cause, as long as they have a PFO, based on the results of individual studies comparing closure to anticoagulant therapy.","According to three large studies, closure of the patent foramen ovale can prevent another stroke better than purely drug treatment can."

Is tick-borne tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) much milder in children than in adults?,"['Although only 20 children participated in this study, there is a certain trend: young patients generally had less severe symptoms and recovered faster than adults.', 'Except for one case of complete vaccination and two cases of incomplete vaccination, the affected children were unvaccinated [11] and more frequently developed meningitis, while adults were more likely to fight with the more dangerous inflammation of the brain and cerebral membranes (meningo-encephalitis).']",0,"While unvaccinated children in this study more often developed meningitis and recovered faster than adults, they were also likely to experience meningo-encephalitis, suggesting that TBE severity may not be consistently milder in children than adults.","Current studies suggest that TBE is probably associated with milder symptoms in children than in adults. Permanent damage is also less frequent in younger patients. However, TBE can also have severe health consequences in children in individual cases."
"Does treatment with cyanoacrylate (for example, Sapheon Venaseal™) help against varicose veins as well or better than other methods?","['There are other scientific studies to close varicose veins with cyanoacrylate, but these do not meet current scientific requirements.', 'However, the efficacy cannot be assessed precisely, since the study authors had not compared their method to another treatment or sham treatment.', 'How good the method is compared to other methods has not been adequately studied [7].']",1,"The claim cannot be precisely assessed for cyanoacrylate's efficacy compared to other methods for treating varicose veins, as there is a lack of adequate studies comparing it to other treatments or sham treatments.","To date, there are no results from clinical studies on this method.

Is aluminum intake responsible for the development of Alzheimer's disease?,"['Cause unknown As far as the cause of pathological memory loss is concerned, research is still relatively in the dark.', ""However, due to the implementation of the study, it cannot be concluded that small traces of aluminium are actually the triggering cause of Alzheimer's disease.""]",1,"The current research does not conclusively link small traces of aluminum intake as the triggering cause of Alzheimer's disease, leaving the actual cause undetermined.","Scientific studies cannot prove with certainty a connection between the metal aluminum and the disease Alzheimer, but they cannot exclude it either."
Can regular exercise prevent or relieve migraine symptoms?,"['In a systematic overview from 2008 [ 2 ] of 7 studies with very low participation numbers, the authors conclude that sporting activity can probably lead to a slight reduction in the pain intensity of further migraine attacks.', 'A randomized-controlled study [ 3 ] in 30 migraine patients found at least a small reduction in the pain intensity of future migraine seizures for a combination program of aerobic training followed by muscle relaxation.', 'In another, less rigorous study [ 4 ] in 16 patients, compared to migraine patients who did not participate in any sports program, there was also a small reduction in pain intensity.', 'In a recent study from 2009 [ 5 ], the scientists found a similar improvement in the frequency of monthly migraine attacks.', 'Too little comprehensive investigations for clear effect In summary, a certain effectiveness of regularly operated endurance sports such as jogging or cycling for prevention of migraine attacks seems likely.']",0,"The claim is supported by a combination of a systematic overview, randomized-controlled studies, and a less rigorous study, suggesting that regular exercise, particularly aerobic training followed by muscle relaxation, can lead to a slight reduction in pain intensity and frequency of migraine attacks.","In some, but not all, studies, regular exercise seems to at least somewhat reduce the pain intensity of future migraine attacks. Whether the frequency of migraine attacks can also be reduced cannot be assessed with certainty. for this, larger, better validated studies would have to be conducted."
Does less than 7h of sleep daily increase mental performance?,"['Already six hours of sleep reduce brain performance The results of a small randomized-controlled study [1] clearly contradict the claim of performance-enhancing sleep loss.', 'After only a few nights it became apparent: the shorter the participants could sleep at night, the worse they did in the tests compared to the group with eight hours of sleep.', 'The performance of the sleep deficit group was significantly worse after five days compared to the control group, although the impact is limited by the small size of the control group.', 'This shows that lack of sleep actually seemed to be the cause of the worse mental performance.', 'Overall, if you sleep only six or less hours per night, you will hardly be wiser, but it seems to impair your mental performance.']",2,"The sentences provide evidence that less than 7h of sleep daily decreases mental performance, contradicting the claim.",Two small randomized-controlled studies indicate that mental performance decreases with the number of sleepless hours per night and the number of nights with insufficient sleep. No single scientific study provides evidence of an increase in mental performance due to shorter sleep duration.
Does regular intake of extra virgin olive oil protect against coronary heart disease such as heart attack?,"['Probably related to reduced risk of heart attack Many research groups have already studied the question of whether olive oil can actually reduce the risk of heart attacks and other heart diseases over the last two decades.', 'When eating more than 30 grams of olive oil per day, the risk of heart disease was only about half as high as in people who consumed less than 15 grams per day or no olive oil at all.', 'The olive oil-rich diet resulted in a significant reduction in the risk of heart attack and death for almost five years by just under a third compared to a conventional diet.', 'Study participants with high olive oil consumption were significantly less likely to be found in the group of heart attack patients, the scientists therefore concluded that the oil had a significant protective effect.', 'The results of the two most reliable and largest cohort studies [ 2, 3 ] indicate a likely protective effect of increased consumption of cold-pressed olive oil over several years.']",0,"The claim is supported by several studies indicating a reduced risk of heart disease and heart attack associated with regular intake of extra virgin olive oil, as well as a significant protective effect concluded by scientists.","Regular consumption of cold-pressed olive oil may possibly prevent coronary heart disease. However, direct evidence is still pending."
Do frequent ejaculations have a protective effect against prostate cancer?,"['Result: Men with frequent ejaculations between 20 and 30 years of age have a one-third reduced prostate cancer risk compared to those with rare ejaculations [1].', ""Taking the result seriously, it doesn't show that much self-satisfaction protects, but rather that men with very few ejaculations could have a slightly higher risk of prostate cancer."", 'Here it turns out that frequent ejaculations from the age of four years onwards or over the entire life span may reduce the risk of prostate cancer [3].', 'In sum, the study provides evidence that with increasing ejaculation frequency, the risk of prostate cancer could actually decrease.']",0,"The claim is partially supported by the evidence, as some studies suggest a decrease in prostate cancer risk with increasing ejaculation frequency from an early age or over the entire lifespan, but the protective effect is not explicitly attributed to frequent self-satisfaction.","A cohort study suggests that more frequent ejaculations starting at age 40, or over a lifetime, could potentially lower the risk of prostate cancer. This is not exclusive to ejaculations from masturbation, but from any sexual activity."
Does condom use cause depression in women?,"['Like any contraceptive method, the condom has disadvantages that it causes depression in women, but is nowhere documented.', 'Maybe less fun We have not found a study that specifically investigated whether the use of condoms in sex can lead to depression in women.', 'If condoms were to promote depression, it would be unlikely that depression would decrease if used more frequently.', 'They have found no correlations between condom use and depression [4].', 'Risk factors for depression In any case, condoms cannot be found in the list of recognised risk factors.']",1,"The claim that condom use causes depression in women is not supported by the provided sentences, which state that there is no specific study or correlation found between condom use and depression, and condoms are not listed as a risk factor for depression.",A study examining exactly this question was not found. Some scientific works with a broad question rather lead to the conclusion that there is no connection between depression and condom use.
Do today's children have a shorter life expectancy than their parents?,"['Overweight leads to a higher rate of premature deaths – which reduces life expectancy on average by 3 to 9 months.', 'So it would be a reversal of the trend: for the first time in a long time, children would have a life expectancy less than their parents.', 'There are some reasons to assume that it will be worse than the 3 to 9 months less: Obesity is becoming more common and occurs in increasingly younger children [1].', 'If this trend continues, there may be a reduction in life expectancy of three to five years.']",0,"While overweight is associated with a higher rate of premature deaths and obesity is becoming more prevalent in younger children, current data does not support a reduction in life expectancy of three to five years for today's children compared to their parents.","Obesity and physical inactivity are increasing risk factors worldwide that can shorten life. In 2005, a study from the USA concluded that life expectancy could be reduced by 3 to 9 months when these risks were included."
Does training on vibration platforms cause a noticeable buildup of muscle strength?,"['Therefore, training on vibration platforms could actually strengthen the muscle strength of the leg muscles.', 'However, compared to conventional strengthening training, the results do not indicate superiority of vibration platforms.', 'According to the results of this study, it could be concluded at most that training on a vibration platform in combination with a diet can lead to weight loss, which could also be achieved by a conventional fitness program or a mere diet without exercise program.']",0,"While training on vibration platforms may strengthen leg muscles to some extent, there is no evidence suggesting it is more effective than conventional strengthening training, and its primary benefit seems to be weight loss when combined with a diet, which can also be achieved through conventional fitness programs or diets without exercise.","Vibration training may be helpful for building muscle strength in the legs, but it is not better than conventional training for this purpose. Whether the method is also suitable for weight reduction has not been sufficiently studied."
Can apigenin reduce cancer risk or prevent cancer progression?,"['On the other hand, a laboratory study [5] found that apigenin might inhibit the effect of chemotherapy treatments.', 'However, when treated with apigenin, the cancer cells became resistant to this drug and did not die.', 'Apigenine without influence on cancer risk What applies in small cases could also apply in large cases.', 'This showed that those participants who had eaten the most apigenine with food were not less likely to have cancer than other women in the study.', 'Unefficacious and possibly risky Apart from laboratory findings, previous observational studies show that the potential protective effect of apigenin is not able to significantly reduce the risk of cancer in normal diets [8].']",2,"The claim is refuted by the sentences provided, as there is no evidence supporting apigenin's ability to reduce cancer risk or prevent cancer progression, and it might even hinder chemotherapy treatments' effectiveness.","Studies suggest that even high levels of apigenin in food do not protect against cancer.

Are animal-assisted therapies effective for mental illness?,"['The authors conclude from the data that animal assisted therapies may be effective in some diseases, including mental disorders and behavioural disorders such as depression, schizophrenia and addiction.', 'There is still no reliable data on the efficacy of animal-based therapy, for example in patients with cancer and advanced fatal diseases, in terms of state of health and quality of life.']",0,"The first sentence provides evidence that animal-assisted therapies may be effective for mental and behavioral disorders, but the second sentence indicates a lack of reliable data for their efficacy in patients with cancer and advanced fatal diseases, leaving the claim's applicability to all mental illnesses unsupported by the given sentences.","Studies on the effects of animal-assisted therapies are only partially conclusive. It seems plausible that animal-assisted therapies can be supportive for some mental illnesses; however, very large or rapid effects are unlikely."
Is breaking an energy-saving lamp harmful to health?,"['[3] If an energy-saving lamp breaks, the mercury contained therein escapes, among other things, in the form of mercury vapour.', 'However, these experiments did not directly investigate whether this could lead to signs of poisoning in humans.', 'Even if the safety limit has been exceeded in some cases, mercury vapour concentrations in the ambient air did not reach levels for which a health hazard is considered probable in any study.']",1,"While mercury vapor is released when an energy-saving lamp breaks, studies have not established a probable health hazard from increased mercury vapor concentrations in ambient air, even when safety limits were exceeded.","If an energy-saving lamp breaks, mercury vapor is released in quantities that can exceed the limits considered safe. Whether this can cause damage to health has not been directly investigated. However, after removal of the broken glass and good ventilation of the room, the value quickly falls back below the limit value."
Does copper intake increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease?,"[""Because there are no studies that associate an increased uptake of copper directly with an increased Alzheimer's risk [6].""]",1,The claim that copper intake increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease is not supported by a study directly associating increased copper uptake with an increased Alzheimer's risk.,Some studies claim to have found links between high copper levels and Alzheimer's disease.

Do smoking bans lead to fewer preterm births?,"['Smoking bans mean that mothers smoke less in pregnancy and that unborn women are exposed to less passive smoke.', 'It is a methodically very good work, but there are some limitations to the statements: the results of the individual studies vary greatly, whether the real effect is really 10% each, will only be able to clarify future studies.']",0,"The claim is partially supported by the first sentence, stating that smoking bans result in less smoking during pregnancy and reduced exposure to passive smoke for unborn women; however, the second sentence indicates variability in the results of individual studies and the need for future studies to confirm the exact effect.","A large review shows a 10% reduced risk of preterm birth. Due to some limitations, the evidence is nevertheless low, further studies from different countries will probably soon bring clarity."

Does increased time outdoors inhibit myopia in children?,"['In most of these studies [ 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11 ], various research groups discovered a connection between the extent of shortsightedness and the time spent by children and adolescents in closed spaces rather than outdoors.', 'In two studies [ 8, 9 ] there was also no connection between increased outdoor activity and reduced short-sightedness.']",0,"While many studies suggest a link between reduced time outdoors and increased myopia in children, there are also studies that found no connection between increased outdoor activity and decreased short-sightedness.","There is probably a correlation between reduced myopia and outdoor activities. However, it is not possible to say beyond doubt whether increased time spent outdoors is actually the cause of reduced myopia. Various other factors also play a role in the development of myopia."
Do household cleaners and room fresheners in spray form cause damage to the heart?,"['Risk to the heart little investigated The impact of detergents or household sprays on the cardiovascular system has so far been little investigated.', 'In particular, there was a strong correlation between abnormal heart rhythm and the use of fresh cleaning and space sprays, while the regular use of other perfumed household products was not accompanied by an unusual pattern of heartbeat.', 'Whether household sprays can directly increase the risk for cardiovascular diseases, however, cannot be derived from this with certainty.', 'Conclusion Whether household cleaners can affect heart health is not yet certain, a study that not only investigates ECG abnormalities but also the actual incidence of cardiovascular diseases after regular household cleaner use would be necessary.']",1,"While a correlation was found between abnormal heart rhythms and the use of certain household sprays, the data does not conclusively establish a direct link between household cleaners and increased cardiovascular disease risk.","There is evidence that people who often use household sprays more often have asymptomatic abnormalities of the heart rhythm. However, whether these abnormalities will later lead to disease, and whether household sprays are actually the cause, remains to be determined by larger and longer studies. Many, but not all, studies also show a connection between the frequent use of cleaning agents and an increased risk of asthma - even if other causes of this respiratory disease cannot be completely ruled out."
Can exercise improve mental performance impaired by alcohol consumption?,"['Because if these parameters are included in the calculations, the difference between the athletes and the non-sportsmen disappears.']",1,The disappearance of the difference between athletes and non-sportsmen when certain parameters are included in the calculations does not directly address the impact of exercise on mental performance impaired by alcohol consumption.,"There are only two studies that deal with this issue. Only one examines the problem in humans, and that is only a small pilot study. Whether sport reduces alcohol-related brain damage has not been clarified."
Can stress promote dementia?,"['However, according to the Internet magazine Vorarlberg Online, stress is also the most common reason for the emergence of dementia.', 'However, studies suggest that permanent performance pressure as one of many factors could be partly responsible for the development of age dementia [1] [2] [3] [4].', 'This suggests that the subjectively perceived stress level is more decisive for the risk of dementia than the actual workload.', ""Diabetes, depression, elevated cholesterol levels and smoking are among the factors that could also favour Alzheimer's disease [6].""]",0,"The claim is partially supported by studies suggesting a link between chronic stress and age-related dementia, but other factors such as diabetes, depression, high cholesterol, and smoking may also contribute to the risk of Alzheimer's disease.","There is evidence that chronic stress in work and private life may increase the risk of dementia in old age. However, this needs to be confirmed by larger studies. However, stress is only one of many possible influences."
Does the risk for the unborn child to develop asthma later on increase if the mother is exposed to high pollen concentrations during pregnancy?,"['However, the association with the increased pollen exposure does not exclude other causes of the increased asthma risk.', 'There is uncertainty about the cause of allergies and, subsequently, asthma.']",1,"The claim does not exclusively attribute the increased asthma risk in the unborn child to high pollen concentrations during pregnancy, acknowledging other potential causes and the uncertainty around the cause of allergies and subsequent asthma.",It is not clear whether a child later has an increased risk of asthma if its mother has contact with large amounts of pollen during pregnancy. Studies to date on this are rare and in some cases show methodological weaknesses.  Studies conducted according to strict criteria would be necessary to answer this question unequivocally.

"For women at high risk of breast cancer, does a precautionary mastectomy make more sense than regular participation in intensive screening?","['A direct comparison of the methods ""Screening"" and ""Precautionary breast removal"" is not possible on the basis of the current study situation: randomized-controlled studies are unthinkable, because even if the treatments to be compared are similarly effective, a random attribution to a treatment form would of course be unethical.']",1,"A direct comparison of precautionary breast removal and screening for women at high risk of breast cancer is not possible through randomized-controlled studies due to ethical considerations, making it difficult to determine the superiority of one method over the other based on the current study situation.","High-risk patients can significantly reduce their risk of breast cancer with preventive breast screening. Nevertheless, no general recommendation can be derived from this, as intensive screening programs are an alternative. However, good long-term studies are still lacking for both preventive measures, and the decision can only be made on a very individual basis."
Does tocilizumab specifically help children with rheumatoid arthritis (juvenile idiopathic arthritis) ?,"[""Although the data from the two children's studies are not as reliable as those from the larger and more numerous studies in adults, tocilizumab may be more effective in children with systemic JIA than in adults with rheumatic arthritis.""]",0,"The sentences suggest that tocilizumab may have a more significant effect in children with systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis compared to adults with rheumatic arthritis, but the reliability of this evidence is not as strong as that from adult studies.","In contrast to adult rheumatoid arthritis patients, where the efficacy of tocilizumab has been well studied, there are only 2 controlled studies for use in children on a specific subtype (systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis) with very few participants. These suggest better efficacy than in adults, but in reality this is likely to be lower than presented in the study results. In addition, the drug can also cause severe side effects."
Does the Toxoplasma gondii parasite affect suicide rates?,"['The study [1] cited in the newspaper article also finds a connection between infection and violence against mothers themselves, but this study cannot exclude possible other factors of influence.']",0,"The study mentioned does not definitively attribute increased suicide rates to Toxoplasma gondii infection, as it cannot rule out other influencing factors.","Meanwhile, some studies show a link between infection with the protozoan T. gondii and a higher suicide rate. However, it is not yet clear whether the parasite actually has an influence, because a third factor is also conceivable that influences both the infection rate and the suicide rate."
Is Exemestane better than other hormone-altering drugs for reducing the risk of breast cancer or treating it?,"['Therefore, it cannot be answered whether exemestan works better for the treatment of breast cancer than other aromatase inhibitors other than anastrozole.', 'There are still too few data to compare different aromatase inhibitors with respect to their side effects.']",0,"While exemestane's efficacy in treating breast cancer compared to other aromatase inhibitors, except anastrozole, is unclear, there is currently insufficient data to compare the side effects of different aromatase inhibitors.","The group of so-called aromatase inhibitors, which includes Exemestane, causes a higher survival rate in the treatment of breast cancer patients than other hormone-influencing drugs.

Does excessive beer or alcohol consumption lead to obesity?,"['In some studies, it seems to be exactly the opposite, beer lovers weigh less than little drinkers at the time of the survey.', 'In such a study, men who drank less than three litres a week even seemed to lose weight, and not to increase in weekly amounts of six litres or more.', 'Studies comparing beer with other non-alcoholic beverages other than non-alcoholic beer do not show a clear difference in weight.', 'One reason, according to the authors of an overview of 2011 [2], could be that wine drinkers may tend to become a healthier diet overall.', 'It is also possible that alcohol only has an influence on fat folds on the abdomen and hips from a large amount of time, but it does not lead to weight gain in moderation.']",1,"Excessive beer or alcohol consumption may not directly lead to overall obesity, as some studies suggest beer lovers have similar or even lower weights than lighter drinkers, and alcohol's impact on fat folds might only be noticeable over a long period. However, wine drinkers may adopt healthier diets, which could influence the relationship between alcohol and weight.","In some studies, alcohol consumption does seem to be related to weight gain. In other studies, however, there is either no effect or even the opposite effect. The study situation is contradictory."
Does unprocessed red meat increase the risk of cardiovascular disease?,"['They found no connection between the consumption of unprocessed red meat and heart disease.', 'However, the study results contradict each other, so we do not know whether meat can actually cause cardiovascular disease [4].', 'Whether the cause of the increased probability of disease was actually the consumption of red meat cannot be determined from the study data.']",1,"While some studies suggest no connection between unprocessed red meat and heart disease, other results are contradictory, leaving uncertainty about red meat's role in cardiovascular disease.","Whether unprocessed red meat increases the likelihood of cardiovascular disease is unclear, and study results are conflicting.

Does hawthorn extract help patients with heart muscle weakness (heart failure)?,"['Accordingly, it is also unclear over which time period and at which dose the herbal medicinal product should be taken and which patient groups could benefit from a hawthorn intake.', 'In most studies, patients suffering from heart failure took hawthorn preparations as an accompanying therapy in addition to their cardiac medications.', ""So we can't say whether the drug, the hawthorn extract or just the random factor affected the respective result."", 'In fact, those patients who had taken hawthorn were less short of breath, more resilient and showed increased physical performance in the stress ECG.', 'In this study, the intake of hawthorn did not improve the physical resilience or the quality of life of those affected.']",1,"While some studies suggest improvements in symptoms like shortness of breath and physical performance for heart failure patients taking hawthorn extract, other research indicates no improvement in physical resilience or quality of life, making it unclear which patient groups might benefit and the optimal dosage and time period for intake.",The results of the studies found differ significantly and leave more questions open than they answer.
Is glyphosate carcinogenic?,"['Of mice... in the debate about the different assessments, a lot is about studies in rats and mice.', 'Animal studies play a greater role in assessing risks than when it comes to the effectiveness of drugs.', 'Secondly, the animal studies show an increased risk of cancer only when the experimental animals receive a very high dose of glyphosate.', '...and humans In addition to animal studies, there are numerous studies with people on glyphosate The IARC derives from studies in humans a low evidence of an increased risk.', 'The disadvantage: not only the factor that you want to examine, but many other factors can influence the result – for example, when it comes to cancer, lifestyle, smoking, and much more play a role and, to a certain extent, mask the effect of glyphosate.']",1,"While animal studies suggest an increased cancer risk with high glyphosate doses, human studies provide low evidence of a heightened risk, which may be influenced by various confounding factors.","Depending on how much animal experiments and laboratory tests are weighted against studies on humans, one arrives at different assessments. With regard to human studies, we consider the question to be unresolved at present."
Does psychotherapy help with burnout?,"['Most of the studies on burnout symptoms deal with cognitive behavioral therapy.', 'According to a systematic review [1] Cognitive behavioral therapy seems to be able to alleviate the consequences of permanent stress in the longer term.', 'Physiotherapy showed no better success than standard treatment in a study after six or twelve months.', 'However, more studies would be needed to make a clear assessment.']",0,"The claim is partially supported by a systematic review indicating that cognitive behavioral therapy can alleviate the consequences of permanent stress in the long term, although more studies are needed to make a clear assessment.","Of the psychotherapy modalities, only Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) has evidence of potential efficacy for burnout. For other forms of psychotherapy, the scientific evidence is unclear or non-existent."
Is electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) in combination with ordinary fitness training more efficient than fitness training alone?,"['However, according to a meta-analysis summarising the results of 17 studies, the effect is no greater than in conventional strengthening exercises [ 1 ].', 'Full-body EMS as a fitness method hardly investigated While the electrical stimulation of individual muscle groups for therapeutic purposes was investigated by some research groups, there are hardly any scientific studies on the whole-body EMS as a fitness training replacement.']",1,"The claim is not supported by the first sentence, which states that a meta-analysis of 17 studies found no greater effect from EMS in combination with fitness training compared to conventional strengthening exercises alone.","There is evidence for the principle effectiveness of EMS for muscle strengthening.

For breast and ovarian cancer and cancer of the endometrium, it is unclear whether cancer risk is affected by milk and dairy products."
Does yoga change the genetic makeup?,"['The genes themselves remain unchanged, only their activity fluctuates; just as in each cell the activity of the different genes is adjusted according to current needs.', 'The difference between a liver cell and a muscle cell is not due to different genes, but to different gene activity.', 'The study shows that shortly after the activity, the gene activity differs from certain white blood cells in these two groups.']",1,"The genes themselves remain unchanged in yoga practitioners, with only their activity fluctuating according to current needs, which is consistent with the claim.",Yoga - like any other physical activity - can influence the activity of genes.

Does the drug fingolimod reduce the progression of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis similarly or better than previous drugs?,"['The recently newly approved active substance Fingolimod in Europe causes white blood cells (T cells) to be held back in the lymph nodes, which prevents them from causing inflammation by immigrating to the brain.', 'By means of systematic literature research, we wanted to find out whether fingolimod is similar to or better than previous multiple sclerosis – drugs can inhibit the progression of the disease.']",0,"The first sentence provides a mechanism for how fingolimod may affect multiple sclerosis, but it does not directly compare fingolimod's effectiveness to previous drugs, making it difficult to determine if the claim is supported or refuted based solely on this information.","Two manufacturer-funded clinical trials attest Fingolimod such efficacy that exceeds that of interferon beta therapy. However, the drug can also cause serious side effects."
Can cancer be successfully fought with intentionally induced fever?,"['==References== In the 19th century, the idea was born that fevers protect against cancer.', 'No major modern studies have been conducted in which deliberately triggered fever has been tested as therapy.']",1,"While the concept of fever as a cancer protector originated in the 19th century, no recent major studies have tested fever induction as therapy, leaving insufficient evidence to support or refute the claim.","In the early 20th century, cancer was indeed sometimes fought with fever, sometimes successfully.
