Can masks reduce corona infections when worn by a large proportion of the population?,"['Studies show slow spread After three years of pandemic, there are now relatively meaningful data that masks can slow down the spread of the Corona virus.', 'Surgical masks, in turn, seem to reduce the risk of infecting themselves with the corona virus.']",0,"The sentences suggest that masks can slow the spread of the corona virus and reduce the risk of self-infection, implying a potential for reducing infections.  
","International studies suggest that the number of corona infections decreases when many people wear masks - whether fabric, surgical or FFP2 masks. However, it is not possible to precisely quantify how great the protective effect actually is. It probably depends on the type of masks and the proportion of people who wear them."
Can homeopathic preparations with Anamirta cocculus help against dizziness?,"['But without success: We could not find any meaningful scientific evidence for effectiveness in dizziness.', 'It is now well proven by studies that homeopathic preparations usually do not work better than a sham medication (placebo) [8].', 'However, it is not well established that betahistine is effective against dizziness [11.13].', 'The fact that betahist helps with dizziness is not well documented [11, 13].']",1,"The provided sentences state that homeopathic preparations generally lack scientific evidence for effectiveness and that the effectiveness of betahistine for dizziness is not well documented.  
","We have found only one study that has investigated this. However, it is so poor that no reliable statement is possible."
Can zeolite alleviate or prevent health problems?,"['However, none of these can provide any evidence – because the studies have no significance (for reasons see section Studies in detail ).', 'It does not find an advantage for zeolite – but the results are hardly meaningful.', 'However, it is not researched whether the regular intake of zeolite can lead to a nutrient deficiency or has an undesirable effect on digestion.']",1,"The provided sentences highlight the lack of conclusive evidence regarding zeolite's impact on health, mentioning insignificant studies and the absence of research on potential negative effects.  
",Studies to date cannot provide any evidence that taking zeolite prevents or alleviates complaints. A detoxifying effect is not scientifically plausible.
Does paxlovid protect unvaccinated people with risk factors from severe or even fatal covid 19 disease?,"['Patients at risk without corona vaccination appear to be well protected from serious to fatal events by Paxlovid.', 'However, it is not certain how well Paxlovid helps people who have already received corona vaccination.', 'In addition, the scientists investigated whether Paxlovid alleviated the Covid-19 symptoms, shortened the duration of the disease and reduced the need for medical treatment: Half of the participants improved the symptoms with Paxlovid after 13 days, with placebo after 15 days.', 'With Paxlovid, 14 out of 1000 participants needed medical treatment for Covid-19 within a month, with placebo 76 out of 1000.', 'Whether with or without antibodies in the blood, Paxlovid basically protected all humans from a severe course.']",0,"The sentences indicate that Paxlovid appears to protect unvaccinated individuals at risk from severe COVID-19 outcomes, but provide limited information about its effectiveness in vaccinated individuals.  
","In a large, well-done study, paxlovid prevented hospitalizations and deaths in high-risk patients. They were unvaccinated and had contracted the delta variant. For vaccinated people, the benefit cannot be reliably estimated. This also applies to people with immunodeficiency."
"Does starting school later improve health, learning success, and quality of life in adolescents?","['However, teenagers and parents now have to be very strong: despite 27 studies involving hundreds of thousands of students, no clear results can be derived from research.', 'The problem: The studies usually come to contradictory results.', 'So until better research results are available, all troubled young people and parents will only have the option of remaining out of bed early – or to hope that, despite lack of evidence, the school management will still have an insight into it.', 'It is difficult to examine whether a later start to school will have a positive effect.', 'The Problems: Unknown Influencing Factors: If differences occur in previous-after-studies, these do not have to be due to the later start of school – they may also have been caused by other changes over the course of the study period.']",1,"The provided sentences highlight the conflicting research findings and difficulty in isolating the impact of a later school start time, making it challenging to determine its effects on adolescent health, learning, and quality of life.  
","The question has been investigated in several large studies. Due to methodological deficiencies and contradictory results, no firm conclusions can be drawn. This means that science can currently neither speak for nor against a benefit of a later school start."
Does the F.X. Mayr cure have health benefits? Can it prevent diseases or treat them?,"['Thus, the claim that the method can help with various diseases is not scientifically justified.', 'These studies cannot answer whether these changes also affect health.', 'Mayr cure or other fasting methods improve health in the long term, however, cannot be concluded.']",1,"The sentences state that scientific evidence does not support the claim that the Mayr cure helps with diseases and that long-term health effects are inconclusive.  
","It is neither examined nor proven whether the special fasting method after F.X. Mayr holds, which it promises: Namely assistance with all possible illnesses of allergies, over rheumatism up to sleep disturbances. The advertised detoxification and ""purification"" of the body by the chamfering cure are besides scientifically not plausible."
Does the consumption of soy foods or soy isoflavones affect the appearance of acne skin?,"['In both cases, certain soya ingredients are responsible for the effect on the skin: the isoflavones.', 'There are two competing theories that contradict each other: according to the first theory, isoflavones confuse the hormone balance and are supposed to promote acne in this way.', 'Surprisingly, despite searching in two large databases, we could not find a study on soy products and acne – whether soy milk, soy sauce or tofu.', 'The isoflavones improved the skin appearance more than an anti-acne cream with vitamin A acid (Tretinoin).', 'Conclusion: There is currently no evidence from reliable studies that soy makes acne worse.']",1,"While there are theories suggesting soy isoflavones could influence hormone balance and potentially worsen acne, no reliable studies have been found to support this claim.  
","We could not find any meaningful studies at all on the influence of soy foods on acne. On soy isoflavones, we found two small studies of questionable quality that examined a very specific group of sufferers. Soy isoflavones improved the skin appearance somewhat. However, this result is not reliable."
Does extract from the Damiana plant (Turnera diffusa) help with erectile dysfunction?,"['Efficacy does not appear to have been studied or demonstrated.', 'The studies in detail We could not find any studies on Damiana extract against erectile dysfunction in men.', 'Studies on the product Neradin also appear to be missing.']",1,"The provided sentences state that no studies have been found on the efficacy of Damiana extract for erectile dysfunction, making it impossible to determine its effectiveness.  
","The extract from the Damiana plant (Turnera diffusa) is advertised as a remedy for erectile dysfunction for men. However, this claimed effect on potency is by no means proven. It has apparently never been tested on humans. This also applies to homeopathic remedies such as the product Neradin."
Is the homeopathic remedy Neradin effective for erectile dysfunction?,"['No studies on Neradin Also our search for studies on the product Neradin remained resultless.', 'Studies on the product Neradin also appear to be missing.']",1,"The claim about Neradin's effectiveness for erectile dysfunction cannot be assessed due to the lack of available studies on the product.

Does regular HPV testing in addition to the recommended Pap smear detect more precancerous lesions than just the Pap smear alone?,"['According to the studies, the HPV test is likely to detect slightly more precursors of cervical cancer over several years than the PAP swab alone.', 'We are therefore relatively sure that with an additional HPV test at least a little more precursors of uterine cancer are detected than only with the PAP swab alone.']",0,"The sentences state that HPV testing, in addition to a Pap smear, likely detects a slightly higher number of cervical cancer precursors over time.  
","Regular examination of the cervix by means of PAP smear tests detects precancerous stages of the cervix in most cases in good time. This reduces the risk of developing cervical cancer. An additional HPV test every three to five years can make screening even more reliable. However, the difference should not be too great."
Can olive leaf extract reduce high blood pressure?,"['These studies therefore do not indicate whether olive leaf extract can help with significantly increased blood pressure.', 'Without success, however, we could not find any studies that investigated the effect of olive leaf extract on cardiovascular health.', 'However, they cannot provide clear answers.', 'It is therefore impossible to say whether olive leaves extract could have a better or worse effect with significantly increased blood pressure.']",1,"The provided sentences state that studies have not investigated the effect of olive leaf extract on cardiovascular health, making it impossible to determine if it can reduce high blood pressure.  
","Whether olive leaf extract lowers blood pressure has been investigated in five suitable studies to date. They all found no effect or only a slight effect of the extract. The problem with this is that most of the study participants had only slightly elevated blood pressure. They cannot answer how olive leaf extract works in people with significantly elevated blood pressure (hypertension). The studies also had gross flaws, few participants, and ran for a very short time. They cannot provide reliable answers."
Do green-lipped mussel preparations improve the symptoms of osteoarthritis?,"['Studies overall not meaningful The conclusion of our research: Scientific evidence for the claimed effect is missing.', 'It is also unclear whether the measured positive effects are large enough to actually be felt by those affected.', 'Whether or not green-lipped mussel helps with osteoarthritis cannot be said at the moment.', 'However, as early as 2009, the European Food Safety Authority considered that a protective effect of the green-lipped mussel on healthy joints has not been established.', 'In our opinion, no reliable conclusions can be drawn from the studies found.']",1,"The provided sentences express uncertainty about the effectiveness of green-lipped mussel preparations for osteoarthritis symptoms, citing a lack of conclusive scientific evidence and the need for further research.  
","The question was examined in four small studies with serious methodological deficiencies, which also arrived at partly contradictory results. No clear conclusions can be drawn from them. The claim that green-lipped mussel helps with osteoarthritis is not scientifically proven."
Can probiotics lower blood sugar in type 2 diabetes?,"['And if so, can probiotics reverse this change and reduce blood sugar levels again?', 'At the most small effect, they may actually be able to.', 'However, the effect of the capsules and tablets does not seem to be large: in the previous studies, they were able to reduce the long-term sugar level HbA1c by an average of 0.55 points.']",0,"While the sentences suggest probiotics might have a small effect on reducing HbA1c, they do not definitively state whether this effect is large enough to reverse changes in blood sugar levels.  
","The summarized results of studies to date suggest that probiotics in capsule or tablet form could lower blood sugar somewhat. At least if they are taken over a period of two to three months. However, the effect is not well established. Probiotic dairy products and probiotic powder for dissolving do not seem to have any demonstrable effect."
Can the so-called Tupler technique help against rectus diastasis?,"['No studies on the Tupler technique As intense as we were looking for, we could not find the promised studies on the Tupler technique.', 'The claim that this is a scientifically proven therapy for rectus diastase is therefore simply wrong.', 'The studies in detail We did not find any studies that investigated the effectiveness of the Tupler technique for the treatment of rectus diastase.']",1,"The claim is refuted because the provided sentences state that no studies were found investigating the effectiveness of the Tupler technique for treating rectus diastasis.  
",We could not find a single study that examined whether the Tupler technique actually works. And this despite the fact that providers of the method advertise that its effectiveness is scientifically proven.
Can laser irradiation of blood by infusion needle (hemolaser treatment) relieve discomfort or help with diseases?,"['It is also unclear by what mechanism blood irradiation with bundled red light – i.e.', 'red laser – should improve health.', 'Although the authors of the three studies found [1-3] claim to have established a clear efficacy of haemolaser treatment, none of the three studies is suitable to prove this.']",1,"The provided sentences express doubt about the effectiveness of hemolaser treatment due to the lack of clarity regarding its mechanism and the limitations of existing studies.  
",There is no scientific evidence that hemolaser treatment has a palliative or curative effect on health problems.
"In everyday life, when breathing with an FFP2 mask or ordinary mouth-nose protection, do you get as much oxygen as without a mask?","['As much oxygen as without a mask This fear is, however, unfounded, as previously conducted studies show [ 1,2 ].', 'Only in very strenuous sports (fast cycling to exhaustion) was the oxygen content in the blood with FFP2 mask slightly lower than without mask.', 'There was no difference in oxygen measurement with ordinary oral nose protection.', 'Breathing a little more strenuous The results thus contradict the rumor that masks would cause an oxygen deficiency.']",0,"The provided sentences state that studies show no significant difference in oxygen levels with FFP2 masks or ordinary mouth-nose protection, except for very strenuous activities.  
","Even if breathing with a mask can feel uncomfortable: According to studies to date, you get just as much oxygen with an FFP2 mask or mouth-nose protection as without a mask. This is true even when you are moving or exerting yourself. Only very intensive sports slightly reduce the oxygen content in the blood - but too little to endanger health."
Can CBD help with period pain?,"['Because despite searching in three different databases we could not find a single study on CBD in case of regular pain.', 'Scientifically, it is not sufficiently researched whether CBD actually promotes sleep, as providers claim.', 'The studies in detail We could not find any studies that investigated whether CBD can help with normal pain – neither for treatment nor for prevention.']",1,"The provided sentences state that no studies were found investigating CBD's effectiveness for regular pain, including period pain.  
",Whether CBD can relieve menstrual pain has apparently never been scientifically studied. We could not find any studies on this. Women who suffer from severe period pain should talk to a gynecologist about it. Diseases such as endometriosis could be behind it.
"Can a bioresonance device like ""Bioscan"" or ""Vieva Vital Analyser"" measure mineral and vitamin deficiencies or detect health problems?","['This experiment clearly shows that the devices studied are completely unsuitable to diagnose a lack of vitamins or minerals.', 'Sentenced for fraud at the end of May 2022, a German court also concluded that the Bioscan device cannot fulfil the claimed claims.', 'Claims for comparable products are equally implausible.', 'Even if 1000 subjects had participated in the study and only five to six people had shown such unreliable readings, such a device would be worthless for diagnostics.']",2,"The sentences present evidence from a study and a legal case concluding that the Bioscan device cannot accurately diagnose vitamin or mineral deficiencies.  
","An experiment shows that the devices cannot distinguish between healthy people, seriously ill people and a corpse. The claimed mode of action behind the measurement method is also scientifically implausible. A German court has convicted the manufacturers of the Bioscan device (not legally binding) of fraud."
Does arthroscopy (joint endoscopy) help with osteoarthritis of the knee joint?,"['What might sound logical, however, has a catch: the arthroscopy of osteoarthritis does nothing to the treated person.', 'Studies clearly speak against a benefit A research team summarized the most meaningful of all previously published studies on arthroscopy in knee arthritis.', 'In these studies, patients treated after arthroscopy had no noticeably less pain or movement restrictions than those treated only for appearance or not at all.', 'Arthroscopy against osteoarthritis: not effective, but also not very risky After all: Undesirable events were not conspicuously common in the arthroscopy groups either.']",2,"The sentences state that studies have shown arthroscopy does not provide noticeable pain relief or improved movement for patients with osteoarthritis, directly contradicting the claim that it helps.  
",The data are clear: Arthroscopy is useless as a treatment for knee osteoarthritis. It can neither relieve pain nor improve the function of the knee joint in the long term.
"Do dietary supplements containing silicon (e.g. as ""organic silicon"" or silica) have health benefits?","['So far it is also completely unclear what role the element silicon plays in the human body at all [8].', 'We have researched: Previous studies do not provide any evidence that dietary supplements with silicon support bone build-up and thus protect older women from osteoporosis and bone fractures in old age [1,2].', 'There is no evidence that silicon improves the hair structure [3,4], strengthens the fingernails [4] or makes the skin more beautiful and elastic [4,6,7].', 'Also that silicon supports the formation of collagen and connective tissue is only a conjecture [8].', 'Conjectures without studies Neither we nor the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) [8] were able to find clinical studies on any other alleged health benefits of silicon.']",1,"The provided sentences state that there is no scientific evidence to support the claimed health benefits of silicon dietary supplements, citing a lack of clinical studies.  
","There is no evidence so far that the additional intake of silicon can promote health. Also that it strengthens nails, skin and hair is an unsubstantiated claim. Moreover, it is unclear whether silicon plays any role at all in the body."
Can regular intake of cranberry juice or cranberry extract prevent recurrent cystitis in women?,"['The summarized results show that the regular intake of cranberry products could have a preventive effect.', 'There is also only evidence that cranberry products can prevent bladder inflammation for otherwise healthy women.', 'Overall, there is evidence of a possible preventive effect of cranberry.']",0,"While the sentences suggest a possible preventive effect of cranberry products against bladder inflammation, they specifically mention this effect only for healthy women.  
","Women who repeatedly have to deal with bladder infections might become ill somewhat less frequently if they regularly take cranberry juice or extract. However, this is not well established.

",St. John's wort is likely to relieve the symptoms of mild to moderate depression better than a placebo. It also appears to be similarly effective to approved medications for depression (antidepressants). St. John's wort preparations are generally better tolerated than antidepressants.
"Does the Zisano bracelet strengthen the immune system, increase endurance and performance or reduce fatigue?","['Whether such bracelets have an effect, for example whether they can actually increase physical performance or strengthen the immune system, has apparently never been investigated.', 'Bracelets for more performance: studies show ineffectiveness All five studies came to the same conclusion: the bracelets had no effect on the performance or well-being of the subjects.', 'A scientifically plausible explanation as to how exactly such bracelets should develop their effect remains to be found in their suppliers.', 'The studies in detail We could not find any studies on the Zisano bracelet or comparable bracelets with silicon chip.']",1,"The provided sentences state that studies have not found any evidence that bracelets like the Zisano bracelet have an effect on performance, well-being, or the immune system.

","We can neither clearly exclude nor confirm that there is an effect. In a total of 15 studies, no benefit could be demonstrated for high-dose vitamin D in adults with multiple sclerosis. Because the studies had many weaknesses, we cannot draw any conclusions about positive or negative effects."
Does taking taiga root extract strengthen the immune system? Can it make vaccinations more effective or tolerable?,"['Taiga Root and Immune Defense: Extensive Studies Missing In our extensive research, we have not found any studies that can demonstrate an immune-strengthening effect of the Taiga Root.', 'However, the studies were too small and inadequate for reliable results.', 'Whether the taiga root is beneficial to the immune defense can not be proven at the present time – but also cannot be ruled out.', 'The two available studies also do not provide any information on whether taiga root extract could even make vaccinations more effective.']",1,"While research on taiga root's impact on the immune system is limited and inconclusive, existing studies do not offer evidence to support its effectiveness in strengthening immunity or influencing vaccination outcomes.  
",The alleged immune-strengthening effect of taiga root (also called Siberian ginseng) has apparently never been investigated in appropriate studies. The positive effect claimed by dietary supplement manufacturers after vaccinations is also not proven.
Does short-term fasting improve quality of life in cancer?,"['On this basis, we cannot reliably say whether fasting during chemotherapy is actually useful or not, thus reducing side effects and improving the quality of life.', 'In terms of quality of life, there are already contradictions within the individual studies: in the study [1b], in which the participants switched between fasting and non-fasting after half of the chemotherapy, only in one group did the quality of life improve during fasting, in the other the quality of life did not improve.', 'Whether this is actually noticeable for cancer patients remains questionable.']",1,"The provided sentences highlight conflicting evidence regarding the impact of fasting on quality of life during chemotherapy, making it difficult to definitively say whether fasting is beneficial.  
",We found only three very small studies on both questions. Their results are so unreliable that we cannot make any assessment. So we cannot say whether the quality of life of those affected is improved and whether fasting during chemotherapy reduces side effects.
Does zinc preventively protect against covid-19 disease???,"['A preventive effect has not yet been researched in a single study.', 'It is therefore unclear whether the preventive use of zinc preparations protects against an infection with SARS-CoV-2 or a Covid-19 disease.']",1,"The provided sentences state that the preventive effects of zinc against COVID-19 have not been studied, making it impossible to determine if it offers protection.  
",The results of two studies on this suggest that sufferers with Covid-19 do not recover more quickly with zinc than without. A preventive effect has not yet been investigated in studies.
Do herbal remedies with nasturtium and horseradish alleviate the symptoms of cystitis as well as an antibiotic???,"['The antibiotic alleviated the discomfort faster than the product with capuchin cress and horseradish, after eight days there was no difference.', 'Therefore, the herbal agent is not likely to be a full substitute for an antibiotic.']",1,"The sentences state that the antibiotic was more effective initially, and while the herbal remedy eventually showed some improvement, it did not match the antibiotic's speed of action.  
","As for prevention, we have found only one small but somewhat reliable study. According to this, nasturtium-horseradish remedies probably cannot prevent cystitis.

Does skipping breakfast increase heart attack risk?,"['Obviously, therefore, the main reason for the increased risk of heart attacks was not to skip the morning meal, but overweight, diabetes, increased blood pressure, or too high cholesterol levels.', 'Thus, it is unclear whether the omission of breakfast leads to overweight or excess weight leads to the omission of breakfast.']",1,"The sentences suggest that other factors, such as weight and cholesterol levels, might be more strongly correlated with heart attack risk than skipping breakfast, making a direct link unclear. 
","There is no clear evidence that not eating breakfast could be a cause of obesity and, as a consequence, an increased risk of heart attack. It is possible, however, that it is primarily those people who are overweight and have a higher heart risk who forgo their morning meal."
Do whole grains lower the likelihood of dying early?,"['Against cancer, heart problems and diabetes The current study situation shows something else: Those who frequently resort to whole grains get less cancer or cardiovascular diseases, for example a heart attack [1–4].', 'Thus, people in whom whole grains play a major role in their daily diet seem to live longer and healthier.', 'All four summaries come to the same conclusion: They show a clear correlation between a full-grain diet and a reduced chance of dying early.', 'At least as far as the reduced risk of disease is concerned, the data show a robust dose-effect relationship: the more whole grains are eaten, the lower the risk of disease [6].']",0,"The sentences highlight a correlation between whole grain consumption and a reduced risk of diseases like cancer and heart problems, suggesting a potential link to increased lifespan.  
",People who eat whole grain products instead of foods made from refined flour are likely to live longer and probably have a lower risk of dying from cancer or cardiovascular disease.
Does regular consumption of energy drinks harm heart health?,"['Thus, energy drinks could potentially increase heart rate and blood pressure in the short term, but this is not the case in all studies.', 'However, the fact that the energy drinks had caused death is not certain.', 'There is no evidence that caffeine can cause cardiac arrhythmias or atrial fibrillation at moderate doses.', 'Larger doses of energy drinks can cause, for example, heart turf, tremor, arousal and digestive problems.']",1,"While some sentences suggest potential short-term effects of energy drinks on heart rate and blood pressure, others highlight the lack of conclusive evidence linking them to serious cardiac issues like arrhythmias or death.  
",This question is insufficiently researched. Larger studies over a longer period of time are needed to assess the heart risk from energy drinks.
Do light drinks promote obesity?,"['However, the fact that sweeteners actually affect blood sugar and insulin levels has not been proven.', 'The largest work, a summary analysis of three studies involving a total of 125,000 participants [7], comes to the opposite conclusion – light drinks should therefore reduce the weight slightly.', 'No scientific evidence whether artificially sweetened lemonades promote the development of overweight is therefore not yet available.']",1,"The sentences present conflicting evidence, with one study suggesting light drinks may slightly reduce weight while acknowledging a lack of conclusive evidence regarding their impact on obesity.  
","Several cohort studies show that people who frequently drink light drinks are more likely to be overweight. However, this does not prove that sweetener drinks make you fat. For it is equally conceivable that overweight people try to lose weight with light drinks. Whether they are successful in doing so is unclear."
Does coffee reduce the risk of dementia?,"['Scientists from Finland even want to find out that regular coffee drinking may also keep the brain fresh in the long term, in which it protects against dementia [1] [2].', 'And in fact, the scientists were able to establish a positive connection, but this effect seems to be above all a question of the coffee dose: the mental decline occurred most rarely during the course of the study in people who drank an average of one or two cups a day.', 'From the data from a total of eleven individual studies, the scientists concluded that people who consume a lot of caffeine had a reduced risk of dementia by about one-sixth (16%).', 'Further studies are necessary There are indications that people who drink a moderate amount of coffee daily are less at risk of developing cognitive disorders in the long term.']",0,"The sentences suggest a possible link between moderate coffee consumption and a reduced risk of dementia, but further research is needed to confirm this connection.  
",One to two cups of coffee a day may protect against mental decline in the long term. It should not be more than that. It is unclear where this effect comes from and whether other caffeinated beverages might also be protective.
Does sugar consumption increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes regardless of obesity?,"['Soft drinks increase the risk of diabetes People with a preference for large amounts of sugar-containing sodas also suffer more frequently from diabetes.', 'In their analyses, two research teams [1,2] were able to independently show that the more sugar the study participants consume in the form of soft drinks, the higher the probability of developing type 2 diabetes.', 'It seems that daily consumption of sugared soft drinks can trigger diabetes over many years even if it does not make you fat.', 'Sugar content of other foods with unclear influence The association with type 2 diabetes is relatively clear for soft drinks.']",0,"The sentences focus on the link between sugary soft drinks and diabetes risk, suggesting a potential connection even without weight gain, but don't address sugar from other food sources.  
","Sugar-containing soft drinks can - if consumed regularly - cause obesity. Obesity, in turn, increases the likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes. However, sugared soft drinks probably also increase the risk of diabetes independently of obesity."
Is less eaten from red plates?,"['The result: The test subjects who were served their pretzels on red plates accessed significantly less than participants with blue or white plates.', 'In a second experiment, subjects also drank soft drinks in a larger amount of blue instead of red cups.', 'As logical as this explanation may sound, the study does not yet provide scientific evidence that red plates really eat less.', 'In both salty and sweet snacks, the participants gained less when they were lying on a red plate in front of them.']",0,"While some sentences suggest that less is consumed from red plates, one sentence explicitly states that the study lacks scientific evidence to confirm this.  
","In two psychological experiments, participants were less likely to eat salty pretzels, popcorn or chocolate chips if they were served on red plates. It is unclear whether the effect lasts over a longer period of time."
Does breastfeeding reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome?,"['The scientists conclude that the risk of breastfed children is halved compared to un breastfed children [2].', 'However, the matter has a small catch: the studies analysed show a connection.', 'The studies in detail The fact that breastfeeding reduces the risk of unexpected death of a baby is only moderately secure.', 'However, this does not necessarily prove that breastfeeding is the reason for the lower risk of infant death.']",0,"While the sentences suggest a link between breastfeeding and a reduced risk of SIDS, they also acknowledge that the evidence is not conclusive and doesn't definitively prove causation.  
","Breastfeeding can possibly reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome, but this is not entirely certain. Other factors can also reduce the risk."
"Do boron preparations such as borax, boric acid, or calcium fructoborate relieve pain associated with age-related joint wear (osteoarthritis)?","['Even if their authors want to give a positive impression in their work – a critical look at the data shows that the Borax tablets could not alleviate arthrosis complaints among the participants.', 'There is no evidence that borax or boric acid can actually improve the discomfort in people with worn joints.', 'Those who suffer from chronic osteoarthritis pains and stiff joints and are hoping for relief through Borax should rely on more effective alternatives.']",1,"The sentences express skepticism about the effectiveness of boron preparations for osteoarthritis pain relief, citing a lack of evidence and suggesting alternative treatments.  
","The few studies on this are of poor quality and therefore not trustworthy. Moreover, there is no evidence that the human body needs boron at all."
Can glutamate in food cause intolerance symptoms?,"['There are many case reports of an alleged glutamate hypersensitivity, but these can hardly be verified.', 'But among the alleged glutamate-sensitive subjects there was no one who showed symptoms after all glutamate [3].', 'The available studies show that up to three grams of glutamate does not cause symptoms in a selected group of healthy individuals.']",1,"While there are anecdotal reports of glutamate sensitivity, scientific studies on healthy individuals have not found symptoms from consuming up to three grams of glutamate.  
","There is no conclusive evidence that the consumption of glutamate triggers complaints. However, since studies conducted to date have shown deficiencies, it cannot be ruled out that there are isolated individuals who react sensitively to large amounts of glutamate."
Does the Orthopulse device accelerate the orthodontic correction of malocclusions?,"['Little meaningful The three published studies [1-3] cannot convince: None of the studies actually investigates the entire duration of treatment, but only the speed of tooth movements in the correction phase of brace therapy.', 'This does not make any sure statements about the reduction of the overall duration of treatment with which the manufacturer advertises.', 'Theoretically, two effects of orthopulses would be conceivable: positive effects if the duration of treatment were shortened, or negative effects if conversion processes at the tooth root were accelerated.', 'Thus, it is also questionable whether the faster treatment with the orthopulse device actually results from infrared therapy: In the control group, the teeth move on average by 0.44 mm per week, in the group with the orthopulse device on average by 1.27 mm per week.']",1,"The provided sentences argue that while the Orthopulse device may accelerate tooth movement during orthodontic treatment, it's unclear if this translates to a shorter overall treatment duration as advertised.  
",Poorly done studies show that the device can accelerate tooth movement in the short term. Whether this reduces the overall treatment time has not yet been sufficiently proven. The methodological weaknesses of the studies also mean that the results are not very credible. Possible side effects have not yet been sufficiently investigated.
Is it harmful for the mental development of the unborn child if the mother regularly eats fish contaminated with mercury during pregnancy?,"['For previous studies suggest that the consumption of larger amounts of mercury-containing fish could slightly affect the mental performance of the offspring [1, 2, 3].', 'The studies in detail The fact that methyl mercury can damage the brain of unborn children already in concentrations in which the pregnant mothers themselves do not notice any symptoms is beyond question [6].', 'In investigations into the Faroe Islands and New Zealand, the assumption was confirmed: expectant mothers with high mercury levels were given children, whose mental performance was on average slightly worse in later tests than that of unloaded mothers – the mercury levels of the mothers were mostly so high, because they had consumed large amounts of contaminated fish before and during pregnancy.', 'Impact on the IQ Despite these contradictions, the consumption of contaminated fish seems to reduce the intelligence of the offspring measurable, although it is not yet clear how much.', ""A research team at Harvard University calculated an average reduction in the intelligence ratio of 0.7 points for each micrograms of mercury in mother's hair [2] in the analysis of studies from the Faroe Islands, Seychelles and New Zealand.""]",0,"The provided sentences suggest that consuming mercury-contaminated fish during pregnancy may have a negative impact on the mental development of the unborn child, citing studies that link high mercury levels in mothers to lower IQ scores in their offspring.  
","Many commercially available types of edible fish are contaminated with traces of methyl mercury. There are indications that regular consumption of such mercury-containing fish during pregnancy can impair the brain development of unborn children and thus their later mental abilities. In contrast, consumption of fish low in mercury could promote brain development in the unborn."
Can the consumption of caffeine during pregnancy harm the unborn child?,"['However, the study showed that it made no difference whether the participants drank around three cups of caffeine or decaffeinated coffee.', ""On average, the weight of birth at birth was about the same, was similar in size and was not more frequently born too early even after the mother's caffeine consumption."", 'Similar to the summary of the Cochrane overview work: In early pregnancy three cups of coffee daily would have no effect on birth weight, growth or premature birth [2].']",1,"The sentences state that a study found no difference in birth weight, size, or premature birth rates between mothers who consumed three cups of caffeine and those who consumed decaffeinated coffee.  
",There is insufficient evidence that moderate consumption of caffeinated beverages would have a negative impact on the child's development. Up to three cups of coffee a day does not appear to reduce the child's birth weight. Very large amounts of caffeine-containing beverages could possibly contribute to lower birth weight.
Are vegetables prepared in a microwave oven less healthy than those prepared in other ways?,"['Recent studies see the matter more differentiated: Depending on the variety of vegetables and the exact type of preparation, the microwave can sometimes be better and sometimes worse suited than, for example, cooking [2-12].', 'In the worst case, if it is exaggerated with the duration and the number of watts, the corresponding food is less health-promoting, but in no way harmful to health.', 'If there are health problems related to the microwave, then this is not because the microwave ingredients are destroyed or changed, but because it is simply too unhealthy to eat altogether.', 'The week-long feeding with always several times warmed up in the microwave has not led to any signs of poisoning in the animals.']",2,"The sentences suggest that microwave cooking can be as healthy or less healthy than other methods depending on the vegetables and preparation, and that while excessive microwaving might be less ideal, it doesn't inherently make food unhealthy.  
","How vegetables change during preparation is extremely variable. With any type of heating, ingredients can be lost or become more easily accessible. In sum, it cannot be said that preparation in the microwave is always a bad choice."
Can garlic extract reduce high blood pressure and thus the risk of cardiovascular disease?,"['Two better performed randomised-controlled studies provide cautious evidence that garlic can lower too high blood pressure [1].', 'However, even the results of these two studies are insufficiently valid for a clear assessment [1].', 'Whether garlic taken regularly can lower too high blood pressure and thus lower the risk of cardiovascular disease remains unclear for the time being.', 'At least in theory, there may also be interactions with anticoagulant drugs or side effects in persons with a tendency to bleed, as garlic is suspected to have an anticoagulant effect.']",1,"While some studies suggest garlic might lower blood pressure, the evidence is limited and inconclusive regarding its impact on cardiovascular disease risk.  
","Studies to date provide tentative evidence of a blood pressure-lowering effect of garlic. However, they are of too low quality to be able to prove a reduction in the risk of cardiovascular disease as a result of high blood pressure."
Can fructose damage the liver?,"['Fruit sugar as a cause not proven There are no meaningful indications for the assumption that fruit sugar is responsible for the development of the liver disease [1].', 'In other words, for the liver, it may not matter what kind of sugar you eat.']",1,"The sentences state that there is no evidence to suggest fruit sugar causes liver disease and that the type of sugar consumed may not be a factor for liver health.  
",There is no conclusive evidence for a possible liver-damaging effect of fructose.
Is matcha tea particularly healthy?,"['No recommendations, no warnings Due to the current study situation, it is therefore not possible to make specific recommendations for tea consumption.', 'The studies in detail Matcha is the trend for many consumers, but in scientific literature this special green tea hardly exists.']",1,"The claim about matcha tea's health benefits cannot be determined due to a lack of scientific studies on the topic.  
","There is a lack of conclusive studies on the health effects of specific matcha. However, there is some evidence that green tea in general may reduce the likelihood of dying prematurely, especially from cardiovascular disease."
Can acupuncture prevent migraines and tension headaches?,"['Acupuncture works... From chronic migraines or tension headaches Affected patients get significantly rare headache attacks when they not only take conventional medication, but also undergo prophylactic acupuncture treatment.', '...but as good as migraine medications Another point suggests that acupuncture has a valuable prophylactic effect – at least for migraine sufferers: Further studies showed that acupuncture can only partially prevent migraine attacks, but at least as well as common medications [1].']",0,"The sentences suggest that acupuncture, when combined with conventional medication, can reduce the frequency of headache attacks, potentially offering a prophylactic effect comparable to common migraine medications.  
","In the case of migraine, the preventive effect of acupuncture is probably similar to that of prophylactic medication. However, for both migraine and tension headaches, acupuncture performs only slightly better than sham acupuncture. Whether the pricking of traditional acupuncture points plays a role is unclear."
Can plant sterols or foods with them reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease?,"['However, it is unclear whether the intake of such high amounts of plant sterols – e.g.', 'Whether these results are a coincidence or whether the higher rate of cardiovascular problems are actually due to plant sterols and not to other causes is unclear.', 'Cholesterol is also different Whether plant sterols can actually reduce not only LDL cholesterol levels, but also the risk of cardiovascular diseases, has not been investigated in a single clinical study.']",1,"While the sentences discuss the potential impact of plant sterols on cholesterol levels, they highlight a lack of conclusive evidence regarding their direct effect on reducing cardiovascular disease risk.  
","Plant sterols do lower cholesterol levels. However, whether they also reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease has not been researched. Animal studies even provide evidence that plant sterols in large quantities could increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. Whether this also applies to humans has not been investigated."
Can too much iodine cause autoimmune thyroid disease and consequently hypothyroidism?,"['Individual studies suggest that too large amounts of iodine may be responsible.', 'Probably a variety of causes These study results suggest that Hashimoto disease is more likely to occur in people with particularly high iodine consumption.', 'However, large amounts of iodine may cause serious disturbances in people with potentially undetected thyroid problems [8].', 'The studies in detail Whether large amounts of iodine can actually cause inflammation of the thyroid gland by an overreacting immune system is not well protected.', 'The result: the higher the iodine intake in a region, the greater the proportion of residents who suffer from autoimmune thyroid inflammation.']",0,"While some studies suggest a correlation between high iodine intake and autoimmune thyroid disease, further research is needed to determine if excessive iodine directly causes inflammation of the thyroid gland.  
",Autoimmune thyroid disease appears to occur more frequently in individuals with high iodine consumption. Whether high levels of iodine actually cause this disease has not been conclusively determined.
Is the sweetener aspartame harmful to health?,"['The result: the sweetener is in all probability safe.', 'Safety levels Based on the results of numerous studies in laboratory animals and humans, the scientists established a safety limit for aspartame.', 'Thus, every person can take 40 milligrams per kilogram of body weight every day for the rest of his life without fear of health consequences.', 'Even those who exceed this amount will not suffer any health hazard.']",2,"The sentences state that aspartame is safe based on studies and establish a daily intake limit without negative health consequences.  
","Health damage from aspartame is unlikely. This also applies to people who consume aspartame-sweetened foods and beverages in large quantities over a long period of time. However, in people suffering from the hereditary disease phenylketonuria (PKU), aspartame can cause nerve and brain damage."
Do diets with primarily or exclusively uncooked foods have health benefits?,"['Whether raw food followers suffer a heart attack or stroke less often, need less medication or live longer overall, can not be derived from this.', 'Conclusion A health benefit of raw food, which goes beyond an increased consumption of vegetable foods, has not been conclusively proven.', 'Rather, there are indications that strict raw food diets may also have a negative impact on health – similar to other diets that severely restrict food selection.']",1,"The provided sentences state that there is no conclusive evidence to support the claim of health benefits from raw food diets beyond increased vegetable consumption, and suggest potential negative impacts.  
","In studies, we have not been able to find convincing evidence that raw foods provide health benefits over healthy diets that include cooked foods. On the contrary, there is also evidence of possible harm."
Can increased water consumption prevent migraines or other headaches?,"['Preventive effect of water unclear In 2011, Dutch researchers published a study [1] according to which drinking an additional one and a half liters of water per day could significantly relieve headaches.', 'Until strict clinical studies with a larger number of patients have been conducted, the effectiveness of increased water consumption cannot really be assessed.', 'However, if increased drinking can actually prevent headaches, the effect may not be particularly large.']",1,"While a study suggests increased water consumption might relieve headaches, further research is needed to determine if it can prevent them and to what extent.  
","Whether drinking more water can prevent headaches cannot be answered satisfactorily on the basis of studies conducted to date. If there is an effect, however, it is likely to be very small."

","Due to the number of studies, it is unclear for a number of supposedly appetite-suppressing dietary supplements whether they can support successful weight loss. Well-done studies that run over a long period of time with a sufficient number of test subjects are scarce. Evidence for long-term safety and simultaneous efficacy is therefore lacking."
Are there health benefits to screening the general population for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as a precaution?,"['Recommendation against COPD screening The answer may surprise: such a precautionary examination does not bring any discernible health benefit.', ""If you don't have any symptoms yet and only learns about a COPD due to the screening, you may not have any benefit at all [1,2]."", 'Here, too, a population-wide COPD early detection does not bring any health benefit.']",2,"The sentences state that precautionary COPD screening does not provide any health benefits, even if it detects the disease in asymptomatic individuals.  
",Even people with moderately severe COPD may have little health benefit from starting treatment as early as possible. People without symptoms who are diagnosed with COPD only as a result of a screening test are therefore unlikely to gain much health benefit from drug treatment.
Can cow's milk cause iron deficiency in babies in the first year of life?,"[""Moreover, the infant can use iron from cow's milk much worse, because among other things the calcium and casein contained in it inhibits the absorption of iron."", ""Babies actually seem to suffer more from iron deficiency when they are fed cow's milk early on."", ""Only as far as iron deficiency is concerned, statements are possible: Seven out of eight studies suggest that early use of cow's milk in babies significantly increases the risk of iron deficiency.""]",0,"The provided sentences suggest that cow's milk can hinder iron absorption in babies and increase the risk of iron deficiency.  
","Cow's milk is low in usable iron. Therefore, cow's milk appears to increase the likelihood of iron deficiency in the blood of babies. It is unclear whether animal milk increases the risk of type 1 diabetes or blood in the stool, or reduces the likelihood of allergic diseases."

","Studies on this topic are very inconsistent. Nevertheless, there is a possibility that vitamin E increases the risk of death. A meta-analysis warns against high-dose vitamin preparations."
Does meditation help against stress?,"['Stress reduction in healthy people is shown, but not whether it is actually due to treatment.', 'A new review [3] summarizes 47 studies and brings better data – even if things remain complicated: Although some forms of meditation work against stress, only in comparison to control groups that receive no other targeted treatment.', 'The authors of an overview of mindfulness-based stress reduction [4] report in their summary that this form of therapy improves mental health, both in healthy people and in some patients with mental illnesses.', 'According to the systematic review work of 2014, not all types of meditation are equally effective: for mindfulness-based meditation, an effectiveness can be demonstrated, but not for transcendental meditation, in which the concentration of attention is sought to dissolve [3].']",0,"While some forms of meditation, like mindfulness-based meditation, show promise in reducing stress compared to no treatment, the evidence for other types, like transcendental meditation, is inconclusive.  
","Various forms of meditation seem to be able to alleviate stress both in healthy individuals and in people with mental illness. Studies on this are numerous, but the quality of the studies is consistently unsatisfactory."
Does eye training help prevent myopia?,"['A systematic review did not find a controlled study in 2005 that could show an effect of eye training on shortsightedness – nor any that would suggest a preventive effect of eye training [1].', 'For other forms of falseness, there are also small and methodologically weak studies that find no difference between eye training and a control group [1].', 'But in most cases there is no evidence of the effect of visual training [1] [3].']",2,"The provided sentences cite systematic reviews and studies that found no evidence of eye training preventing myopia or showing any significant effect on shortsightedness.  
","According to the current state of studies, an effectiveness of eye training can only be expected for very few diseases; an effect as prevention or therapy against myopia cannot be assumed at present."
Does Cryolipolysis cause noticeable body fat reduction?,"['Whether the method can effectively reduce body fat cannot be said based on its results.', 'Whether the reason for the alleged figure improvements after three to six or twelve months was actually the cold treatment, however, can not be determined by previous-after-comparisons without an untreated control group anyway.', 'Even if the authors of previously published studies conjure the effectiveness of cryolipolysis – this cannot be objectively assessed on the basis of their results.']",1,"The provided sentences argue that the effectiveness of cryolipolysis for body fat reduction cannot be definitively determined based on existing studies due to the lack of control groups and objective assessment methods.  
","The effectiveness of cryolipolysis cannot be assessed objectively, as there are no scientific efficacy studies on it."
Is acupuncture for chronic pain more effective than placebo acupuncture treatment?,"['Acupuncture slightly surpasses dummy treatment A recent study is now to show that the pain-relieving effect of acupuncture exceeds that of a mere placebo effect, several media write.', 'The very thorough analysis of all these clinical studies showed that acupuncture in chronic pain was not only better than no treatment, but also slightly better than a sham acupuncture.', 'Also in fibromyalgia, a chronic pain disorder of the musculature, acupuncture probably has a slight, but hardly noticeably better effect than sham acupuncture [9].', 'Even if the mechanism of action of acupuncture is unknown and the placebo effect is partly responsible for its analgesic effect, it appears to be an interesting alternative or additional therapy for patients with chronic pain.']",0,"The sentences indicate that acupuncture shows a slight advantage over placebo acupuncture in managing chronic pain, though the exact mechanism remains unclear.  
","Acupuncture is slightly superior to sham acupuncture treatment for some types of pain. However, pain patients are unlikely to notice this difference."
Does treatment with radioactive agents help with pain in chronic inflammatory joint disease?,"['If the correct amount of a suitable radioactive substance is injected directly into the joint, the radiation causes the swollen and inflamed joint mucosa to die – after healing, a healthy skin can grow back, the inflammation is gone [1].', 'According to a 2009 overview study, success rates in small joints vary from 54 to 100 percent pain reduction 12 months after treatment, from 29 to 94 percent pain reduction in large joints [1].', 'A somewhat recent randomized-controlled study compared two drugs for radiosynoviorthesis and cortisone: after 48 weeks, the frequently used yttrium performed better than cortisone and the comparator, but only in a single point – namely on a particular pain scale.']",0,"While the sentences describe potential pain reduction from radioactive treatment and a study showing its effectiveness on a specific pain scale, they do not definitively conclude whether it helps with pain in all cases of chronic inflammatory joint disease.  
","Depending on the cause of the pain, radiosynoviorthesis can lead to considerable pain reduction, as confirmed by a 2009 review. However, it is not proven whether the treatment is more effective than cortisone treatment."
Can the active ingredient acetyl salicylic acid (ASA) protect against cancer?,"['Minor reduction in cancer risk According to a recent systematic review [ 1 ], daily intake of ASA actually results in a minor reduction in cancer risk.', 'Among 1000 subjects who took ASA, 16 people died of cancer on average, while those who received only an ineffective dummy medication (placebo) were19.', 'In a cohort study over ten years, the intake of ASA only led to a reduced risk of colorectal cancer every other day, but also to increased gastrointestinal bleeding [5].']",0,"While the sentences suggest a minor reduction in cancer risk with ASA intake and a reduced risk of colorectal cancer specifically, they also highlight increased gastrointestinal bleeding as a potential side effect.  
","Taking ASA daily for several years seems to be able to reduce the risk of dying from cancer somewhat. However, it increases the risk of severe internal bleeding and stomach problems."
Is tick-borne tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) much milder in children than in adults?,"['Although only 20 children participated in this study, there is a certain trend: young patients generally had less severe symptoms and recovered faster than adults.', 'Except for one case of complete vaccination and two cases of incomplete vaccination, the affected children were unvaccinated [11] and more frequently developed meningitis, while adults were more likely to fight with the more dangerous inflammation of the brain and cerebral membranes (meningo-encephalitis).']",0,"While the study suggests children may experience less severe symptoms and faster recovery, it also indicates a higher likelihood of meningitis in children compared to adults who are more prone to meningo-encephalitis.  
","Current studies suggest that TBE is probably associated with milder symptoms in children than in adults. Permanent damage is also less frequent in younger patients. However, TBE can also have severe health consequences in children in individual cases."
"Does treatment with cyanoacrylate (for example, Sapheon Venaseal™) help against varicose veins as well or better than other methods?","['There are other scientific studies to close varicose veins with cyanoacrylate, but these do not meet current scientific requirements.', 'However, the efficacy cannot be assessed precisely, since the study authors had not compared their method to another treatment or sham treatment.', 'How good the method is compared to other methods has not been adequately studied [7].']",1,"The provided sentences state that while there are studies on cyanoacrylate for varicose veins, they lack comparisons to other treatments or control groups, making it impossible to assess its effectiveness relative to other methods.  
","To date, there are no results from clinical studies on this method. The efficacy in comparison with other treatments is therefore unclear."
"Did oseltamivir (Tamiflu®) or other neuraminidase inhibitors help reduce deaths from the H1N1 influenza virus (""swine flu"" virus)?","['It is striking that the raw data do not show a significant difference in the death rate between neuraminidase inhibitors and untreated patients.', 'Tamiflu alone did not investigate whether the Tamiflu active substance oseltamivir saved lives during the H1N1 pandemic was not investigated separately in the study funded by the Tamiflu manufacturer.']",1,"The sentences highlight that the study funded by the Tamiflu manufacturer did not specifically investigate whether oseltamivir saved lives during the H1N1 pandemic, and the raw data does not show a significant difference in death rates between those who received neuraminidase inhibitors and those who did not.  
","Previously published analyses of data from the H1N1 influenza (""swine flu"") pandemic period are of insufficient quality to answer this question."
Is aluminum intake responsible for the development of Alzheimer's disease?,"['Cause unknown As far as the cause of pathological memory loss is concerned, research is still relatively in the dark.', ""However, due to the implementation of the study, it cannot be concluded that small traces of aluminium are actually the triggering cause of Alzheimer's disease.""]",1,"While the cause of Alzheimer's disease is still unknown, the study's findings do not definitively establish a link between aluminum intake and the development of the disease.

Can regular exercise prevent or relieve migraine symptoms?,"['In a systematic overview from 2008 [ 2 ] of 7 studies with very low participation numbers, the authors conclude that sporting activity can probably lead to a slight reduction in the pain intensity of further migraine attacks.', 'A randomized-controlled study [ 3 ] in 30 migraine patients found at least a small reduction in the pain intensity of future migraine seizures for a combination program of aerobic training followed by muscle relaxation.', 'In another, less rigorous study [ 4 ] in 16 patients, compared to migraine patients who did not participate in any sports program, there was also a small reduction in pain intensity.', 'In a recent study from 2009 [ 5 ], the scientists found a similar improvement in the frequency of monthly migraine attacks.', 'Too little comprehensive investigations for clear effect In summary, a certain effectiveness of regularly operated endurance sports such as jogging or cycling for prevention of migraine attacks seems likely.']",0,"While some studies suggest a potential link between regular endurance exercise and reduced migraine pain intensity and frequency, the limited number of participants and varying study designs prevent a definitive conclusion.  
","In some, but not all, studies, regular exercise seems to at least somewhat reduce the pain intensity of future migraine attacks. Whether the frequency of migraine attacks can also be reduced cannot be assessed with certainty. for this, larger, better validated studies would have to be conducted."
Does less than 7h of sleep daily increase mental performance?,"['Already six hours of sleep reduce brain performance The results of a small randomized-controlled study [1] clearly contradict the claim of performance-enhancing sleep loss.', 'After only a few nights it became apparent: the shorter the participants could sleep at night, the worse they did in the tests compared to the group with eight hours of sleep.', 'The performance of the sleep deficit group was significantly worse after five days compared to the control group, although the impact is limited by the small size of the control group.', 'This shows that lack of sleep actually seemed to be the cause of the worse mental performance.', 'Overall, if you sleep only six or less hours per night, you will hardly be wiser, but it seems to impair your mental performance.']",2,"The sentences describe a study where participants who slept less than seven hours performed worse on tests compared to those who slept eight hours, suggesting that insufficient sleep negatively impacts mental performance.  
",Two small randomized-controlled studies indicate that mental performance decreases with the number of sleepless hours per night and the number of nights with insufficient sleep. No single scientific study provides evidence of an increase in mental performance due to shorter sleep duration.
Does regular intake of extra virgin olive oil protect against coronary heart disease such as heart attack?,"['Probably related to reduced risk of heart attack Many research groups have already studied the question of whether olive oil can actually reduce the risk of heart attacks and other heart diseases over the last two decades.', 'When eating more than 30 grams of olive oil per day, the risk of heart disease was only about half as high as in people who consumed less than 15 grams per day or no olive oil at all.', 'The olive oil-rich diet resulted in a significant reduction in the risk of heart attack and death for almost five years by just under a third compared to a conventional diet.', 'Study participants with high olive oil consumption were significantly less likely to be found in the group of heart attack patients, the scientists therefore concluded that the oil had a significant protective effect.', 'The results of the two most reliable and largest cohort studies [ 2, 3 ] indicate a likely protective effect of increased consumption of cold-pressed olive oil over several years.']",0,"The sentences suggest a link between regular olive oil consumption and a reduced risk of heart attack, citing studies that show lower heart disease rates and fewer heart attack occurrences in those who consume more olive oil.  
","Regular consumption of cold-pressed olive oil may possibly prevent coronary heart disease. However, direct evidence is still pending."
Do frequent ejaculations have a protective effect against prostate cancer?,"['Result: Men with frequent ejaculations between 20 and 30 years of age have a one-third reduced prostate cancer risk compared to those with rare ejaculations [1].', ""Taking the result seriously, it doesn't show that much self-satisfaction protects, but rather that men with very few ejaculations could have a slightly higher risk of prostate cancer."", 'Here it turns out that frequent ejaculations from the age of four years onwards or over the entire life span may reduce the risk of prostate cancer [3].', 'In sum, the study provides evidence that with increasing ejaculation frequency, the risk of prostate cancer could actually decrease.']",0,"The sentences suggest a correlation between frequent ejaculation and a reduced risk of prostate cancer, citing studies that show this trend across different age ranges.  
","A cohort study suggests that more frequent ejaculations starting at age 40, or over a lifetime, could potentially lower the risk of prostate cancer. This is not exclusive to ejaculations from masturbation, but from any sexual activity."
Does condom use cause depression in women?,"['Like any contraceptive method, the condom has disadvantages that it causes depression in women, but is nowhere documented.', 'Maybe less fun We have not found a study that specifically investigated whether the use of condoms in sex can lead to depression in women.', 'If condoms were to promote depression, it would be unlikely that depression would decrease if used more frequently.', 'They have found no correlations between condom use and depression [4].', 'Risk factors for depression In any case, condoms cannot be found in the list of recognised risk factors.']",1,"The sentences state that no studies have found a link between condom use and depression, and condoms are not recognized as a risk factor for depression.  
",A study examining exactly this question was not found. Some scientific works with a broad question rather lead to the conclusion that there is no connection between depression and condom use.
Do today's children have a shorter life expectancy than their parents?,"['Overweight leads to a higher rate of premature deaths – which reduces life expectancy on average by 3 to 9 months.', 'So it would be a reversal of the trend: for the first time in a long time, children would have a life expectancy less than their parents.', 'There are some reasons to assume that it will be worse than the 3 to 9 months less: Obesity is becoming more common and occurs in increasingly younger children [1].', 'If this trend continues, there may be a reduction in life expectancy of three to five years.']",0,"The sentences suggest that rising childhood obesity could lead to a decrease in life expectancy for children compared to their parents.  
","Obesity and physical inactivity are increasing risk factors worldwide that can shorten life. In 2005, a study from the USA concluded that life expectancy could be reduced by 3 to 9 months when these risks were included."
Do rising temperatures and CO2 levels increase the risk of pollen allergy?,"['It is unclear whether the increase in CO2 has already caused a noticeable increase in the amount of pollen released.', 'Influence on allergy risk unclear However, whether the increasing pollen exposure also increases the risk of developing pollen allergy for non-allergic agents is unclear.', 'Whether higher levels of pollen increase the probability of hay fever is so far unclear [5].', 'There is nothing to read about pollen becoming more aggressive in so far published studies.']",1,"The provided sentences express uncertainty about the relationship between rising temperatures, CO2 levels, and the risk of pollen allergy, stating that the impact on allergy risk and pollen aggression remains unclear.  
","Rising temperatures and increased CO2 concentrations cause plants to produce larger amounts of pollen over a longer period of time. However, it is unclear whether larger amounts of pollen and a longer pollen season increase the likelihood of developing pollen allergy."
Does training on vibration platforms cause a noticeable buildup of muscle strength?,"['Therefore, training on vibration platforms could actually strengthen the muscle strength of the leg muscles.', 'However, compared to conventional strengthening training, the results do not indicate superiority of vibration platforms.', 'According to the results of this study, it could be concluded at most that training on a vibration platform in combination with a diet can lead to weight loss, which could also be achieved by a conventional fitness program or a mere diet without exercise program.']",0,"While the sentences suggest vibration platforms might contribute to leg muscle strength, they also indicate that conventional training methods are more effective.  
","Vibration training may be helpful for building muscle strength in the legs, but it is not better than conventional training for this purpose. Whether the method is also suitable for weight reduction has not been sufficiently studied."
Does glucosamine prolong life?,"['This is exactly what happens once again in the article on glucosamine as a life prolonger: The study was conducted on nematodes (fade worms) and mice and in which glucosamine led to an extended life span [1].', 'The conclusion of the researchers: If glucosamine has the same effect in two different species and these processes are also conceivable in humans, then glucosamine is highly likely to prolong life expectancy in humans.', 'Yes, with many limitations There is a cohort study on humans on this question: In 2010, a first evaluation looked at the influence of 20 vitamins or dietary supplements on life expectancy [3]; of these 20 only glucosamine and chondroitin showed a possible relationship with life expectancy.', 'The researchers speculate that glucosamine prolongs life expectancy just as was found in aspirin [2].', 'Until then, the life-prolonging effect of glucosamine remains optimistic speculation with little evidence.']",0,"While some studies suggest a possible link between glucosamine and extended lifespan in nematodes, mice, and potentially humans, the evidence remains limited and speculative. 
","Although research here is still in its infancy and there is only one cohort study in humans besides basic studies, this shows possible effects. Further studies with better methods and other groups of participants are necessary."
Does Kinesio tape help in the treatment of joint and muscle injuries?,"['Therefore, it cannot be said whether the tape could contribute to the improvement of the pain after a long period of time.', 'Overall, the efficacy of Kinesio tape in musculoskeletal pain and injuries is at best unclear.', 'Since no studies have been carried out for more than 6 days, however, nothing can be said about a possible longer-term effect of the tape.']",1,"The provided sentences express uncertainty about the long-term effects of Kinesio tape on joint and muscle injuries due to a lack of studies examining its impact beyond six days.  
",There is no evidence that kinesio tape can reduce pain within a few days. It is unclear whether taping can help improve movement restrictions caused by an injury.
Do injections with Botulinum Toxin A (Botox®) help with urinary incontinence?,"['According to the standard, Botulinum Toxin A (known as Botox®) has been approved in Ireland and possibly other European countries for the treatment of incontinence caused by multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injuries.', 'Efficacy of Botulinum Toxin A A summary of the results of 19 randomised-controlled studies, each with a relatively small number of participants, shows good efficacy [1].', ""Therefore, a single series of injections with Botulinum Toxin A in the bladder's detrusor muscle can significantly reduce the frequency of urinary loss in patients with incontinence.""]",0,"The sentences state that Botox® has been approved for treating incontinence caused by specific conditions and that studies show it can be effective, suggesting it may help reduce urinary loss.  
","Several small randomized-controlled trials show that injections of botulinum toxin A into the detrusor muscle surrounding the urinary bladder can reduce, but not completely prevent, the incidence of involuntary urinary leakage."
Can apigenin reduce cancer risk or prevent cancer progression?,"['On the other hand, a laboratory study [5] found that apigenin might inhibit the effect of chemotherapy treatments.', 'However, when treated with apigenin, the cancer cells became resistant to this drug and did not die.', 'Apigenine without influence on cancer risk What applies in small cases could also apply in large cases.', 'This showed that those participants who had eaten the most apigenine with food were not less likely to have cancer than other women in the study.', 'Unefficacious and possibly risky Apart from laboratory findings, previous observational studies show that the potential protective effect of apigenin is not able to significantly reduce the risk of cancer in normal diets [8].']",2,"The sentences present observational studies and laboratory findings that suggest apigenin may not effectively reduce cancer risk or prevent cancer progression.  
","Studies suggest that even high levels of apigenin in food do not protect against cancer. In individual cases, it is suspected that apigenin in high amounts could weaken the effect of chemotherapy or even accelerate cancer growth."
Do generic drugs work as well as original drugs?,"['Results & Interpretation In a review of 7 individual studies [1] published in 2010, three active substances against epilepsy were compared with generic drugs, with no evidence of an increased probability of seizures.', 'For none of the active substances studied, there was evidence of a lower efficacy of the generic medicinal product.', 'Based on the studies published so far, there is no evidence of inferiority of generic medicinal products compared to original medicinal products.']",0,"The sentences state that studies comparing generic and original epilepsy medications found no evidence of reduced efficacy in the generic versions.  
","Yes, the summarized results of clinical studies do not provide any evidence for a poorer efficacy of generics compared to originator drugs. However, comparative studies exist only for some agents against cardiovascular diseases and epilepsy."
Are animal-assisted therapies effective for mental illness?,"['The authors conclude from the data that animal assisted therapies may be effective in some diseases, including mental disorders and behavioural disorders such as depression, schizophrenia and addiction.', 'There is still no reliable data on the efficacy of animal-based therapy, for example in patients with cancer and advanced fatal diseases, in terms of state of health and quality of life.']",0,"While the authors suggest potential effectiveness for some mental disorders, the sentences also highlight a lack of reliable data regarding animal-assisted therapy's impact on mental illness.  
","Studies on the effects of animal-assisted therapies are only partially conclusive. It seems plausible that animal-assisted therapies can be supportive for some mental illnesses; however, very large or rapid effects are unlikely."
Can lack of sleep cause obesity?,"['So, most likely, lack of sleep is just one of many different factors that can affect weight gain.', 'Cause unclear The mere fact that people with a lack of sleep are more likely to be overweight or gain more weight than those who sleep, however, does not necessarily mean that the lack of sleep is the real cause of obesity.', 'People who sleep too little usually have an unhealthy lifestyle in general, so other factors can also play a role in increasing weight gain.', ""Whether lack of sleep actually makes you fat can't be said from previous study results – even if there is evidence that people who sleep little may become overweight rather than people with normal sleep.""]",1,"While the sentences note a correlation between lack of sleep and weight gain, they emphasize that other lifestyle factors and the lack of definitive causal evidence make it difficult to conclude that sleep deprivation directly causes obesity.  
",People who regularly get too little sleep may be more likely to be overweight than those who get enough sleep. But whether lack of sleep itself causes obesity is unclear.
Does copper intake increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease?,"[""Because there are no studies that associate an increased uptake of copper directly with an increased Alzheimer's risk [6].""]",1,"The provided sentence states there is a lack of studies linking increased copper intake to a higher risk of Alzheimer's disease.

Do air ions cause an improvement of asthma??,"['Compared to asthma patients who were exposed to dummy treatment, actual therapy with air ionization devices did not show any improvement in asthma symptoms or lung function.']",2,"The sentences state that air ionization devices did not improve asthma symptoms or lung function in patients compared to a placebo, directly contradicting the claim.  
","Whether ionized air can reduce allergic symptoms is unclear, as no studies exist on this question. Air ionization devices do not appear to be effective against asthma in general."
Do smoking bans lead to fewer preterm births?,"['Smoking bans mean that mothers smoke less in pregnancy and that unborn women are exposed to less passive smoke.', 'It is a methodically very good work, but there are some limitations to the statements: the results of the individual studies vary greatly, whether the real effect is really 10% each, will only be able to clarify future studies.']",0,"The sentences suggest that smoking bans could reduce preterm births by decreasing maternal smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke, but further research is needed to confirm the magnitude of the effect. 
","A large review shows a 10% reduced risk of preterm birth. Due to some limitations, the evidence is nevertheless low, further studies from different countries will probably soon bring clarity."
Do special garments with the active ingredient Liporeductyl help against cellulite?,"['An effect could not be found for any active substance [1].', 'Or, to put it more carefully, for none of the innumerable forms of treatment have well-derived scientific evidence that speaks for effectiveness.']",1,"The sentences state that no scientific evidence supports the effectiveness of any treatment for cellulite, including those with the active ingredient Liporeductyl.  
","There are only small studies that neither stand up to methodological criteria nor have been scientifically published. Sustained efficacy has not been proven, which, according to the current status, applies to all common remedies against cellulite."
Does alcohol in moderate amounts prolong life?,"['Alcohol: Beyond good and evil As described in our article on red wine, moderate alcohol consumption probably has a positive effect on cardiovascular health [2]; moderate means an alcoholic drink per day – a small beer or an eighth of wine.']",0,"The sentences suggest that moderate alcohol consumption, defined as one drink per day, may benefit cardiovascular health, which could potentially contribute to a longer lifespan.  
","In moderate amounts, alcohol could reduce the likelihood of dying prematurely. In higher doses, however, it clearly increases this risk. This is unclear for caffeine."
Does light freezing help with weight loss?,"['Much speculation, little knowledge A scientific work taken up by many media does not help with this question [1].', 'Nevertheless, weight loss was not significantly higher than after the same exercise program at more pleasant temperatures.']",1,"The sentences suggest that while light freezing is a popular topic, studies have not found it to lead to significantly greater weight loss compared to exercise at more comfortable temperatures.  
","Some laboratory studies show that the body reacts to colder temperatures with higher energy consumption and burns more fat. Nevertheless, it is completely unclear whether this supports weight loss; that is, whether the process is strong enough and whether other mechanisms do not work against it. Weight loss through freezing has not been investigated in clinical studies."
Does acupuncture help against hay fever?,"['As with other acupuncture studies, it is therefore questionable whether the improvement of hay fever symptoms was due to the needle stitches themselves.', 'In order to distinguish between the placebo effect and the specific effect of acupuncture in the future, further studies with better study designs are necessary.']",1,"The sentences express doubt about the effectiveness of acupuncture for hay fever due to the need for further research to differentiate its effects from placebo.  
",We have not found any meaningful studies that can provide evidence of improvement in hay fever.
"Does the ""Rolfing"" treatment cause an improvement of body malpositions as well as certain pains?","['Therefore, it cannot be automatically deduced from these results that the cause of the pain reduction lies in the Rolfing treatments.', 'Overall, the scientific evidence on the effectiveness of Rolfing technology for the treatment of pain or correction of body malpositions is insufficient.']",1,"The provided sentences state that the scientific evidence is insufficient to conclude that Rolfing treatments directly cause pain reduction or correction of body malpositions.

Does virgin conception exist?,"['Until now, fertilization without sexual contact – biologists refer to it as parthenogenesis – is only known from a few animal species.', 'In humans, the phenomenon is hardly researched, the present study is the only scientific study on this subject so far.']",1,"The sentences state that parthenogenesis, or fertilization without sexual contact, is rare in animals and that human research on this topic is limited.  
","To date, only one study has been conducted on this issue. The scientific evidence based on this study does not allow a clear answer."
Are movement exercises useful for back pain?,"['Targeted exercise to strengthen torso muscles should both relieve and prevent back pain.', 'As a systematic overview [1] shows, strengthening exercises can clearly prevent the recurrence of pain.', 'One of the results: Chronic cross pain (duration over twelve weeks) improves at least something when the sufferers perform regular exercise.']",0,"The sentences provide evidence that targeted exercises can both alleviate and prevent back pain, suggesting their potential usefulness.  
","Exercise reduces the risk of getting back pain again and can relieve chronic back pain somewhat. However, quick relief from acute pain is not to be expected."
Does UV light reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease?,"['The result: 20 minutes under artificial UVA light may reduce blood pressure slightly in the short term.', 'Whether regular UVA irradiation can also reduce blood pressure in the long term cannot be predicted from this, longer-term studies would be necessary.', 'Cardiovascular diseases vs. cancer Overall, the evidence for reducing the heart risk from sunbathing is still insufficient – only more extensive and more precise studies can give an answer.']",1,"While the sentences suggest a potential short-term effect of UVA light on blood pressure, they emphasize the need for further research to determine if this translates to long-term cardiovascular benefits.

Does removal and examination of the first lymph nodes after the prostate is affected by cancer (sentinel lymph nodes or sentinel lymph nodes) improve the chances of cure? (Reader Inquiry),"['In 2010, the claim that removal and examination of the guardian lymph nodes can reduce the risk of further metastases in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Another series of cases involving a little over 1000 patients [ 2 ] showed that in about two thirds of prostate cancer cases nodes were found infected with the guardian lymph node examination, which would have been disregarded at a conventional removal of most surrounding lymph nodes.']",1,"The sentences suggest that examining sentinel lymph nodes can identify cancer spread that might be missed with traditional lymph node removal, potentially impacting the chances of cure. 
","Removal and examination of sentinel lymph nodes helps assess the progression of prostate cancer. However, whether it improves the chances of cure cannot be said due to the low level of scientific evidence."
Can a treatment with singing bowls relieve pain?,"['The participants felt much more relaxed, calmer and better tuned both after the treatment and after the sham treatment.', 'An effect is therefore attributable solely to the placebo effect.']",2,"The sentences suggest that any perceived pain relief from singing bowls is likely due to a placebo effect, as relaxation and calmness were reported after both the real and sham treatments.

","Antioxidant and multivitamin supplements do not reduce the likelihood of dying prematurely from cancer, cardiovascular disease, or other causes. Taking beta-carotene and possibly vitamin E may actually increase the likelihood of premature death. The only exception is vitamin D supplements; they are likely to have a small life-prolonging effect in the elderly."
Is it true that lowering cholesterol does not reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease?,"['Study participants who consumed less salt and fat, but more fruits, vegetables and fiber, were able to lower their LDL cholesterol levels and blood pressure slightly.', 'Especially a Mediterranean diet with lots of fruits, vegetables, nuts, olive oil and fish as well as little red meat and dairy products seems to have a positive effect on heart health.', 'However, this does not mean that all cholesterol-lowering agents automatically reduce the cardiovascular risk.', 'Cholesterol only one of many heart risk factors Cholesterol is by no means the only factor that increases the likelihood of cardiovascular diseases such as heart attack or stroke.', 'Quitting smoking also significantly reduces the risk, even if it does not affect cholesterol levels.']",2,"While some lifestyle changes can lower cholesterol and benefit heart health, the sentences emphasize that cholesterol is just one factor among many that contribute to cardiovascular disease risk.  
","No. High cholesterol, along with other risk factors, can increase the likelihood of cardiovascular disease. If the proportion of ""bad"" LDL cholesterol in the blood is lowered (with medication or through a change in diet), the risk of diseases such as heart attack or stroke also decreases."

Do green tea products provide effective and safe support for weight loss?,"['This is too short to judge the long-term success of weight loss.', 'Overall, for the authors of this systematic survey, it remains questionable whether the investigated plant extracts can help with long-term weight loss and are also safe.', '[12] So there is no good evidence that at least the food supplements listed here can provide significant support in weight loss.']",2,"The sentences express doubt about the long-term effectiveness and safety of green tea products for weight loss, citing a lack of strong evidence.  
","Due to the number of studies, it is unclear for a number of supposedly appetite-suppressing dietary supplements whether they can support successful weight loss. Well-done studies that run over a long period of time with a sufficient number of test subjects are scarce. Evidence for long-term safety and simultaneous efficacy is therefore lacking."
Can monk's pepper help with cycle disorders?,"['The summarized study results indicate that the symptoms with monk pepper are reduced in more patients than with a sham medication (placebo).', 'However, these results are not well-secured.', 'Whether monk peppers can help with such cycle disorders is simply not researched meaningfully.', 'We could not find reliable studies that investigated this question (see studies in detail).', 'However, whether this can reduce the symptoms is not well studied [4].']",1,"While some studies suggest monk pepper might reduce symptoms, there is insufficient research to determine its effectiveness in treating cycle disorders.  
","In the studies to date, monk's pepper seems to relieve PMS symptoms better than a placebo. However, this is not well proven, because the studies have significant weaknesses. There is no evidence of an effect on menstrual disorders. Significant studies are lacking."
Does brisk walking lower mortality? Is some exercise better than none at all?,"['==References==<br> According to their calculations, 75 minutes of brisk walking a week can extend life by 1.8 years.', 'For participants with a movement time up to 75 minutes of brisk walking per week, mortality fell by around 20 percent – in the model calculation this corresponds to 1.8 years.', 'In both normal and overweight people, mortality decreased when the researchers compared slightly active (equivalent to approximately 140 minutes of brisk walking per week) with inactive people.']",0,"The sentences provide evidence that brisk walking, specifically 75 minutes per week, is associated with a lower mortality rate and a longer lifespan.  
","Several major studies have consistently concluded that physical activity reduces mortality. Even a brisk walk is enough. More helps more - but in any case, some exercise is much better than none at all."
Can arthroscopy reduce pain or improve mobility?,"['Studies clearly speak against a benefit A research team summarized the most meaningful of all previously published studies on arthroscopy in knee arthritis.', 'In these studies, patients treated after arthroscopy had no noticeably less pain or movement restrictions than those treated only for appearance or not at all.', 'Arthroscopy against osteoarthritis: not effective, but also not very risky After all: Undesirable events were not conspicuously common in the arthroscopy groups either.']",2,"The sentences state that studies found no significant difference in pain or mobility between patients who underwent arthroscopy and those who did not, directly contradicting the claim.  
",The data are clear: Arthroscopy is useless as a treatment for knee osteoarthritis. It can neither relieve pain nor improve the function of the knee joint in the long term.
Do health benefits increase with duration and intensity of exercise?,"['==References==<br> According to their calculations, 75 minutes of brisk walking a week can extend life by 1.8 years.', 'In both normal and overweight people, mortality decreased when the researchers compared slightly active (equivalent to approximately 140 minutes of brisk walking per week) with inactive people.', 'In this study, too, a gain in years of life was calculated, but here in relation to the time of birth: Compared to inactive people, slight activity prolongs life by 0.7 years.', '150 minutes of physical activity per week reduced mortality by around 9 percent.', 'less than 150 minutes per week, can reduce their risk of death by around 34% compared to inactive people.']",0,"The provided sentences demonstrate a correlation between increased physical activity, measured in minutes per week, and a reduced risk of mortality, supporting the idea that health benefits increase with exercise duration. 
","Several major studies have consistently concluded that physical activity reduces mortality. Even a brisk walk is enough. More helps more - but in any case, some exercise is much better than none at all."
