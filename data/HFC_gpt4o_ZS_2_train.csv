Does paxlovid protect unvaccinated people with risk factors from severe or even fatal covid 19 disease?,"['Patients at risk without corona vaccination appear to be well protected from serious to fatal events by Paxlovid.', 'However, it is not certain how well Paxlovid helps people who have already received corona vaccination.', 'In addition, the scientists investigated whether Paxlovid alleviated the Covid-19 symptoms, shortened the duration of the disease and reduced the need for medical treatment: Half of the participants improved the symptoms with Paxlovid after 13 days, with placebo after 15 days.', 'With Paxlovid, 14 out of 1000 participants needed medical treatment for Covid-19 within a month, with placebo 76 out of 1000.', 'Whether with or without antibodies in the blood, Paxlovid basically protected all humans from a severe course.']",0,"The sentences indicate that Paxlovid provides protection against severe outcomes for unvaccinated patients at risk, but do not clarify its effectiveness for vaccinated individuals, leaving uncertainty regarding the overall protective benefits of Paxlovid for the specified group in the claim.","In a large, well-done study, paxlovid prevented hospitalizations and deaths in high-risk patients. They were unvaccinated and had contracted the delta variant. For vaccinated people, the benefit cannot be reliably estimated. This also applies to people with immunodeficiency."
Does the consumption of soy foods or soy isoflavones affect the appearance of acne skin?,"['In both cases, certain soya ingredients are responsible for the effect on the skin: the isoflavones.', 'There are two competing theories that contradict each other: according to the first theory, isoflavones confuse the hormone balance and are supposed to promote acne in this way.', 'Surprisingly, despite searching in two large databases, we could not find a study on soy products and acne – whether soy milk, soy sauce or tofu.', 'The isoflavones improved the skin appearance more than an anti-acne cream with vitamin A acid (Tretinoin).', 'Conclusion: There is currently no evidence from reliable studies that soy makes acne worse.']",1,"The sentences indicate that while there are theories suggesting isoflavones may promote acne, there is no reliable evidence from studies to support that soy foods worsen acne, and in fact, isoflavones have been shown to improve skin appearance.","We could not find any meaningful studies at all on the influence of soy foods on acne. On soy isoflavones, we found two small studies of questionable quality that examined a very specific group of sufferers. Soy isoflavones improved the skin appearance somewhat. However, this result is not reliable."
Is the homeopathic remedy Neradin effective for erectile dysfunction?,"['No studies on Neradin Also our search for studies on the product Neradin remained resultless.', 'Studies on the product Neradin also appear to be missing.']",1,"The sentences indicate that there are no studies available on the homeopathic remedy Neradin, which suggests a lack of evidence to support its effectiveness for erectile dysfunction.","The extract from the Damiana plant (Turnera diffusa) is advertised as a remedy for erectile dysfunction for men. However, this claimed effect on potency is by no means proven. It has apparently never been tested on humans. This also applies to homeopathic remedies such as the product Neradin."
Does regular HPV testing in addition to the recommended Pap smear detect more precancerous lesions than just the Pap smear alone?,"['According to the studies, the HPV test is likely to detect slightly more precursors of cervical cancer over several years than the PAP swab alone.', 'We are therefore relatively sure that with an additional HPV test at least a little more precursors of uterine cancer are detected than only with the PAP swab alone.']",0,"The sentences indicate that studies suggest the HPV test detects more precursors of cervical cancer than the Pap smear alone, supporting the claim that regular HPV testing in addition to the Pap smear is more effective in detecting precancerous lesions.","Regular examination of the cervix by means of PAP smear tests detects precancerous stages of the cervix in most cases in good time. This reduces the risk of developing cervical cancer. An additional HPV test every three to five years can make screening even more reliable. However, the difference should not be too great."
Can monk's pepper reduce PMS symptoms? PMS is the abbreviation for premenstrual syndrome. This refers to complaints that occur in the days before menstruation.,"['Reference to efficacy in PMS According to previous studies, monk peppers could actually help in PMS.', 'The summarized study results indicate that the symptoms with monk pepper are reduced in more patients than with a sham medication (placebo).', 'Therefore, it would be possible for monk peppers to act against PMS symptoms such as breast spacing.']",0,"The provided sentences indicate that previous studies suggest monk pepper may help reduce PMS symptoms, implying a potential efficacy that aligns with the claim.","In the studies to date, monk's pepper seems to relieve PMS symptoms better than a placebo. However, this is not well proven, because the studies have significant weaknesses. There is no evidence of an effect on menstrual disorders. Significant studies are lacking."
Can olive leaf extract reduce high blood pressure?,"['These studies therefore do not indicate whether olive leaf extract can help with significantly increased blood pressure.', 'Without success, however, we could not find any studies that investigated the effect of olive leaf extract on cardiovascular health.', 'However, they cannot provide clear answers.', 'It is therefore impossible to say whether olive leaves extract could have a better or worse effect with significantly increased blood pressure.']",1,"The sentences indicate a lack of studies and clear evidence regarding the effect of olive leaf extract on high blood pressure, making it impossible to determine its potential benefits or drawbacks for this condition.","Whether olive leaf extract lowers blood pressure has been investigated in five suitable studies to date. They all found no effect or only a slight effect of the extract. The problem with this is that most of the study participants had only slightly elevated blood pressure. They cannot answer how olive leaf extract works in people with significantly elevated blood pressure (hypertension). The studies also had gross flaws, few participants, and ran for a very short time. They cannot provide reliable answers."
Do green-lipped mussel preparations improve the symptoms of osteoarthritis?,"['Studies overall not meaningful The conclusion of our research: Scientific evidence for the claimed effect is missing.', 'It is also unclear whether the measured positive effects are large enough to actually be felt by those affected.', 'Whether or not green-lipped mussel helps with osteoarthritis cannot be said at the moment.', 'However, as early as 2009, the European Food Safety Authority considered that a protective effect of the green-lipped mussel on healthy joints has not been established.', 'In our opinion, no reliable conclusions can be drawn from the studies found.']",1,"The sentences indicate a lack of scientific evidence supporting the effectiveness of green-lipped mussel preparations for improving osteoarthritis symptoms, highlighting uncertainty about their benefits and the absence of established protective effects.","The question was examined in four small studies with serious methodological deficiencies, which also arrived at partly contradictory results. No clear conclusions can be drawn from them. The claim that green-lipped mussel helps with osteoarthritis is not scientifically proven."
Can probiotics lower blood sugar in type 2 diabetes?,"['And if so, can probiotics reverse this change and reduce blood sugar levels again?', 'At the most small effect, they may actually be able to.', 'However, the effect of the capsules and tablets does not seem to be large: in the previous studies, they were able to reduce the long-term sugar level HbA1c by an average of 0.55 points.']",0,"The sentences suggest that while probiotics may have a small effect on reducing blood sugar levels in type 2 diabetes, the overall impact appears to be limited, indicating that they are unlikely to significantly lower blood sugar.","The summarized results of studies to date suggest that probiotics in capsule or tablet form could lower blood sugar somewhat. At least if they are taken over a period of two to three months. However, the effect is not well established. Probiotic dairy products and probiotic powder for dissolving do not seem to have any demonstrable effect."
Can the so-called Tupler technique help against rectus diastasis?,"['No studies on the Tupler technique As intense as we were looking for, we could not find the promised studies on the Tupler technique.', 'The claim that this is a scientifically proven therapy for rectus diastase is therefore simply wrong.', 'The studies in detail We did not find any studies that investigated the effectiveness of the Tupler technique for the treatment of rectus diastase.']",1,"The sentences indicate that there are no studies supporting the effectiveness of the Tupler technique for rectus diastasis, directly refuting the claim of its scientific validation.",We could not find a single study that examined whether the Tupler technique actually works. And this despite the fact that providers of the method advertise that its effectiveness is scientifically proven.
Can CBD (cannabidiol) help with migraines or other headaches?,"['Apparently, CBD has never been investigated to see if it can help with migraine seizures.', 'The claim that CBD would help with migraines or headaches is pure speculation.', 'The studies in detail Despite extensive search in three databases, we could not find any studies on CBD against migraine or other types of headache, neither for treatment nor for prevention.']",1,"The provided sentences indicate that there is no research supporting the effectiveness of CBD for migraines or headaches, suggesting that the claim lacks sufficient evidence.",There are no studies that have investigated the effectiveness of CBD against migraine. So claims that CBD can help with or prevent migraine attacks have no scientific basis. The same is true for other types of headache.
Can laser irradiation of blood by infusion needle (hemolaser treatment) relieve discomfort or help with diseases?,"['It is also unclear by what mechanism blood irradiation with bundled red light – i.e.', 'red laser – should improve health.', 'Although the authors of the three studies found [1-3] claim to have established a clear efficacy of haemolaser treatment, none of the three studies is suitable to prove this.']",1,"The sentences indicate that the mechanism by which hemolaser treatment could improve health is unclear and that the studies claiming its efficacy are not suitable for proving its effectiveness, suggesting insufficient evidence to support the claim.",There is no scientific evidence that hemolaser treatment has a palliative or curative effect on health problems.
Can CBD help with period pain?,"['Because despite searching in three different databases we could not find a single study on CBD in case of regular pain.', 'Scientifically, it is not sufficiently researched whether CBD actually promotes sleep, as providers claim.', 'The studies in detail We could not find any studies that investigated whether CBD can help with normal pain – neither for treatment nor for prevention.']",1,"The sentences indicate a lack of research on the effectiveness of CBD for pain relief, including period pain, suggesting that there is insufficient evidence to support the claim.",Whether CBD can relieve menstrual pain has apparently never been scientifically studied. We could not find any studies on this. Women who suffer from severe period pain should talk to a gynecologist about it. Diseases such as endometriosis could be behind it.
"Can a bioresonance device like ""Bioscan"" or ""Vieva Vital Analyser"" measure mineral and vitamin deficiencies or detect health problems?","['This experiment clearly shows that the devices studied are completely unsuitable to diagnose a lack of vitamins or minerals.', 'Sentenced for fraud at the end of May 2022, a German court also concluded that the Bioscan device cannot fulfil the claimed claims.', 'Claims for comparable products are equally implausible.', 'Even if 1000 subjects had participated in the study and only five to six people had shown such unreliable readings, such a device would be worthless for diagnostics.']",2,"The sentences indicate that devices like ""Bioscan"" and ""Vieva Vital Analyser"" have been deemed unsuitable for diagnosing vitamin and mineral deficiencies, with a court ruling against the validity of their claims.","An experiment shows that the devices cannot distinguish between healthy people, seriously ill people and a corpse. The claimed mode of action behind the measurement method is also scientifically implausible. A German court has convicted the manufacturers of the Bioscan device (not legally binding) of fraud."
Does arthroscopy (joint endoscopy) help with osteoarthritis of the knee joint?,"['What might sound logical, however, has a catch: the arthroscopy of osteoarthritis does nothing to the treated person.', 'Studies clearly speak against a benefit A research team summarized the most meaningful of all previously published studies on arthroscopy in knee arthritis.', 'In these studies, patients treated after arthroscopy had no noticeably less pain or movement restrictions than those treated only for appearance or not at all.', 'Arthroscopy against osteoarthritis: not effective, but also not very risky After all: Undesirable events were not conspicuously common in the arthroscopy groups either.']",2,"The sentences indicate that arthroscopy for osteoarthritis of the knee does not provide any significant benefits in terms of pain relief or improved movement, suggesting that the procedure is ineffective for this condition.",The data are clear: Arthroscopy is useless as a treatment for knee osteoarthritis. It can neither relieve pain nor improve the function of the knee joint in the long term.
"Do dietary supplements containing silicon (e.g. as ""organic silicon"" or silica) have health benefits?","['So far it is also completely unclear what role the element silicon plays in the human body at all [8].', 'We have researched: Previous studies do not provide any evidence that dietary supplements with silicon support bone build-up and thus protect older women from osteoporosis and bone fractures in old age [1,2].', 'There is no evidence that silicon improves the hair structure [3,4], strengthens the fingernails [4] or makes the skin more beautiful and elastic [4,6,7].', 'Also that silicon supports the formation of collagen and connective tissue is only a conjecture [8].', 'Conjectures without studies Neither we nor the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) [8] were able to find clinical studies on any other alleged health benefits of silicon.']",1,"The provided sentences indicate a lack of evidence supporting the health benefits of dietary supplements containing silicon, highlighting that previous studies have not demonstrated any positive effects on bone health, hair structure, nail strength, skin elasticity, or collagen formation.","There is no evidence so far that the additional intake of silicon can promote health. Also that it strengthens nails, skin and hair is an unsubstantiated claim. Moreover, it is unclear whether silicon plays any role at all in the body."
Can regular intake of cranberry juice or cranberry extract prevent recurrent cystitis in women?,"['The summarized results show that the regular intake of cranberry products could have a preventive effect.', 'There is also only evidence that cranberry products can prevent bladder inflammation for otherwise healthy women.', 'Overall, there is evidence of a possible preventive effect of cranberry.']",0,"The sentences indicate that while there is some evidence suggesting a preventive effect of cranberry products against bladder inflammation in otherwise healthy women, it does not definitively establish that regular intake can prevent recurrent cystitis specifically.","Women who repeatedly have to deal with bladder infections might become ill somewhat less frequently if they regularly take cranberry juice or extract. However, this is not well established. And it only applies to uncomplicated bladder infections in otherwise healthy women. Whether cranberry products help when cystitis is already present remains unclear. This has not yet been investigated in meaningful studies."
Will women who have recurrent bladder infections get rid of them faster if they take cranberry products only after the disease is already there???,"['There is also only evidence that cranberry products can prevent bladder inflammation for otherwise healthy women.', 'However, there does not seem to be any meaningful studies that have investigated this in women with recurrent bladder inflammation.', 'The preventive effect of cranberry in children, men and people with urinary catheters or certain diseases has not been studied.']",1,"The sentences indicate that while cranberry products may prevent bladder inflammation in healthy women, there is a lack of meaningful studies specifically addressing their effectiveness in treating recurrent bladder infections, leaving the claim unsubstantiated.","Women who repeatedly have to deal with bladder infections might become ill somewhat less frequently if they regularly take cranberry juice or extract.

Can extract from St. John's wort relieve the symptoms of depression? Is it similarly effective as drugs against depression (antidepressants)?,"[""St John's wort: effective in mild to moderate depression Probably yes."", ""In mild to moderate depression, St John's wort preparations probably work better than placebo."", ""St John's wort preparations are probably as good as antidepressants."", ""St. John's wort and antidepressants can relieve the discomfort, but the depression can probably not cure for good.""]",0,"The sentences indicate that St. John's wort is probably effective for mild to moderate depression and may work as well as antidepressants, suggesting it can relieve symptoms but not necessarily cure depression permanently.",St. John's wort is likely to relieve the symptoms of mild to moderate depression better than a placebo. It also appears to be similarly effective to approved medications for depression (antidepressants). St. John's wort preparations are generally better tolerated than antidepressants.
"Does the Zisano bracelet strengthen the immune system, increase endurance and performance or reduce fatigue?","['Whether such bracelets have an effect, for example whether they can actually increase physical performance or strengthen the immune system, has apparently never been investigated.', 'Bracelets for more performance: studies show ineffectiveness All five studies came to the same conclusion: the bracelets had no effect on the performance or well-being of the subjects.', 'A scientifically plausible explanation as to how exactly such bracelets should develop their effect remains to be found in their suppliers.', 'The studies in detail We could not find any studies on the Zisano bracelet or comparable bracelets with silicon chip.']",1,"The provided sentences indicate that there is no scientific evidence supporting the claim that the Zisano bracelet can strengthen the immune system, increase endurance and performance, or reduce fatigue, as studies have shown ineffectiveness and a lack of investigation into such effects.","The promised positive effects of the ""Powerband"" wristband on health and well-being have apparently not been scientifically studied. We could not find any studies on this. It is also unclear how the wristband is supposed to work in concrete terms. A scientifically plausible explanation is missing."
"Does microimmunotherapy improve symptoms of allergies, cancer, joint inflammation, autoimmune diseases, dementia or various viral infections?","['None of these studies are meaningful – because they are poorly carried out and the published data are incomplete.', 'They cannot give any indication of the benefits of microimmune therapy.', 'Entitled doubts Since microimmune therapy preparations are highly diluted as homeopathic agents, we have fundamental doubts about the method.']",1,"The sentences indicate that the studies on microimmunotherapy are poorly conducted and lack sufficient data, leading to doubts about its effectiveness for improving symptoms of allergies, cancer, joint inflammation, autoimmune diseases, dementia, or viral infections.","So far, studies seem to exist only on microimmunotherapy against hay fever and cancer. Their significance is far too low to conclude that the therapy is effective. We found no studies on other health problems. Thus, there is no proven benefit of microimmunotherapy for any disease."
Can ginkgo extract improve mental performance in dementia patients?,"['Dementia patients taking Ginkgo extract often seemed to perform better in thinking, memory, and concentration tasks than those who swallowed placebo preparations without an active substance [1.3].', 'Although the studies indicate that Ginkgo extract can help people with dementia, the significance of the individual studies is limited.']",0,"The sentences suggest that while there are indications of improved mental performance in dementia patients taking Ginkgo extract compared to those on placebo, the overall significance of the studies is limited, implying uncertainty about the effectiveness of Ginkgo extract.",Previous studies suggest that ginkgo extract can improve mental performance in dementia - but this is not well established. It is not possible to say exactly how large this effect is.
Does pine wood improve sleep?,"['So there is no indication that the pine wood improves sleep.', 'The importance of these laboratory measurements for the sleep of the participants is unclear – even if the researchers interpret them as positive effects of the circling bed.', 'Whether a pine bed actually improves sleep would have to study more rigorous studies carried out according to scientific criteria on significantly more subjects in the future.The studies in detail [1,2] Grote et al.']",1,"The sentences indicate that there is no clear evidence supporting the claim that pine wood improves sleep, suggesting the need for more rigorous studies to determine any potential effects.","So far, only one small study has investigated this question. However, the results of this study are not conclusive due to numerous deficiencies in the conduct of the study."
Do green-lipped mussel preparations improve the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis?,"['For us, therefore, this claim is not credible.', 'Whether green-lipped mussel helps with rheumatism or not, can therefore not be said for sure at the moment.', 'Whether the results can be transferred to other products or other dosages is unclear.', ""The studies are all badly done according to today's standard: so it is unclear how reliable the measurements of the treatment success are."", 'Whether rheumatism patients would still benefit from green-lipped mussel preparations remains unclear.']",1,"The sentences indicate that there is insufficient evidence to definitively support or refute the claim about green-lipped mussel preparations improving rheumatoid arthritis symptoms, highlighting uncertainties in study quality and applicability.","Five small studies provide no overall evidence of benefit from green-lipped mussel in rheumatism. However, the rheumatism treatment of the participants does not meet today's standards and the studies were very poorly conducted. Therefore, we cannot draw any reliable conclusions from these studies."
Does covid vaccination reduce the likelihood of getting long-lasting symptoms (long covid) in case of corona infection?,"['Long-Covid risk with low vaccination Two studies [1,2] suggest that the long-covid risk is likely to be lower if vaccinated twice: In one of these studies with Corona infected [1], twice vaccinated patients reported 40 to 50 percent less likely to be affected by Long Covid compared to non-vaccinated patients.', 'Results Two-fold Vaccinated people reported to be affected by long-covid symptoms only about half as often as non-vaccinated people.']",0,"The sentences indicate that vaccinated individuals are significantly less likely to experience long-covid symptoms compared to non-vaccinated individuals, suggesting that covid vaccination may reduce the likelihood of long-lasting symptoms after infection.","If twice-vaccinated people are infected, their risk of later being affected by Long Covid may be only half that of non-vaccinated people.

All available studies are small and of unclear quality. We could not say whether lysine protects against herpes or can alleviate it.
"Do hormonal contraceptives to swallow (the ""pill"") affect endurance performance in women?","['The conclusion of the work: Women taking the pill could actually have a minor disadvantage in sports.', 'Specifically, women with a pill may absorb less oxygen during training and are out of breath faster.', 'Possibly a slightly lower performance through the pill – to this conclusion also came another current overview work [2].']",0,"The sentences indicate that women taking hormonal contraceptives may experience a minor disadvantage in endurance performance due to reduced oxygen absorption during training, which directly addresses the claim about the impact of the pill on endurance performance in women.","Taking the pill could possibly impair endurance performance in sports somewhat. However, there are no indications of less muscle strength due to the pill. However, these - somewhat contradictory - findings are anything but certain.

Does taking probiotics during pregnancy and early life protect children from atopic dermatitis?,"['Protection in and after pregnancy The summarized results of previous studies show that probiotics may protect infants from neurodermatitis [1].', 'A recent study summary confirms previous results: For children whose mothers had taken several mixed probiotic strains, the preventive effect was even greater [4].', 'The fact that probiotics may have a preventive effect against the development of atopic eczema shows a meta-anlysis from 2012 [1].', 'According to the analysis, probiotics could reduce the risk of neurodermatitis by one fifth.']",0,"The sentences indicate that probiotics may have a protective effect against neurodermatitis and atopic eczema in infants, suggesting a potential benefit of taking probiotics during pregnancy and early life for reducing the risk of atopic dermatitis in children.","Current studies suggest that the intake of probiotics could counteract the development of atopic dermatitis. However, many questions about efficacy and intake remain unanswered."
Is Bulletproof Coffee recommended?,"['Conclusion Published studies with human subjects who have dealt with the subject of Bulletproof Coffee are not available.', 'It also lacks the basis to make statements about side effects and long-term safety of this food form.', 'Thus it should not be quite easy to make various effects dingfest.', 'Ingredients under the microscope We have not found any clinical studies on the effects of Bulletproof Coffee.', 'However, there are still various unexplained aspects around these references.']",1,The lack of published studies on Bulletproof Coffee and its effects on human subjects indicates that there is insufficient information to recommend it.,"Bulletproof coffee is high in caffeine and fat. Is the hip breakfast substitute a kind of fitness potion? Or is it even harmful? Because there have been no studies on this coffee blend with human test subjects, we cannot make any reliable statements."
Do apples help with smoking cessation?,"['However, it is open which ingredients of apples should take the pleasure of tormenting – scientific evidence for this claim is missing.', 'However, apples do not appear in this context and in evidence-based recommendations [a], at least not as an aid.', 'However, the effects are small, and whether the apple taste is responsible can only be speculated.', 'On the other hand, it is not researched whether the apple really takes the appetite for the cigarette.']",1,"The sentences indicate a lack of scientific evidence supporting the claim that apples help with smoking cessation, as they mention the absence of research and evidence-based recommendations regarding this potential benefit.",Apples contain numerous ingredients and rightly have the reputation of being a healthy snack. Whether they can help to give up cigarettes has not yet been investigated in studies.
Do products made from fenugreek seeds help you lose weight?,"['However, the results do not indicate that an extract of plant seeds could help to reduce weight.', 'It is therefore unclear whether fenugreek seeds are able to lower blood sugar both in the short term and over longer periods of time.', 'Therefore, it remains unclear to what extent fenugreek seeds can be helpful in weight loss.', 'Whether the Fenulife product helps with weight loss can by no means be demonstrated by a study carried out for only three days.', 'The result is sobering: no meaningful studies of high quality were found.']",1,"The sentences indicate a lack of conclusive evidence regarding the effectiveness of fenugreek seeds for weight loss, highlighting uncertainty and insufficient quality studies to support the claim.","We found only one study in which participants had not lost weight after six weeks. However, the study period is very short, the number of participants small and the quality mediocre. It therefore remains unclear whether fenugreek seeds can help lose weight in the longer term."
Does skipping breakfast increase heart attack risk?,"['Obviously, therefore, the main reason for the increased risk of heart attacks was not to skip the morning meal, but overweight, diabetes, increased blood pressure, or too high cholesterol levels.', 'Thus, it is unclear whether the omission of breakfast leads to overweight or excess weight leads to the omission of breakfast.']",1,"The sentences suggest that factors like overweight and diabetes are more significant contributors to heart attack risk than skipping breakfast, indicating that the relationship between breakfast omission and heart attack risk is not clearly established.","There is no clear evidence that not eating breakfast could be a cause of obesity and, as a consequence, an increased risk of heart attack. It is possible, however, that it is primarily those people who are overweight and have a higher heart risk who forgo their morning meal."
Does wheat make you fat and sick?,"['But even if all of these mechanisms were correctly described, this does not necessarily mean that wheat makes you sick – the interplay of all mechanisms is not known.', 'Thus, the reduction of excess weight leads to health improvements, not the elimination of wheat.']",1,"The sentences indicate that the relationship between wheat and health is not clearly established, suggesting that wheat's role in causing sickness or weight gain is uncertain.",There is no evidence in current studies that wheat has a special connection with obesity and its consequences. Attributing a special role to wheat seems implausible.
Do whole grains lower the likelihood of dying early?,"['Against cancer, heart problems and diabetes The current study situation shows something else: Those who frequently resort to whole grains get less cancer or cardiovascular diseases, for example a heart attack [1–4].', 'Thus, people in whom whole grains play a major role in their daily diet seem to live longer and healthier.', 'All four summaries come to the same conclusion: They show a clear correlation between a full-grain diet and a reduced chance of dying early.', 'At least as far as the reduced risk of disease is concerned, the data show a robust dose-effect relationship: the more whole grains are eaten, the lower the risk of disease [6].']",0,"The sentences indicate a correlation between the consumption of whole grains and a reduced risk of diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular issues, suggesting that a diet rich in whole grains may contribute to a longer and healthier life, which supports the claim about lowering the likelihood of dying early.",People who eat whole grain products instead of foods made from refined flour are likely to live longer and probably have a lower risk of dying from cancer or cardiovascular disease.
"Does the consumption of dairy products promote mucus and diseases of the ear, nose and throat?","['No correlation between milk consumption and laboratory values The results of studies published so far in a systematic review do not indicate that high milk consumption increases inflammation levels in the blood.', ""However, the fact that the long-standing popular belief that cow's milk has a smearing effect is not likely to be confirmed by this, according to current knowledge.""]",1,"The provided sentences indicate that current studies do not support the idea that dairy consumption increases inflammation or has a smearing effect, which suggests that the claim about dairy promoting mucus and related diseases lacks sufficient evidence.",There is no scientific evidence to prove that cow's milk causes mucus.
Do light drinks promote obesity?,"['However, the fact that sweeteners actually affect blood sugar and insulin levels has not been proven.', 'The largest work, a summary analysis of three studies involving a total of 125,000 participants [7], comes to the opposite conclusion – light drinks should therefore reduce the weight slightly.', 'No scientific evidence whether artificially sweetened lemonades promote the development of overweight is therefore not yet available.']",1,"The sentences indicate that there is no conclusive evidence supporting the idea that light drinks promote obesity, as studies suggest they may even lead to slight weight reduction.","Several cohort studies show that people who frequently drink light drinks are more likely to be overweight. However, this does not prove that sweetener drinks make you fat. For it is equally conceivable that overweight people try to lose weight with light drinks. Whether they are successful in doing so is unclear."
Does coffee reduce the risk of dementia?,"['Scientists from Finland even want to find out that regular coffee drinking may also keep the brain fresh in the long term, in which it protects against dementia [1] [2].', 'And in fact, the scientists were able to establish a positive connection, but this effect seems to be above all a question of the coffee dose: the mental decline occurred most rarely during the course of the study in people who drank an average of one or two cups a day.', 'From the data from a total of eleven individual studies, the scientists concluded that people who consume a lot of caffeine had a reduced risk of dementia by about one-sixth (16%).', 'Further studies are necessary There are indications that people who drink a moderate amount of coffee daily are less at risk of developing cognitive disorders in the long term.']",0,"The sentences suggest a potential link between regular coffee consumption and a reduced risk of dementia, indicating that moderate coffee drinkers may experience less cognitive decline, but further research is needed to confirm these findings.",One to two cups of coffee a day may protect against mental decline in the long term. It should not be more than that. It is unclear where this effect comes from and whether other caffeinated beverages might also be protective.
Does sugar consumption increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes regardless of obesity?,"['Soft drinks increase the risk of diabetes People with a preference for large amounts of sugar-containing sodas also suffer more frequently from diabetes.', 'In their analyses, two research teams [1,2] were able to independently show that the more sugar the study participants consume in the form of soft drinks, the higher the probability of developing type 2 diabetes.', 'It seems that daily consumption of sugared soft drinks can trigger diabetes over many years even if it does not make you fat.', 'Sugar content of other foods with unclear influence The association with type 2 diabetes is relatively clear for soft drinks.']",0,"The sentences indicate that high sugar consumption from soft drinks is associated with an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, even in the absence of obesity, suggesting a direct link between sugar intake and diabetes risk.","Sugar-containing soft drinks can - if consumed regularly - cause obesity. Obesity, in turn, increases the likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes. However, sugared soft drinks probably also increase the risk of diabetes independently of obesity."
Does a lower salt diet reduce the likelihood of cardiovascular disease?,"['Whether the many salt in the food was really the reason for cardiovascular diseases, however, cannot be unquestionably clarified.', 'The result: a low-salt diet seems to be able to actually reduce the likelihood of cardiovascular diseases.', 'Those who reduce their salt consumption can reduce blood pressure in the medium term.', 'Lowering the risk of consequential diseases caused by high blood pressure can help a diet that is poorer in salt.']",0,"The sentences indicate that a low-salt diet can reduce blood pressure and potentially lower the risk of cardiovascular diseases, suggesting a positive relationship between reduced salt intake and cardiovascular health.","A lower-salt diet has been shown to help reduce elevated blood pressure somewhat. It is possible, but not certain, that this reduces the likelihood of dying from a stroke or the consequences of narrowed heart vessels, such as a heart attack."
Is less eaten from red plates?,"['The result: The test subjects who were served their pretzels on red plates accessed significantly less than participants with blue or white plates.', 'In a second experiment, subjects also drank soft drinks in a larger amount of blue instead of red cups.', 'As logical as this explanation may sound, the study does not yet provide scientific evidence that red plates really eat less.', 'In both salty and sweet snacks, the participants gained less when they were lying on a red plate in front of them.']",0,"The sentences indicate that while there are observations of less consumption from red plates compared to other colors, the study does not provide definitive scientific evidence to support the claim that red plates lead to less eating.","In two psychological experiments, participants were less likely to eat salty pretzels, popcorn or chocolate chips if they were served on red plates. It is unclear whether the effect lasts over a longer period of time."
Does red wine protect better against cardiovascular disease than white wine?,"['However, they usually did not distinguish between white and red wine [1] [2] [3].', 'It can therefore not be proven that red wine protects particularly well against cardiovascular diseases.', 'Thus, people who consume small amounts of alcohol daily seem to have a lower cardiovascular risk and live a little longer than strict non-drinkers [1] [2] [3] [4].', 'The result: For a moderate dose of eight to ten grams of pure alcohol per day, the overall mortality and risk of cardiovascular disease were lower than for non- or minor drinkers.', 'The impact of the studies is limited Even if people who eat a glass of wine or beer daily live longer and healthier, this does not necessarily mean that alcoholic beverages are responsible.']",1,"The sentences indicate that while moderate alcohol consumption may be associated with lower cardiovascular risk, they do not provide evidence that red wine specifically offers better protection against cardiovascular disease compared to white wine.","There is evidence that moderate amounts of alcohol may protect against cardiovascular disease, but the effect is not well established. Whether this possibly protective effect is stronger with red wine than with white wine or other alcoholic beverages has not been sufficiently investigated."
Do azo food dyes cause attention deficit disorder and hyperactivity in children?,"['Since 2010, the EU has committed manufacturers to label food with azo dyes ""May affect the activity and attention of children"".', 'However, the summarized results of these and other previously published studies provide clear evidence that artificial food colours can cause attention and hyperactivity disorder (ADHS).', 'Although the bright-colored dyes could be a partial cause of ADHD, there are certainly many other unknown triggers [5].', 'The studies in detail The fact that azo dyes could be responsible for behavioural abnormalities of children suggests a clean summary of previous studies [2].', 'Compared to children who continued to consume azo dyes, behavioural abnormalities decreased slightly.']",0,"The sentences indicate that while there is some evidence suggesting a link between azo food dyes and behavioral issues in children, they also acknowledge the presence of other potential triggers and do not definitively establish a causal relationship between azo dyes and attention deficit disorder or hyperactivity.",Some studies fuel the suspicion that azo dyes can exacerbate ADHD symptoms.
Does turmeric prevent or cure cancer?,"['However, well-executed studies of this kind have so far been scarce.', 'After 6 months of administration, the values did not differ between turmeric and dummy subjects.', 'This makes it unclear whether any improvement observed is due to turmeric treatment or whether the health status of the study participants would have improved without turmeric.']",1,"The sentences indicate a lack of sufficient evidence from well-executed studies to determine whether turmeric has any effect on preventing or curing cancer, as improvements could be attributed to other factors.",Animal studies provide tentative evidence that turmeric can prevent or treat cancer. Whether turmeric has such an effect in humans cannot be assessed due to the low confidence level of a few studies conducted to date.
Does breastfeeding reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome?,"['The scientists conclude that the risk of breastfed children is halved compared to un breastfed children [2].', 'However, the matter has a small catch: the studies analysed show a connection.', 'The studies in detail The fact that breastfeeding reduces the risk of unexpected death of a baby is only moderately secure.', 'However, this does not necessarily prove that breastfeeding is the reason for the lower risk of infant death.']",0,"The sentences indicate that while there is a connection between breastfeeding and a reduced risk of sudden infant death syndrome, the evidence is not strong enough to definitively establish breastfeeding as the cause of this lower risk.","Breastfeeding can possibly reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome, but this is not entirely certain. Other factors can also reduce the risk."
"Do boron preparations such as borax, boric acid, or calcium fructoborate relieve pain associated with age-related joint wear (osteoarthritis)?","['Even if their authors want to give a positive impression in their work – a critical look at the data shows that the Borax tablets could not alleviate arthrosis complaints among the participants.', 'There is no evidence that borax or boric acid can actually improve the discomfort in people with worn joints.', 'Those who suffer from chronic osteoarthritis pains and stiff joints and are hoping for relief through Borax should rely on more effective alternatives.']",1,"The sentences indicate that boron preparations like borax and boric acid do not alleviate pain associated with osteoarthritis, as they lack evidence of effectiveness in improving discomfort for those with joint wear.","The few studies on this are of poor quality and therefore not trustworthy. Moreover, there is no evidence that the human body needs boron at all."
Does the Orthopulse device accelerate the orthodontic correction of malocclusions?,"['Little meaningful The three published studies [1-3] cannot convince: None of the studies actually investigates the entire duration of treatment, but only the speed of tooth movements in the correction phase of brace therapy.', 'This does not make any sure statements about the reduction of the overall duration of treatment with which the manufacturer advertises.', 'Theoretically, two effects of orthopulses would be conceivable: positive effects if the duration of treatment were shortened, or negative effects if conversion processes at the tooth root were accelerated.', 'Thus, it is also questionable whether the faster treatment with the orthopulse device actually results from infrared therapy: In the control group, the teeth move on average by 0.44 mm per week, in the group with the orthopulse device on average by 1.27 mm per week.']",1,"The sentences indicate that while the Orthopulse device may show increased speed of tooth movement during the correction phase, there is insufficient evidence to confirm that it reduces the overall duration of orthodontic treatment, leaving the claim unverified.",Poorly done studies show that the device can accelerate tooth movement in the short term. Whether this reduces the overall treatment time has not yet been sufficiently proven. The methodological weaknesses of the studies also mean that the results are not very credible. Possible side effects have not yet been sufficiently investigated.
Is it harmful for the mental development of the unborn child if the mother regularly eats fish contaminated with mercury during pregnancy?,"['For previous studies suggest that the consumption of larger amounts of mercury-containing fish could slightly affect the mental performance of the offspring [1, 2, 3].', 'The studies in detail The fact that methyl mercury can damage the brain of unborn children already in concentrations in which the pregnant mothers themselves do not notice any symptoms is beyond question [6].', 'In investigations into the Faroe Islands and New Zealand, the assumption was confirmed: expectant mothers with high mercury levels were given children, whose mental performance was on average slightly worse in later tests than that of unloaded mothers – the mercury levels of the mothers were mostly so high, because they had consumed large amounts of contaminated fish before and during pregnancy.', 'Impact on the IQ Despite these contradictions, the consumption of contaminated fish seems to reduce the intelligence of the offspring measurable, although it is not yet clear how much.', ""A research team at Harvard University calculated an average reduction in the intelligence ratio of 0.7 points for each micrograms of mercury in mother's hair [2] in the analysis of studies from the Faroe Islands, Seychelles and New Zealand.""]",0,"The provided sentences indicate that consumption of mercury-contaminated fish during pregnancy can negatively impact the mental development of the unborn child, as evidenced by studies showing a correlation between high mercury levels in mothers and lower mental performance in their children.","Many commercially available types of edible fish are contaminated with traces of methyl mercury. There are indications that regular consumption of such mercury-containing fish during pregnancy can impair the brain development of unborn children and thus their later mental abilities. In contrast, consumption of fish low in mercury could promote brain development in the unborn."
Can the consumption of caffeine during pregnancy harm the unborn child?,"['However, the study showed that it made no difference whether the participants drank around three cups of caffeine or decaffeinated coffee.', ""On average, the weight of birth at birth was about the same, was similar in size and was not more frequently born too early even after the mother's caffeine consumption."", 'Similar to the summary of the Cochrane overview work: In early pregnancy three cups of coffee daily would have no effect on birth weight, growth or premature birth [2].']",1,"The provided sentences indicate that caffeine consumption during pregnancy does not significantly affect birth weight, growth, or the likelihood of premature birth, suggesting that it may not harm the unborn child.",There is insufficient evidence that moderate consumption of caffeinated beverages would have a negative impact on the child's development. Up to three cups of coffee a day does not appear to reduce the child's birth weight. Very large amounts of caffeine-containing beverages could possibly contribute to lower birth weight.
Are vegetables prepared in a microwave oven less healthy than those prepared in other ways?,"['Recent studies see the matter more differentiated: Depending on the variety of vegetables and the exact type of preparation, the microwave can sometimes be better and sometimes worse suited than, for example, cooking [2-12].', 'In the worst case, if it is exaggerated with the duration and the number of watts, the corresponding food is less health-promoting, but in no way harmful to health.', 'If there are health problems related to the microwave, then this is not because the microwave ingredients are destroyed or changed, but because it is simply too unhealthy to eat altogether.', 'The week-long feeding with always several times warmed up in the microwave has not led to any signs of poisoning in the animals.']",2,"The sentences indicate that the healthiness of vegetables prepared in a microwave can vary depending on the type of vegetable and preparation method, suggesting that microwaving is not inherently less healthy than other cooking methods.","How vegetables change during preparation is extremely variable. With any type of heating, ingredients can be lost or become more easily accessible. In sum, it cannot be said that preparation in the microwave is always a bad choice."
Can fructose damage the liver?,"['Fruit sugar as a cause not proven There are no meaningful indications for the assumption that fruit sugar is responsible for the development of the liver disease [1].', 'In other words, for the liver, it may not matter what kind of sugar you eat.']",1,"The sentences indicate that there is no proven link between fructose and liver disease, suggesting that the type of sugar consumed may not significantly impact liver health.",There is no conclusive evidence for a possible liver-damaging effect of fructose.
Can green tea affect the likelihood of dying early and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease?,"['In fact, the summarized results of observational studies show that passionate green tea drinkers live longer on average – apparently because they are less likely to die from cardiovascular diseases such as heart attack [2,3].', ""However, a 100% proven cause-effect relationship à la ‘Green tea use protects against stroke, heart attack and co' cannot be derived from these observational studies."", 'We do not know exactly what the substances from the green tea in our body do – and what amounts can trigger a positive health effect.', 'Overall, the study data show that passionate green tea drinkers are less likely to die from cardiovascular diseases and thus live longer overall.', 'Seven RCTs are summarized here, and the authors concluded that green tea as a beverage or dietary supplement may have a beneficial influence on the risk factors of blood pressure, total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol.']",0,"The sentences indicate that while passionate green tea drinkers may have a lower likelihood of dying from cardiovascular diseases and potentially live longer, the evidence from observational studies does not establish a definitive cause-effect relationship between green tea consumption and reduced early mortality or cardiovascular risk.","There is a lack of conclusive studies on the health effects of specific matcha. However, there is some evidence that green tea in general may reduce the likelihood of dying prematurely, especially from cardiovascular disease."
Can acupuncture prevent migraines and tension headaches?,"['Acupuncture works... From chronic migraines or tension headaches Affected patients get significantly rare headache attacks when they not only take conventional medication, but also undergo prophylactic acupuncture treatment.', '...but as good as migraine medications Another point suggests that acupuncture has a valuable prophylactic effect – at least for migraine sufferers: Further studies showed that acupuncture can only partially prevent migraine attacks, but at least as well as common medications [1].']",0,"The sentences indicate that while acupuncture may reduce the frequency of migraine attacks and has a prophylactic effect, it does not conclusively prevent migraines or tension headaches, suggesting that the claim is not fully supported.","In the case of migraine, the preventive effect of acupuncture is probably similar to that of prophylactic medication. However, for both migraine and tension headaches, acupuncture performs only slightly better than sham acupuncture. Whether the pricking of traditional acupuncture points plays a role is unclear."
Can green tea reduce the likelihood of dying from cancer ?,"['In some studies, there was indeed a slightly reduced probability of disease, but other studies even suggested an increased risk of cancer from the use of green tea.', 'The result provides sobering clarity: people who regularly drink large amounts of green tea die in sum as often at some kind of cancer as people who hardly touch green tea [8].', 'To a degree harmless Although the benefits of green tea against cancer are questionable, there is no evidence of a health-impairing effect in moderate consumption of some cups a day [2].']",2,"The sentences indicate that while some studies suggest a slight reduction in cancer risk associated with green tea, others show no benefit or even an increased risk, leading to uncertainty about its impact on cancer mortality.",The results of previous studies suggest that green tea cannot reduce the risk of dying from cancer.
Can plant sterols or foods with them reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease?,"['However, it is unclear whether the intake of such high amounts of plant sterols – e.g.', 'Whether these results are a coincidence or whether the higher rate of cardiovascular problems are actually due to plant sterols and not to other causes is unclear.', 'Cholesterol is also different Whether plant sterols can actually reduce not only LDL cholesterol levels, but also the risk of cardiovascular diseases, has not been investigated in a single clinical study.']",1,"The sentences indicate uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of plant sterols in reducing cardiovascular disease risk, highlighting a lack of conclusive evidence and the possibility of other contributing factors.","Plant sterols do lower cholesterol levels. However, whether they also reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease has not been researched.

Can too much iodine cause autoimmune thyroid disease and consequently hypothyroidism?,"['Individual studies suggest that too large amounts of iodine may be responsible.', 'Probably a variety of causes These study results suggest that Hashimoto disease is more likely to occur in people with particularly high iodine consumption.', 'However, large amounts of iodine may cause serious disturbances in people with potentially undetected thyroid problems [8].', 'The studies in detail Whether large amounts of iodine can actually cause inflammation of the thyroid gland by an overreacting immune system is not well protected.', 'The result: the higher the iodine intake in a region, the greater the proportion of residents who suffer from autoimmune thyroid inflammation.']",0,"The sentences indicate a correlation between high iodine consumption and the occurrence of autoimmune thyroid disease, suggesting that excessive iodine may contribute to hypothyroidism in individuals with underlying thyroid issues.",Autoimmune thyroid disease appears to occur more frequently in individuals with high iodine consumption. Whether high levels of iodine actually cause this disease has not been conclusively determined.
Does coffee affect cancer death risk?,"['Both studies concluded that coffee consumption has no effect on cancer mortality.', 'In other words, coffee generally does not seem to favor or prevent death through cancer.', 'For breast cancer, prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer and bladder cancer there seems to be no association with the consumption of coffee.', 'Conclusion: Coffee consumption does not seem to affect cancer mortality.', 'They did not detect any influence of coffee on the number of cancer deaths.']",2,"The sentences collectively indicate that coffee consumption does not influence cancer mortality, directly addressing the claim about its effect on cancer death risk.",Current evidence suggests that coffee consumption in general is neither protective nor detrimental to cancer death risk.
Do diets with primarily or exclusively uncooked foods have health benefits?,"['Whether raw food followers suffer a heart attack or stroke less often, need less medication or live longer overall, can not be derived from this.', 'Conclusion A health benefit of raw food, which goes beyond an increased consumption of vegetable foods, has not been conclusively proven.', 'Rather, there are indications that strict raw food diets may also have a negative impact on health – similar to other diets that severely restrict food selection.']",1,"The sentences indicate that while there is no conclusive evidence supporting health benefits from raw food diets, there are also concerns about potential negative health impacts, suggesting that the claim lacks sufficient support.","In studies, we have not been able to find convincing evidence that raw foods provide health benefits over healthy diets that include cooked foods.

Do irradiations with cold red light help with chronic gingivitis?,"['Few studies, no effect The few studies published so far indicate, however, that cold red light cannot effectively relieve such inflammations [1] [2] [3].', 'The fact that cold red light is intended to reduce pain after dental surgery can also not prove previous research results [4].', 'In none of these, the participating researchers were able to find an additional benefit of cold red light irradiation for the usual periodontitis treatment.', 'The summary analysis of existing studies does not indicate that cold red light can alleviate the consequences of dental surgery.']",2,"The provided sentences indicate that multiple studies have found no effective relief from chronic gingivitis through cold red light irradiation, suggesting that the claim is not supported by the existing research.",Previous studies indicate that chronic gingivitis and inflammation after dental surgery do not improve with irradiation with cold red light.
Does the Aspire system help you lose weight?,"['Whether this system leads to the desired weight loss, however, can not be said for sure at the present time.', 'However, it points to a strong effect: the study participants with the Aspire system lost an average of 21 kilograms in the first year, the comparison group only about 6 kilograms [1].', 'Patients with Aspire decreased an average of 21 kilograms in the first year, compared with about 6 kilograms in the comparative group.']",0,"The sentences indicate that while the Aspire system has shown significant weight loss in participants, it is uncertain if this outcome can be definitively attributed to the system itself.","Although there is only one small study on this, it shows a very large effect - which indicates that it is effective."
Does bisphenol A trigger allergies?,"['Hormone-like substances on the pill For BPA, the evidence of an allergy-promoting effect is currently not very strong.', 'The same study, which showed no correlation between the once measured BPA value in urine and existing allergies, found such association with the triclosan concentration in urine [2].']",1,"The sentences indicate that the evidence for bisphenol A promoting allergies is weak and that a study found no correlation between BPA levels in urine and existing allergies, suggesting insufficient support for the claim.","Individual observational studies suggest an association between bisphenol A intake and the development of asthma, but not allergy, in early childhood. Asthma is often the consequence of allergy. However, the measurement of bisphenol A intake in these studies is too imprecise for a clear statement."
Can maggots accelerate the healing of chronic wounds compared to conventional treatment?,"['Although the thorough cleansing of the wound is important for the healing process [2], there seems to be no indication that wounds heal faster after the maggot treatment [1].', 'Twelve months after the start of treatment, the number of subjects with healed chronic wounds in the maggot group was no greater than in patients with hydrogel associations.']",2,"The sentences indicate that maggot treatment does not lead to faster healing of chronic wounds compared to conventional methods, as evidenced by the lack of difference in healing rates between the maggot group and those receiving hydrogel treatment.","Maggot therapy may not heal chronic wounds any faster than conventional wound care. However, the maggots seem to be able to clean the wound of dead tissue more quickly - but also cause more pain."
Do electric toothbrushes protect oral health better than manual brushes?,"['After a thorough analysis of all the results, they have come to a clear conclusion: Yes, electric toothbrushes are actually better for oral hygiene – but the difference is not large [1].', 'The electric oral cleaning thus removes a trace better than hand toothbrushes.', 'If you brush your teeth electrically, you will also get a little less gingival inflammation than people who brush manually, according to the results of the analyzed studies.', 'The advantage of electric toothbrushes compared to conventional toothbrushes is small.']",0,"The sentences indicate that while electric toothbrushes are somewhat better for oral hygiene than manual brushes, the difference in effectiveness is minimal, suggesting that the claim is not strongly supported.",Electric toothbrushes probably combat plaque and bleeding gums slightly better than conventional manual toothbrushes. The type of electric brush does not seem to play a major role.
Do antidepressants from the group of serotonin reuptake inhibitors help with depression?,"['Even if not all questions have been finally clarified around the SSRI group, the current study situation has revealed the following: SSRIs are effective.', ""SSRIs are not ‘happy pills', the effects achieved are rather moderate."", 'SSRI can be helpful in severe and probably also moderate depression.', 'In fact, the study situation with SSRI, as measured by its wide spread, was rather modest over a long period of time.']",0,"The sentences indicate that while SSRIs are effective and can be helpful for severe and moderate depression, their effects are described as moderate and the overall study situation has been modest, suggesting that the claim about their effectiveness in treating depression is not fully supported.","Serotonin reuptake inhibitors have been shown to be helpful in more severe depression, although the exact mechanisms are not clear. Overall, very strong or rapid effects are not expected. For milder depression, efficacy is more debatable. Sometimes patients have to try several SSRI preparations until they feel an improvement in symptoms, and some sufferers are not helped by the drugs at all. Well-done studies should help clarify the situation in the future so that more targeted treatment is possible."
Is there a health risk from metal contaminants in lipsticks?,"['Risk in individual cases unclear The cited study by the team led by study leader Liu [1] analysed 32 products on their metal content.', 'The small amounts of lipstick thus do not lead to an increased risk of poisoning.', 'If the use of lipsticks is therefore a health risk when used very frequently, only more detailed and extensive studies can show.']",1,"The sentences indicate that while there is uncertainty regarding the health risks of metal contaminants in lipsticks, the current evidence suggests that small amounts do not lead to an increased risk of poisoning, highlighting the need for further research to determine any potential health risks from frequent use.","Several chemical analyses find traces of metals in lipsticks, which can in principle be harmful in high concentrations. However, the analyses do not examine the quantities in which the metals are actually absorbed and whether they cause damage in the body. Overall, there is still too little research into whether there could be a risk for some of the metal impurities if they are used very frequently."
Can topiramate reduce the frequency of migraine attacks?,"['The authors summarized the results of 17 studies and found that the number of headaches actually decreases – but only by one in 28 days.', '[1] The overview also shows positive effects on the overall quality of life, but only to a small extent and not quite without contradiction.', 'Although all studies go in the same direction and indicate the effectiveness of topiramate, despite the review work of Cochrane Collaboration, the evidence is low, also because there are other criticisms: The authors have several conflicts of interest and it is possible that studies with poor results have not been published (publication bias).', 'Little knowledge about chronic migraine In the expert recommendation on therapy and care for chronic migraine, two small studies are mentioned, according to which topiramate can also prevent in chronic migraine attacks [2].']",0,"The sentences indicate that while topiramate may reduce the frequency of migraine attacks, the evidence supporting its effectiveness is low and accompanied by potential biases, suggesting that the claim is not definitively supported.","Possibly yes. A review by the Cochrane Collaboration attests that topiramate slightly reduces the frequency of migraine attacks in adults, and in some patients the attacks even decrease significantly. Still, there are unanswered questions and the side effects should not be underestimated."
Does particulate matter pollution increase the risk of heart attack - even if the EU limits are complied with?,"['The study of over 367,000 adults from 13 European countries indicates that long-term exposure to particulate matter generally increases the risk of mortality – meaning life-saving [1].', ""The authors reported that long-term exposure to particulate matter at the place of residence makes the occurrence of heart attack and unstable angina pectoris ('heart', a sign of an imminent heart attack) more likely."", 'An English cohort study from 2013 could not deduce a link between heart attack risk and fine dust air pollution, but fine dust exposure increased the risks of other heart diseases.', 'The short-term inhalation of larger amounts of fine dust may also make a heart attack more likely.']",0,"The sentences indicate that long-term exposure to particulate matter is associated with an increased risk of heart attack, suggesting that even when EU limits are met, there may still be a heightened risk.","Recent studies from Europe indicate that everyday exposure to particulate matter may increase the risk of acute heart disease (myocardial infarction, angina pectoris). General mortality may also be increased already by 'allowed' long-term exposure within the current EU limits."
Are endocrine disruptors in cosmetics a health risk?,"['Thus, the risk for parabens is not demonstrated by clinical studies, especially not by cosmetics.', 'Many chemicals are not researched at all, the interaction with certain diseases is unknown and it is also not sufficiently clear when and how endocrine disruptors intervene in the physical development of adolescents [b].', 'Humans are therefore exposed to many such influences, which makes risk assessment very difficult.']",1,"The sentences indicate that while there is a lack of clinical studies demonstrating the risk of parabens in cosmetics, there is also uncertainty regarding the effects of many chemicals, making it difficult to assess the health risks posed by endocrine disruptors.","Although many cosmetics do indeed contain substances that can influence the hormone system, a health risk has not been proven. Ecological consequences, on the other hand, have already been demonstrated."
"Can a dietary supplement containing omega-3 fatty acids, lipids, vitamins, and nutrients (""Souvenaid"") noticeably slow or halt the decline of mental performance in Alzheimer's disease?","['A comparison of the test values of the product and placebo groups with the end of the study shows no noticeable difference in the memory performance of the participants.', ""Two randomised-controlled studies for six to twelve months [4] and a third randomised-controlled study for 18 months [5] show that omega-3 fat-containing fish oil capsules cannot improve mental capacity in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease."", ""Whether one can prevent or delay the outbreak of Alzheimer's disease, if one regularly eats fish oil capsules, is not sufficiently investigated [6]."", ""Those who swallow preparations containing vitamin B6, B12 and folic acid should not be able to prevent mild to mild Alzheimer's disease from progressing [6].""]",2,"The provided sentences indicate that studies show no significant improvement in memory performance or mental capacity in Alzheimer's patients using omega-3 fatty acids and related supplements, suggesting that the claim about Souvenaid's effectiveness is not supported by the evidence.",Three randomized-controlled trials show that such a dietary supplement (Souvenaid®) is unlikely to markedly slow or halt the progression of Alzheimer's dementia. Taking omega-3 fatty acid or vitamin B supplements alone also does not appear to have such an effect.
Does meditation help against stress?,"['Stress reduction in healthy people is shown, but not whether it is actually due to treatment.', 'A new review [3] summarizes 47 studies and brings better data – even if things remain complicated: Although some forms of meditation work against stress, only in comparison to control groups that receive no other targeted treatment.', 'The authors of an overview of mindfulness-based stress reduction [4] report in their summary that this form of therapy improves mental health, both in healthy people and in some patients with mental illnesses.', 'According to the systematic review work of 2014, not all types of meditation are equally effective: for mindfulness-based meditation, an effectiveness can be demonstrated, but not for transcendental meditation, in which the concentration of attention is sought to dissolve [3].']",0,"The sentences indicate that while some forms of meditation may reduce stress compared to control groups, the evidence is not definitive for all types of meditation, suggesting that the claim about meditation's effectiveness against stress is not fully supported.","Various forms of meditation seem to be able to alleviate stress both in healthy individuals and in people with mental illness. Studies on this are numerous, but the quality of the studies is consistently unsatisfactory."
Are there methods that effectively help against hormonal hair loss?,"['The efficacy of the active substance minoxidil is very well secured.', 'Regular use of a 2 or 3% minoxidil solution on the scalp may lead to cosmetically significant improvements in approximately three out of ten men affected [6].', 'Also in women with hormonal hair loss shows the treatment with Minoxidil effect.', 'Also scientifically well documented is the effect of finasteride [1] [2] [4] [5] [6].', 'There is evidence that the active substance can improve hormonal hair loss, as it intervenes in the hormone balance similar to finasteride.']",0,"The provided sentences discuss the effectiveness of minoxidil and finasteride in treating hormonal hair loss, indicating that these methods can lead to significant improvements for both men and women affected by this condition.","Besides own hair transplantation, the active substances finasteride or minoxidil (as a solution) can help, but both agents have side effects. The effectiveness of other means is hardly or not secured."
Does eye training help prevent myopia?,"['A systematic review did not find a controlled study in 2005 that could show an effect of eye training on shortsightedness – nor any that would suggest a preventive effect of eye training [1].', 'For other forms of falseness, there are also small and methodologically weak studies that find no difference between eye training and a control group [1].', 'But in most cases there is no evidence of the effect of visual training [1] [3].']",2,"The sentences indicate that systematic reviews and studies have found no evidence supporting the effectiveness of eye training in preventing myopia, directly refuting the claim.","According to the current state of studies, an effectiveness of eye training can only be expected for very few diseases; an effect as prevention or therapy against myopia cannot be assumed at present."
Does Cryolipolysis cause noticeable body fat reduction?,"['Whether the method can effectively reduce body fat cannot be said based on its results.', 'Whether the reason for the alleged figure improvements after three to six or twelve months was actually the cold treatment, however, can not be determined by previous-after-comparisons without an untreated control group anyway.', 'Even if the authors of previously published studies conjure the effectiveness of cryolipolysis – this cannot be objectively assessed on the basis of their results.']",1,The sentences indicate that the effectiveness of cryolipolysis in reducing body fat cannot be conclusively determined due to the lack of control groups and objective assessments in previous studies.,"The effectiveness of cryolipolysis cannot be assessed objectively, as there are no scientific efficacy studies on it."
Is acupuncture for chronic pain more effective than placebo acupuncture treatment?,"['Acupuncture slightly surpasses dummy treatment A recent study is now to show that the pain-relieving effect of acupuncture exceeds that of a mere placebo effect, several media write.', 'The very thorough analysis of all these clinical studies showed that acupuncture in chronic pain was not only better than no treatment, but also slightly better than a sham acupuncture.', 'Also in fibromyalgia, a chronic pain disorder of the musculature, acupuncture probably has a slight, but hardly noticeably better effect than sham acupuncture [9].', 'Even if the mechanism of action of acupuncture is unknown and the placebo effect is partly responsible for its analgesic effect, it appears to be an interesting alternative or additional therapy for patients with chronic pain.']",0,"The sentences indicate that while acupuncture shows some effectiveness for chronic pain compared to sham treatments, the improvements are slight and may not be significantly greater than placebo effects, suggesting that the claim about acupuncture being more effective than placebo is not strongly supported.","Acupuncture is slightly superior to sham acupuncture treatment for some types of pain. However, pain patients are unlikely to notice this difference."
Can Internet-based self-help training based on cognitive behavioral therapy reduce the burden of tinnitus?,"['Accordingly, the authors of a systematic review of Cochrane Collaboration [ 1 ] found strong evidence that cognitive behavioral therapy can lead to a noticeable improvement in the quality of life despite persistent tinnitus.', 'In addition, the therapy can lead to a low relief of depressive moods, which suffer from numerous tinnitus patients.', 'The self-help training developed at Linköping University in Sweden is a version of an already proven cognitive behavioral therapy program for tinnitus patients adapted to the Internet.', 'But also a newly developed Internet program to increase tinnitus acceptance with the help of mindfulness-based strategies proved equally effective.', 'Summary It seems likely that cognitive therapies for tinnitus management not only bring improvement in traditional group sessions, but also in the form of Internet-based self-help training programs.']",0,"The sentences indicate that cognitive behavioral therapy, including Internet-based self-help training, has shown strong evidence of improving quality of life for tinnitus patients, suggesting that such programs can effectively reduce the burden of tinnitus.","Cognitive behavioral therapy can noticeably improve the quality of life and depressiveness of tinnitus sufferers.

Nevertheless, it is completely unclear whether this supports weight loss; that is, whether the process is strong enough and whether other mechanisms do not work against it. Weight loss through freezing has not been investigated in clinical studies."
Does acupuncture help against hay fever?,"['As with other acupuncture studies, it is therefore questionable whether the improvement of hay fever symptoms was due to the needle stitches themselves.', 'In order to distinguish between the placebo effect and the specific effect of acupuncture in the future, further studies with better study designs are necessary.']",1,"The sentences indicate uncertainty about the effectiveness of acupuncture for hay fever, suggesting that further research is needed to clarify whether any observed improvements are due to acupuncture itself or other factors.",We have not found any meaningful studies that can provide evidence of improvement in hay fever.
Do earrings cause discomfort by destroying acupuncture points or meridians?,"['However, we could not find any studies that would have investigated earrings and their effects on meridians or acupuncture points.']",1,The absence of studies investigating the effects of earrings on meridians or acupuncture points suggests that there is insufficient evidence to support the claim that earrings cause discomfort by destroying these points.,"Earrings very often lead to complications, fortunately most of them are harmless. However, whether earrings can also destroy meridians or similar representation points of body regions in the auricle and thus lead to health complaints has not been investigated in studies."

Does taking antibiotics for acute sinusitis speed up the healing of the infection?,"['They say that antibiotics can shorten acute sinus inflammation a little – but only in a few people.', 'Sickness duration: only 5 out of 100 benefit What is the benefit of taking an antibiotic on the cure, i.e.', 'This means that only 5 out of 100 people with acute rhinosinusitis benefit from taking an antibiotic instead of a dummy medication.']",0,"The sentences indicate that antibiotics provide minimal benefit for acute sinusitis, with only 5 out of 100 people experiencing a positive effect, suggesting that they do not significantly speed up healing from the infection.","Taking antibiotics can somewhat speed up the healing of an acute sinus infection. However, the success rate is not exhilarating: antibiotics lead to a faster recovery in only 5 out of 100 people. Pain and impairment in everyday life are not improved. And, of course, antibiotics can cause side effects. All in all, antibiotics often don't have much benefit in acute sinusitis."
Does colonoscopy reduce mortality from colorectal cancer?,"['[a] There is good evidence for the effectiveness of small colonoscopy: A review of the 2013 Cochrane Collaboration shows that it can reduce the risk of colon cancer by about a third [1].', 'Thus, all possible cancer precursors can never be discovered with certainty – only for this reason the claim that one can virtually eradicate colon cancer with this preventive measure is clearly too high.', 'The colonoscopy is an effective method to achieve optimum benefit with minimal side effects, but still requires a lot of research, even if it takes very long-term investigations to obtain clear results.']",0,"The sentences indicate that while colonoscopy can reduce the risk of colon cancer, it cannot guarantee the complete eradication of the disease, suggesting that the claim about its effectiveness in reducing mortality from colorectal cancer is not fully supported.","For the small colonoscopy (sigmoidoscopy) an effectiveness is well proven, whether the large colonoscopy (colonoscopy) works even better is not proven. It is not possible that colorectal cancer could be prevented entirely."
Do nicotine replacement products like nicotine gum or nicotine patches help with long-term smoking cessation?,"['Those who called for additional support, such as consultations and discussions with professionals, could further improve the chances of a smoke stop.']",0,"The provided sentences suggest that additional support, such as professional consultations, may enhance the likelihood of quitting smoking, but they do not specifically address the effectiveness of nicotine replacement products like gum or patches in achieving long-term cessation.","The benefits of nicotine replacement have been proven in numerous studies. Compared to a placebo, more people manage not to smoke after six months or longer. The success can even be increased somewhat by additional support (counseling, talks)."
"Is short, high-intensity training equally effective as longer, moderate-intensity training?",['Whether the fitness level remains comparable over a long period of time had not been investigated in any of the studies.'],0,"The provided sentence indicates that the long-term effectiveness of short, high-intensity training compared to longer, moderate-intensity training has not been studied, leaving the claim unaddressed.","Yes, possibly.

Exercise has a beneficial effect in the prevention of diabetes. Whether physical activity can completely offset the risk of a predominantly sedentary lifestyle, or the extent to which this would be necessary, is not clear from the available studies."
Do acupuncture or related smoking cessation methods help you stay smoke-free for at least 6 months?,"['The acupuncture-like mesotherapy for quitting smoking, which was addressed in News, has not yet been investigated in any scientific study – a statement of its effectiveness is therefore currently not possible.', 'In summary, there is currently no clear objective, non-contradictory evidence that acupuncture methods can facilitate the cessation of smoking.', 'In addition, nicotine substitute gums turned out to be more effective than acupuncture.']",0,"The sentences indicate that there is no scientific evidence supporting the effectiveness of acupuncture or related methods for smoking cessation, suggesting that they do not help individuals stay smoke-free for at least 6 months.","There is no evidence for a long-lasting success of smoking cessation with the help of acupuncture or similar methods. In the short term, acupuncture might help slightly. Overall, however, acupuncture is clearly inferior to nicotine replacement therapy."

Can negative expectancy reduce the effect of pain medications?,"['Benefits and damage from nothing In randomized controlled studies, the nocebo effect can be observed well.']",2,"The mention of the nocebo effect in randomized controlled studies suggests that negative expectancy can indeed influence the effectiveness of pain medications, potentially reducing their benefits.","Studies clearly show that ineffective placebo can bring severe side effects, depending on the patient's expectations. One effect can also be that the effectiveness of painkillers is limited."
Is sex as good an endurance workout as running?,"['Canadian researchers compared the energy consumption during sex with a moderate training on a treadmill [1].', 'The result: In a sexual act, both men and women consume significantly less calories on average than in a half-hour treadmill training [1].', 'According to study authors, the performance would be roughly like a leisurely walk.', 'One person found that sex was not more beneficial than treadmill training, whether woman or man is not stated.']",2,"The sentences indicate that sex consumes significantly fewer calories than moderate treadmill training, suggesting that sex is not as good an endurance workout as running.","Studies show that physical exertion during sex is present but rather moderate.

Do milk or dairy products promote bladder cancer?,"['Intestinal cancer and bladder cancer risk reduced For some types of cancer, the consumption of large amounts of milk and dairy products seems to be able to reduce the risk of cancer.', 'At least for cancer in the colon and the rectum, the results show a direct connection with the amount of milk product: the more milk and dairy products the study participants consumed, the greater the protection effect.', 'A potentially increased prostate risk due to very high milk and dairy consumption is thus opposed to a likely reduction in the risk of colorectal cancer.']",2,"The provided sentences indicate that while high consumption of milk and dairy products may reduce the risk of certain cancers, such as colorectal cancer, there is no evidence presented that supports the claim that these products promote bladder cancer.","It is likely that dairy products reduce the risk of colon and rectal cancer, and possibly bladder cancer.
