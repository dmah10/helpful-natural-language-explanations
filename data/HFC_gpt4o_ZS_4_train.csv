Can masks reduce corona infections when worn by a large proportion of the population?,"['Studies show slow spread After three years of pandemic, there are now relatively meaningful data that masks can slow down the spread of the Corona virus.', 'Surgical masks, in turn, seem to reduce the risk of infecting themselves with the corona virus.']",0,"The sentences indicate that studies have shown masks can slow the spread of the coronavirus and that surgical masks can reduce the risk of self-infection, suggesting that masks worn by a large proportion of the population could indeed help reduce infections.","International studies suggest that the number of corona infections decreases when many people wear masks - whether fabric, surgical or FFP2 masks. However, it is not possible to precisely quantify how great the protective effect actually is. It probably depends on the type of masks and the proportion of people who wear them."
Can homeopathic preparations with Anamirta cocculus help against dizziness?,"['But without success: We could not find any meaningful scientific evidence for effectiveness in dizziness.', 'It is now well proven by studies that homeopathic preparations usually do not work better than a sham medication (placebo) [8].', 'However, it is not well established that betahistine is effective against dizziness [11.13].', 'The fact that betahist helps with dizziness is not well documented [11, 13].']",1,"The sentences indicate a lack of meaningful scientific evidence supporting the effectiveness of homeopathic preparations, including Anamirta cocculus, for treating dizziness.","We have found only one study that has investigated this. However, it is so poor that no reliable statement is possible."
Can zeolite alleviate or prevent health problems?,"['However, none of these can provide any evidence – because the studies have no significance (for reasons see section Studies in detail ).', 'It does not find an advantage for zeolite – but the results are hardly meaningful.', 'However, it is not researched whether the regular intake of zeolite can lead to a nutrient deficiency or has an undesirable effect on digestion.']",1,"The sentences indicate a lack of significant evidence regarding the benefits of zeolite for health problems and raise concerns about potential negative effects, suggesting that the claim cannot be substantiated.",Studies to date cannot provide any evidence that taking zeolite prevents or alleviates complaints. A detoxifying effect is not scientifically plausible.
Does paxlovid protect unvaccinated people with risk factors from severe or even fatal covid 19 disease?,"['Patients at risk without corona vaccination appear to be well protected from serious to fatal events by Paxlovid.', 'However, it is not certain how well Paxlovid helps people who have already received corona vaccination.', 'In addition, the scientists investigated whether Paxlovid alleviated the Covid-19 symptoms, shortened the duration of the disease and reduced the need for medical treatment: Half of the participants improved the symptoms with Paxlovid after 13 days, with placebo after 15 days.', 'With Paxlovid, 14 out of 1000 participants needed medical treatment for Covid-19 within a month, with placebo 76 out of 1000.', 'Whether with or without antibodies in the blood, Paxlovid basically protected all humans from a severe course.']",0,"The sentences indicate that Paxlovid provides protection against severe outcomes for unvaccinated patients at risk, but do not clarify its effectiveness for vaccinated individuals, leaving uncertainty regarding the overall protective benefits of Paxlovid for the specified group in the claim.","In a large, well-done study, paxlovid prevented hospitalizations and deaths in high-risk patients. They were unvaccinated and had contracted the delta variant. For vaccinated people, the benefit cannot be reliably estimated. This also applies to people with immunodeficiency."
"Does starting school later improve health, learning success, and quality of life in adolescents?","['However, teenagers and parents now have to be very strong: despite 27 studies involving hundreds of thousands of students, no clear results can be derived from research.', 'The problem: The studies usually come to contradictory results.', 'So until better research results are available, all troubled young people and parents will only have the option of remaining out of bed early – or to hope that, despite lack of evidence, the school management will still have an insight into it.', 'It is difficult to examine whether a later start to school will have a positive effect.', 'The Problems: Unknown Influencing Factors: If differences occur in previous-after-studies, these do not have to be due to the later start of school – they may also have been caused by other changes over the course of the study period.']",1,"The sentences indicate that despite numerous studies, the evidence regarding the impact of starting school later on health, learning success, and quality of life in adolescents is inconclusive and often contradictory, suggesting that no definitive conclusions can be drawn at this time.","The question has been investigated in several large studies. Due to methodological deficiencies and contradictory results, no firm conclusions can be drawn. This means that science can currently neither speak for nor against a benefit of a later school start."
Does the F.X. Mayr cure have health benefits? Can it prevent diseases or treat them?,"['Thus, the claim that the method can help with various diseases is not scientifically justified.', 'These studies cannot answer whether these changes also affect health.', 'Mayr cure or other fasting methods improve health in the long term, however, cannot be concluded.']",1,The sentences indicate that there is insufficient scientific evidence to support the claim that the F.X. Mayr cure has health benefits or can prevent or treat diseases.,"It is neither examined nor proven whether the special fasting method after F.X. Mayr holds, which it promises: Namely assistance with all possible illnesses of allergies, over rheumatism up to sleep disturbances. The advertised detoxification and ""purification"" of the body by the chamfering cure are besides scientifically not plausible."
Does the consumption of soy foods or soy isoflavones affect the appearance of acne skin?,"['In both cases, certain soya ingredients are responsible for the effect on the skin: the isoflavones.', 'There are two competing theories that contradict each other: according to the first theory, isoflavones confuse the hormone balance and are supposed to promote acne in this way.', 'Surprisingly, despite searching in two large databases, we could not find a study on soy products and acne – whether soy milk, soy sauce or tofu.', 'The isoflavones improved the skin appearance more than an anti-acne cream with vitamin A acid (Tretinoin).', 'Conclusion: There is currently no evidence from reliable studies that soy makes acne worse.']",1,"The sentences indicate that while there are theories suggesting isoflavones may promote acne, there is no reliable evidence from studies to support that soy foods worsen acne, and in fact, isoflavones have been shown to improve skin appearance.","We could not find any meaningful studies at all on the influence of soy foods on acne. On soy isoflavones, we found two small studies of questionable quality that examined a very specific group of sufferers. Soy isoflavones improved the skin appearance somewhat. However, this result is not reliable."
Does extract from the Damiana plant (Turnera diffusa) help with erectile dysfunction?,"['Efficacy does not appear to have been studied or demonstrated.', 'The studies in detail We could not find any studies on Damiana extract against erectile dysfunction in men.', 'Studies on the product Neradin also appear to be missing.']",1,The lack of studies or demonstrated efficacy regarding Damiana extract in relation to erectile dysfunction indicates that there is insufficient information to support the claim.,"The extract from the Damiana plant (Turnera diffusa) is advertised as a remedy for erectile dysfunction for men.

Does regular HPV testing in addition to the recommended Pap smear detect more precancerous lesions than just the Pap smear alone?,"['According to the studies, the HPV test is likely to detect slightly more precursors of cervical cancer over several years than the PAP swab alone.', 'We are therefore relatively sure that with an additional HPV test at least a little more precursors of uterine cancer are detected than only with the PAP swab alone.']",0,"The sentences indicate that studies suggest the HPV test detects more precursors of cervical cancer than the Pap smear alone, supporting the claim that regular HPV testing in addition to the Pap smear is more effective in detecting precancerous lesions.","Regular examination of the cervix by means of PAP smear tests detects precancerous stages of the cervix in most cases in good time. This reduces the risk of developing cervical cancer. An additional HPV test every three to five years can make screening even more reliable. However, the difference should not be too great."
Can monk's pepper reduce PMS symptoms? PMS is the abbreviation for premenstrual syndrome. This refers to complaints that occur in the days before menstruation.,"['Reference to efficacy in PMS According to previous studies, monk peppers could actually help in PMS.', 'The summarized study results indicate that the symptoms with monk pepper are reduced in more patients than with a sham medication (placebo).', 'Therefore, it would be possible for monk peppers to act against PMS symptoms such as breast spacing.']",0,"The provided sentences indicate that previous studies suggest monk pepper may help reduce PMS symptoms, implying a potential efficacy that aligns with the claim.","In the studies to date, monk's pepper seems to relieve PMS symptoms better than a placebo. However, this is not well proven, because the studies have significant weaknesses. There is no evidence of an effect on menstrual disorders. Significant studies are lacking."
Can olive leaf extract reduce high blood pressure?,"['These studies therefore do not indicate whether olive leaf extract can help with significantly increased blood pressure.', 'Without success, however, we could not find any studies that investigated the effect of olive leaf extract on cardiovascular health.', 'However, they cannot provide clear answers.', 'It is therefore impossible to say whether olive leaves extract could have a better or worse effect with significantly increased blood pressure.']",1,"The sentences indicate a lack of studies and clear evidence regarding the effect of olive leaf extract on high blood pressure, making it impossible to determine its potential benefits or drawbacks for this condition.","Whether olive leaf extract lowers blood pressure has been investigated in five suitable studies to date. They all found no effect or only a slight effect of the extract. The problem with this is that most of the study participants had only slightly elevated blood pressure. They cannot answer how olive leaf extract works in people with significantly elevated blood pressure (hypertension). The studies also had gross flaws, few participants, and ran for a very short time. They cannot provide reliable answers."
Do green-lipped mussel preparations improve the symptoms of osteoarthritis?,"['Studies overall not meaningful The conclusion of our research: Scientific evidence for the claimed effect is missing.', 'It is also unclear whether the measured positive effects are large enough to actually be felt by those affected.', 'Whether or not green-lipped mussel helps with osteoarthritis cannot be said at the moment.', 'However, as early as 2009, the European Food Safety Authority considered that a protective effect of the green-lipped mussel on healthy joints has not been established.', 'In our opinion, no reliable conclusions can be drawn from the studies found.']",1,"The sentences indicate a lack of scientific evidence supporting the effectiveness of green-lipped mussel preparations for improving osteoarthritis symptoms, highlighting uncertainty about their benefits and the absence of established protective effects.","The question was examined in four small studies with serious methodological deficiencies, which also arrived at partly contradictory results.

Can CBD (cannabidiol) help with migraines or other headaches?,"['Apparently, CBD has never been investigated to see if it can help with migraine seizures.', 'The claim that CBD would help with migraines or headaches is pure speculation.', 'The studies in detail Despite extensive search in three databases, we could not find any studies on CBD against migraine or other types of headache, neither for treatment nor for prevention.']",1,"The provided sentences indicate that there is no research supporting the effectiveness of CBD for migraines or headaches, suggesting that the claim lacks sufficient evidence.",There are no studies that have investigated the effectiveness of CBD against migraine. So claims that CBD can help with or prevent migraine attacks have no scientific basis. The same is true for other types of headache.
Can laser irradiation of blood by infusion needle (hemolaser treatment) relieve discomfort or help with diseases?,"['It is also unclear by what mechanism blood irradiation with bundled red light – i.e.', 'red laser – should improve health.', 'Although the authors of the three studies found [1-3] claim to have established a clear efficacy of haemolaser treatment, none of the three studies is suitable to prove this.']",1,"The sentences indicate that the mechanism by which hemolaser treatment could improve health is unclear and that the studies claiming its efficacy are not suitable for proving its effectiveness, suggesting insufficient evidence to support the claim.",There is no scientific evidence that hemolaser treatment has a palliative or curative effect on health problems.
"In everyday life, when breathing with an FFP2 mask or ordinary mouth-nose protection, do you get as much oxygen as without a mask?","['As much oxygen as without a mask This fear is, however, unfounded, as previously conducted studies show [ 1,2 ].', 'Only in very strenuous sports (fast cycling to exhaustion) was the oxygen content in the blood with FFP2 mask slightly lower than without mask.', 'There was no difference in oxygen measurement with ordinary oral nose protection.', 'Breathing a little more strenuous The results thus contradict the rumor that masks would cause an oxygen deficiency.']",0,"The sentences indicate that studies show no significant difference in oxygen levels when wearing FFP2 masks or ordinary mouth-nose protection compared to not wearing a mask, thereby refuting the claim that masks cause an oxygen deficiency.","Even if breathing with a mask can feel uncomfortable: According to studies to date, you get just as much oxygen with an FFP2 mask or mouth-nose protection as without a mask. This is true even when you are moving or exerting yourself. Only very intensive sports slightly reduce the oxygen content in the blood - but too little to endanger health."
Can CBD help with period pain?,"['Because despite searching in three different databases we could not find a single study on CBD in case of regular pain.', 'Scientifically, it is not sufficiently researched whether CBD actually promotes sleep, as providers claim.', 'The studies in detail We could not find any studies that investigated whether CBD can help with normal pain – neither for treatment nor for prevention.']",1,"The sentences indicate a lack of research on the effectiveness of CBD for pain relief, including period pain, suggesting that there is insufficient evidence to support the claim.",Whether CBD can relieve menstrual pain has apparently never been scientifically studied. We could not find any studies on this. Women who suffer from severe period pain should talk to a gynecologist about it. Diseases such as endometriosis could be behind it.
Does arthroscopy (joint endoscopy) help with osteoarthritis of the knee joint?,"['What might sound logical, however, has a catch: the arthroscopy of osteoarthritis does nothing to the treated person.', 'Studies clearly speak against a benefit A research team summarized the most meaningful of all previously published studies on arthroscopy in knee arthritis.', 'In these studies, patients treated after arthroscopy had no noticeably less pain or movement restrictions than those treated only for appearance or not at all.', 'Arthroscopy against osteoarthritis: not effective, but also not very risky After all: Undesirable events were not conspicuously common in the arthroscopy groups either.']",2,"The sentences indicate that arthroscopy for osteoarthritis of the knee does not provide any significant benefits in terms of pain relief or improved movement, suggesting that the procedure is ineffective for this condition.",The data are clear: Arthroscopy is useless as a treatment for knee osteoarthritis. It can neither relieve pain nor improve the function of the knee joint in the long term.
"Do dietary supplements containing silicon (e.g. as ""organic silicon"" or silica) have health benefits?","['So far it is also completely unclear what role the element silicon plays in the human body at all [8].', 'We have researched: Previous studies do not provide any evidence that dietary supplements with silicon support bone build-up and thus protect older women from osteoporosis and bone fractures in old age [1,2].', 'There is no evidence that silicon improves the hair structure [3,4], strengthens the fingernails [4] or makes the skin more beautiful and elastic [4,6,7].', 'Also that silicon supports the formation of collagen and connective tissue is only a conjecture [8].', 'Conjectures without studies Neither we nor the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) [8] were able to find clinical studies on any other alleged health benefits of silicon.']",1,"The provided sentences indicate a lack of evidence supporting the health benefits of dietary supplements containing silicon, highlighting that previous studies have not demonstrated any positive effects on bone health, hair structure, nail strength, skin elasticity, or collagen formation.","There is no evidence so far that the additional intake of silicon can promote health.

"Does taking polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as omega-3 and omega-6, reduce ADHD symptoms in children?","['Overall, the preparations do not seem to make children with ADHD quieter and more concentrated.', 'Whether omega fatty acid preparations or placebo, all children showed similarly strong ADHD symptoms.', 'On closer examination, it appears that the best-performed, blinded studies show no or even a negative effect of the omega fatty acid preparations on the behaviour of the participating children.']",2,"The sentences indicate that omega fatty acid preparations do not improve ADHD symptoms in children, suggesting that they do not reduce these symptoms as claimed.","Studies to date suggest that supplements containing polyunsaturated fatty acids (for example, omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids) tend not to have a noticeable effect on attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, the quality of the studies is not sufficient to provide definitive answers."
Do infusions of vitamin C relieve symptoms of chronic fatigue or long covid?,"['It is also unclear whether people with Long Covid benefit from vitamin C infusions.', 'One of the two authors is also an employee of a pharmaceutical company that also offers products with vitamin C.  Since the developmental mechanisms of both chronic fatigue syndrome and long covid are unclear, studies with cancer patients or healthy participants cannot provide answers to the question whether vitamin C can help people with chronic fatigue syndrome or long covid.']",1,"The sentences indicate uncertainty about the benefits of vitamin C infusions for individuals with Long Covid or chronic fatigue syndrome, highlighting the lack of clear evidence and the relevance of study populations.",Whether vitamin C infusions help with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is questionable. This has not yet been scientifically investigated. We also could not find a single study on vitamin C and fatigue occurring in the context of Long Covid.
Does taking probiotics shorten the duration of acute infectious diarrhea?,"['Thus, at least in children, taking live probiotics is unlikely to affect whether they are still ill after 48 hours.', 'Thus, a probiotic apparently has no clear influence on the resolution of the disease.']",2,"The sentences indicate that taking probiotics does not significantly impact the duration of illness in children with acute infectious diarrhea, suggesting that probiotics do not shorten the duration of the condition.","According to current studies, the duration of disease cannot be reduced by taking probiotics.

It is possible that individuals with unremarkable body mass index are also at risk. In the coming years, new studies will probably allow a better assessment."
Does the dietary supplement MSM help with osteoarthritis?,"['The use of MSM capsules is intended to help with various diseases, for example, osteoarthritis.', 'The dietary supplement MSM is also intended to help osteoarthritis afflicted.', 'However, there may be some effects, although the study situation is still somewhat poor.', '• There are some indications in the statistics of these studies that MSM can help with certain joint problems.', 'Perhaps MSM is only suitable for certain groups of people, or it is more effective in combination with other means.']",0,"The sentences suggest that while MSM is intended to help with osteoarthritis and there are some indications of its effectiveness, the overall evidence is limited and inconclusive.","There are indications of a possible positive effect of MSM in osteoarthritis. However, it is not very well proven to what extent these effects discovered in studies are also noticeable and sustainable in the everyday life of those affected."
Is the DMPS test suitable to reliably indicate mercury poisoning?,"['Not approved, but with risks Given the quality deficiencies, it is not surprising that the DMPS test is not allowed to detect mercury poisoning.', 'In any case, we could not find any work convincingly explaining the advantages of a DMPS test for people with unspecific complaints.', 'Conclusion: not recommended for diagnosis A DMPS test is expensive, can cause side effects, and its results are not clearly classified.', 'All in all, the DMPS test for the detection of mercury poisoning does not appear to be recommended; the test does not seem to provide any health benefits.', 'Mercury insecurity The popularity of the DMPS test, despite the lack of studies, may have to do with the increased sensitivity of the population to mercury.']",1,"The sentences collectively indicate that the DMPS test is not approved for detecting mercury poisoning due to quality deficiencies, lack of convincing evidence for its advantages, high costs, potential side effects, and absence of health benefits, suggesting it is not a reliable indicator for mercury poisoning.","There are currently no well-done studies with reliable statements on the subject. So it remains open whether the DMPS test really benefits people who suspect heavy metal poisoning. However, risks of DMPS are known. All in all, this diagnostic tool therefore does not appear to be recommendable."
Can stevia lower high blood pressure?,"['Although this trend was observed in a systematic review, the effect was very small [5].', 'We found a systematic review of the effect of blood pressure lowering.', 'Due to the blood pressure lowering effect, people with low blood pressure should be careful with the sweetener.']",0,"The sentences mention a systematic review indicating a small effect on blood pressure, but they do not provide sufficient evidence to confirm that stevia specifically lowers high blood pressure.","With all foods, ""the dose makes the poison"". As a sugar-free sweetener, substances from the stevia plant do not promote tooth decay and have no calories. A medical benefit beyond that may be an effectiveness against high blood pressure."
Is eating genetically modified corn a health concern?,"['Unexplored hazards for humans Whether genetically modified maize varieties can pose a potential health risk for humans is still little researched.', 'Little meaningful On closer examination, however, these abnormalities proved to be of little significance, since they could have occurred by chance.', 'In any case, there is no concrete evidence of a noticeable toxicity of genetically modified maize plants for humans in scientific literature – with a share of 70% of all maize plants grown in the USA.', '[6] Nevertheless, there are no investigations to exclude possible rare long-term effects in humans – after all, a human being differs significantly from a rat in several characteristics.']",1,"The sentences indicate that while there is limited research on the health risks of genetically modified corn, there is also no concrete evidence of toxicity, suggesting that the claim about health concerns remains unsubstantiated.",Several feeding studies in rats over short periods of time provide no clear indications of a health concern for various genetically modified corn varieties Whether side effects may occur over a longer period of time cannot be answered due to the lack of conclusive long-term studies in humans.
Are privately performed IgG tests to clarify food intolerances meaningful?,"['However, the risk of shortages Experts, especially of allergology, warn against such tests: They point out that so far there has been no clear evidence of food intolerances caused by IgG.', 'Basic problems All studies have a fundamental problem: the patients in the treatment and control group ate different foods.', 'This does not make it clear whether a possible improvement of the complaints is actually due to IgG testing or rather to the choice of food.', 'A benefit of the IgG tests can therefore also not be conclusively demonstrated by the studies in persons with intestinal diseases.', 'Since the study lasted only four weeks, it is not possible to draw conclusions about longer-term results.']",1,"The sentences highlight the lack of clear evidence supporting the effectiveness of privately performed IgG tests for food intolerances, citing fundamental issues in study design and the inability to demonstrate long-term benefits.",Whether elevated levels of immunoglobulin G in the blood are actually signs of intolerance to certain foods is highly controversial. Studies in which people with intestinal diseases avoid specific foods provide no clear evidence of benefit.
Is a gluten-free diet recommended for people who do not have celiac disease?,"['Whether gluten itself does not actually cause digestive problems, if one does not suffer from celiac disease, has to be examined better in larger studies.', 'Hardly surprising, there are no solid long-term studies on healthy individuals on the risks of a gluten-free diet.', 'Currently, there are no convincing studies that argue for the absence of gluten by healthy people.', 'So we currently do not know whether a gluten-free diet has long-term advantages.', 'Overall, the studies conducted so far on gluten-free nutrition in people without celiac disease are not meaningful.']",1,"The sentences indicate that there is a lack of solid evidence and meaningful studies regarding the benefits or risks of a gluten-free diet for individuals without celiac disease, suggesting that the claim about its recommendation is not clearly supported.","There are no well-done studies that have investigated gluten abstinence in people who do not suffer from the autoimmune disease celiac disease. Therefore, there is a lack of reliable data on the possible benefits of a long-term gluten-free diet in the general population.

Do protein supplements help build muscle?,"['Methodical Deficiencies Scratch in Significance However, the significance of the summarized study results is limited because only a few subjects had participated in the individual studies.', 'The results also do not allow conclusions to be drawn on the effect of protein powders, drinks and bars.', 'It is therefore unclear whether it must be the expensive protein powder or whether it is enough to eat more milk, yoghurt and co.', 'According to the summarized results of previously published studies, however, it does not seem to matter whether older people take protein supplements in addition to muscle building training.', 'Our question about the effectiveness of protein powders, beverages and bars cannot be answered for another reason.']",1,The sentences indicate that the effectiveness of protein supplements for building muscle is inconclusive due to limited study participation and insufficient evidence to differentiate between supplements and regular dietary sources of protein.,"A lot of research is being done in the field. However, the studies often have methodological flaws and contradictory results. It is therefore currently unclear whether and in what form supplemental proteins can help on the way to a six-pack and biceps."
Does music therapy promote recovery from severe limitations of consciousness after severe brain injury?,"['Effects of music therapy too little investigated In a detailed literature research, we have only been able to promote few relevant investigations to the surface.', 'None of the studies found involved music as a single treatment for severe brain damage and unconsciousness.', 'Most studies have had very few patients, have serious methodological deficiencies and do not answer the question whether the patients actually achieve significant and long-term improvements in consciousness through treatment.', 'This makes it unclear whether the results are transferable to people who have been in a wake-up coma or minimal state of consciousness for a long time.', 'In addition, it is unclear whether the results of the study can also be transferred to other forms of treatment such as playing familiar pieces of music.']",1,"The sentences indicate that there is insufficient investigation and methodological rigor in existing studies on music therapy's effects on severe limitations of consciousness, making it unclear whether music therapy can effectively promote recovery in such cases.","We have not found any high-quality studies that specifically investigate the effect of music therapy.

Can garlic extract reduce high blood pressure and thus the risk of cardiovascular disease?,"['Two better performed randomised-controlled studies provide cautious evidence that garlic can lower too high blood pressure [1].', 'However, even the results of these two studies are insufficiently valid for a clear assessment [1].', 'Whether garlic taken regularly can lower too high blood pressure and thus lower the risk of cardiovascular disease remains unclear for the time being.', 'At least in theory, there may also be interactions with anticoagulant drugs or side effects in persons with a tendency to bleed, as garlic is suspected to have an anticoagulant effect.']",1,"The sentences indicate that while there is some evidence from studies suggesting garlic may lower high blood pressure, the validity of these findings is questionable, and it remains uncertain whether garlic can effectively reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.","Studies to date provide tentative evidence of a blood pressure-lowering effect of garlic. However, they are of too low quality to be able to prove a reduction in the risk of cardiovascular disease as a result of high blood pressure."
Can fructose damage the liver?,"['Fruit sugar as a cause not proven There are no meaningful indications for the assumption that fruit sugar is responsible for the development of the liver disease [1].', 'In other words, for the liver, it may not matter what kind of sugar you eat.']",1,"The sentences indicate that there is no proven link between fructose and liver disease, suggesting that the type of sugar consumed may not significantly impact liver health.",There is no conclusive evidence for a possible liver-damaging effect of fructose.
Can green tea affect the likelihood of dying early and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease?,"['In fact, the summarized results of observational studies show that passionate green tea drinkers live longer on average – apparently because they are less likely to die from cardiovascular diseases such as heart attack [2,3].', ""However, a 100% proven cause-effect relationship à la ‘Green tea use protects against stroke, heart attack and co' cannot be derived from these observational studies."", 'We do not know exactly what the substances from the green tea in our body do – and what amounts can trigger a positive health effect.', 'Overall, the study data show that passionate green tea drinkers are less likely to die from cardiovascular diseases and thus live longer overall.', 'Seven RCTs are summarized here, and the authors concluded that green tea as a beverage or dietary supplement may have a beneficial influence on the risk factors of blood pressure, total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol.']",0,"The sentences indicate that while passionate green tea drinkers may have a lower likelihood of dying from cardiovascular diseases and potentially live longer, the evidence from observational studies does not establish a definitive cause-effect relationship between green tea consumption and reduced early mortality or cardiovascular risk.","There is a lack of conclusive studies on the health effects of specific matcha. However, there is some evidence that green tea in general may reduce the likelihood of dying prematurely, especially from cardiovascular disease."
Is matcha tea particularly healthy?,"['No recommendations, no warnings Due to the current study situation, it is therefore not possible to make specific recommendations for tea consumption.', 'The studies in detail Matcha is the trend for many consumers, but in scientific literature this special green tea hardly exists.']",1,"The sentences indicate a lack of specific recommendations and limited scientific literature on matcha tea, suggesting that there is insufficient information to determine its health benefits.","There is a lack of conclusive studies on the health effects of specific matcha.

Can acupuncture prevent migraines and tension headaches?,"['Acupuncture works... From chronic migraines or tension headaches Affected patients get significantly rare headache attacks when they not only take conventional medication, but also undergo prophylactic acupuncture treatment.', '...but as good as migraine medications Another point suggests that acupuncture has a valuable prophylactic effect – at least for migraine sufferers: Further studies showed that acupuncture can only partially prevent migraine attacks, but at least as well as common medications [1].']",0,"The sentences indicate that while acupuncture may reduce the frequency of migraine attacks and has a prophylactic effect, it does not conclusively prevent migraines or tension headaches, suggesting that the claim is not fully supported.","In the case of migraine, the preventive effect of acupuncture is probably similar to that of prophylactic medication. However, for both migraine and tension headaches, acupuncture performs only slightly better than sham acupuncture. Whether the pricking of traditional acupuncture points plays a role is unclear."
Can green tea reduce the likelihood of dying from cancer ?,"['In some studies, there was indeed a slightly reduced probability of disease, but other studies even suggested an increased risk of cancer from the use of green tea.', 'The result provides sobering clarity: people who regularly drink large amounts of green tea die in sum as often at some kind of cancer as people who hardly touch green tea [8].', 'To a degree harmless Although the benefits of green tea against cancer are questionable, there is no evidence of a health-impairing effect in moderate consumption of some cups a day [2].']",2,"The sentences indicate that while some studies suggest a slight reduction in cancer risk associated with green tea, others show no benefit or even an increased risk, leading to uncertainty about its impact on cancer mortality.",The results of previous studies suggest that green tea cannot reduce the risk of dying from cancer.
Can plant sterols or foods with them reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease?,"['However, it is unclear whether the intake of such high amounts of plant sterols – e.g.', 'Whether these results are a coincidence or whether the higher rate of cardiovascular problems are actually due to plant sterols and not to other causes is unclear.', 'Cholesterol is also different Whether plant sterols can actually reduce not only LDL cholesterol levels, but also the risk of cardiovascular diseases, has not been investigated in a single clinical study.']",1,"The sentences indicate uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of plant sterols in reducing cardiovascular disease risk, highlighting a lack of conclusive evidence and the possibility of other contributing factors.","Plant sterols do lower cholesterol levels. However, whether they also reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease has not been researched. Animal studies even provide evidence that plant sterols in large quantities could increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. Whether this also applies to humans has not been investigated."
Can too much iodine cause autoimmune thyroid disease and consequently hypothyroidism?,"['Individual studies suggest that too large amounts of iodine may be responsible.', 'Probably a variety of causes These study results suggest that Hashimoto disease is more likely to occur in people with particularly high iodine consumption.', 'However, large amounts of iodine may cause serious disturbances in people with potentially undetected thyroid problems [8].', 'The studies in detail Whether large amounts of iodine can actually cause inflammation of the thyroid gland by an overreacting immune system is not well protected.', 'The result: the higher the iodine intake in a region, the greater the proportion of residents who suffer from autoimmune thyroid inflammation.']",0,"The sentences indicate a correlation between high iodine consumption and the occurrence of autoimmune thyroid disease, suggesting that excessive iodine may contribute to hypothyroidism in individuals with underlying thyroid issues.",Autoimmune thyroid disease appears to occur more frequently in individuals with high iodine consumption.

Well-done studies that run over a long period of time with a sufficient number of test subjects are scarce. Evidence for long-term safety and simultaneous efficacy is therefore lacking."
Are there health benefits to screening the general population for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as a precaution?,"['Recommendation against COPD screening The answer may surprise: such a precautionary examination does not bring any discernible health benefit.', ""If you don't have any symptoms yet and only learns about a COPD due to the screening, you may not have any benefit at all [1,2]."", 'Here, too, a population-wide COPD early detection does not bring any health benefit.']",2,"The provided sentences indicate that screening the general population for COPD does not yield any health benefits, particularly for asymptomatic individuals, thereby refuting the claim of potential health benefits from such precautionary measures.",Even people with moderately severe COPD may have little health benefit from starting treatment as early as possible. People without symptoms who are diagnosed with COPD only as a result of a screening test are therefore unlikely to gain much health benefit from drug treatment.
Can cow's milk cause iron deficiency in babies in the first year of life?,"[""Moreover, the infant can use iron from cow's milk much worse, because among other things the calcium and casein contained in it inhibits the absorption of iron."", ""Babies actually seem to suffer more from iron deficiency when they are fed cow's milk early on."", ""Only as far as iron deficiency is concerned, statements are possible: Seven out of eight studies suggest that early use of cow's milk in babies significantly increases the risk of iron deficiency.""]",0,"The sentences indicate that cow's milk can hinder iron absorption and that early consumption is linked to a higher risk of iron deficiency in babies, supporting the claim.","Cow's milk is low in usable iron. Therefore, cow's milk appears to increase the likelihood of iron deficiency in the blood of babies. It is unclear whether animal milk increases the risk of type 1 diabetes or blood in the stool, or reduces the likelihood of allergic diseases."
Does drinking breast milk as a baby have a positive effect on later health and development?,"['In any case, it is proven that this form of nutrition has certain health benefits – such as a lower risk for some infectious diseases in infanthood [2] [4] [9] and the sudden death of children, as we have reported here.', 'In later life, the risk of obesity is somewhat reduced [5.6],the IQ of breastfeeding children seems to be a few points higher [7].', 'In summary, the authors believe that drinking breast milk does not produce any practical benefits.', 'For example, breastfeeding may help reduce the risk of certain forms of cancer in children [4] [8,9].']",0,"The sentences present evidence of health benefits associated with drinking breast milk, such as reduced risks of infectious diseases, obesity, and certain cancers, while one sentence contradicts this by stating that drinking breast milk does not produce practical benefits, creating ambiguity regarding the overall positive effects on later health and development.","It is possible that children who have been exclusively breastfed for a long time are somewhat less likely to become overweight later on. There is also evidence that their IQ is slightly higher. However, it is difficult to isolate the influence of breast milk drinking. Therefore, it is questionable what significance the effects found have in practice."
Does Almased help with excess weight better than other diets?,"['None of the studies found uses a meaningful control group.', 'Of course, someone with Almased can lose weight – as with any other way to reduce calories as well.', 'The studies do not show whether Almased is better than a sip of water, honeybread or any other diet product.']",1,"The sentences indicate that there is no evidence from the studies to support the claim that Almased is more effective for weight loss compared to other diets, as they lack meaningful control groups and do not demonstrate superiority over other calorie-reducing methods.","Those who reduce their calorie intake with the help of Almased lose weight. However, whether the product facilitates a diet or works better than other diets is not sufficiently studied."
"Do products with talc, such as baby powder, increase the risk of ovarian cancer?","['Since cohort studies, as described above, are more meaningful than case-control studies, we could claim that the study situation would speak against an increased risk.', 'Conclusion In order to be on the safe side, despite the higher-quality cohort studies that speak against a risk, we consider the risk to be unclear.']",1,"The sentences indicate that while higher-quality cohort studies suggest no increased risk of ovarian cancer from talc products, the conclusion remains that the risk is still considered unclear.","Basically, cohort studies are more informative than case-control studies. The two existing large cohort studies speak against an increased risk, almost all case-control studies for an increased risk. In order not to underestimate a possible risk, we assess the study situation as unclear despite the cohort studies."
"Do large portions, large plates or glasses, and larger packaging cause us to eat and drink more?","['If you get larger portions served, you probably eat more than if the portion had been smaller.', 'Large portions affect everyone On average, large portions tempt us adults to eat about 250 calories more than would be the case with smaller portions.', 'Although the individual studies are largely of unclear or poor methodological quality, they all show consistent in one direction: larger portions encourage people to eat more and possibly drink more.']",0,"The sentences indicate that larger portions lead to increased consumption, suggesting that larger plates, glasses, and packaging indeed cause us to eat and drink more.","The results of previous studies show that people generally seem to eat more and drink more (non-alcoholic) beverages when they are served larger portions.

Does the active ingredient rivaroxaban (drug Xarelto) have a higher risk of dangerous bleeding than other anticoagulants?,"['A summary analysis of studies published so far on rivaroxaban in particular also finds overall less fatal bleeding than in the use of vitamin K antagonists (cumarine) [4], although there has been no overall difference in the number of premature deaths.', 'The comparison of rivaroxaban with other factor Xa inhibitors shows only very small differences: According to a recent summary of several meta-analyses, the active substance of Xarelto does not perform best, but the result is uncertain.', 'Overall, these drugs have the same effect as the older vitamin K antagonist treatment, but with a significantly lower risk of bleeding – the risk is almost halved.', 'According to this, the new drugs avoid strokes more effectively than the older ones, with regard to the risk of bleeding there is no difference.']",2,"The provided sentences indicate that rivaroxaban has a lower risk of bleeding compared to vitamin K antagonists and shows no significant difference in bleeding risk when compared to other factor Xa inhibitors, suggesting that it does not have a higher risk of dangerous bleeding than other anticoagulants.","High-quality studies in the most common uses of rivaroxaban show either an equal or even lower risk of bleeding than other blood-clotting medications. However, this does not mean it is the best choice in all cases. Research is still needed for bleeding in the stomach or intestines."
Does vitamin D protect against dementia or memory loss?,"['[5] [9] Even if, according to current knowledge, it is unclear whether vitamin D is a miracle medicine to prevent or slow down dementia, there is hope.', 'Nevertheless, it is not easy to investigate whether a low vitamin D level often has an influence on the development of dementia years later.']",1,"The sentences indicate that while there is uncertainty about the role of vitamin D in preventing or slowing down dementia, the complexity of investigating its influence on dementia development suggests that definitive conclusions cannot be drawn at this time.",Some studies suggest a possible connection between the vitamin D concentration in the blood and a deteriorating memory or dementia.  Whether vitamin D actually protects against memory deterioration or dementia remains open.
Does brain training boost intelligence?,"['Those who train their memory only get better in these exercises, i.e.', 'The training does not affect other mental tasks such as speech fluid or arithmetic.', 'With a total of only 75 participants it is not very extensive, but strengthens the results of the overview work: even here, a 20-unit training did not improve the general intelligence [2].', 'Another review of 2013 casts doubt on how much cognitive training can be helpful for children and adolescents with various mental developmental disorders [3].']",2,"The sentences indicate that brain training primarily improves specific exercises rather than general intelligence, as evidenced by studies showing no significant impact on broader cognitive tasks.","There are many ways of brain training, but no evidence that it can improve intelligence. The most research in science is about a specific training of the ""working memory"", here the studies speak against a general improvement of intelligence."
Does petroleum help against cancer?,"['One of the legends of Petroleum says that the workers in oil fields do not have cancer.', 'The legend is not confirmed; large studies show that cancers in oil workers are as common as in other parts of the population [1] [2] [3], the risk of cancer is neither greater nor less for workers in the oil industry.', '[a] In Internet forums, kerosene is praised as a curative detox, but this can be thought of as ""detoxins"", we have already described here: https://www.medizin-transparent.at/mdzt4n5p4rnt/detox-of-mythos-vom-detoxins Studies in detail There are no studies on kerosene as a drug for cancer – for good reason, because a positive effect is far less likely than an additional health risk.']",1,"The sentences indicate that there is no confirmed evidence supporting the claim that petroleum helps against cancer, as studies show that cancer rates among oil workers are similar to those in the general population and there are no studies supporting kerosene as a cancer treatment.","This rather absurd assumption has not been tested in studies. Since petroleum is more likely to pose a health hazard, such studies are also not conducted."
Does lavender scent help with sleep disorders?,"['Overall, the study situation is too thin to speak out for or against lavender aromatherapy.', 'Need for clarification in many areas If it turns out that lavender aroma therapy is actually effective, many other questions need to be clarified: How much oil is needed to achieve an effect on sleep quality or duration?', 'However, the better performance of the lavender therapy group could also have other reasons that have nothing to do with the treatment.']",1,"The sentences indicate that the evidence regarding the effectiveness of lavender scent for sleep disorders is insufficient and raises questions about the validity of the results, suggesting that more research is needed to draw any definitive conclusions.","Based on the state of studies, it is unclear whether inhaling lavender aroma can help with sleep disorders. Most of the currently available studies have gross methodological flaws. In addition, it is uncertain what undesirable side effects may result from (long-term) inhalation of lavender aroma."
Does the drug Sovaldi (sofosbuvir) enable high cure rates for chronic hepatitis C?,"['Studies show that the new drug significantly increases treatment success: In patients who have not received treatment before, the chances of healing are now above 90 percent according to most studies [1] [2] [3] [a].', 'The active substance of Sovaldi (sofosbuvir) is very successful in most of these patient groups, although not all groups have the same evidence [1] [2].', 'In any case, Sovaldi and other agents that directly attack the virus have revolutionized the treatment of hepatitis C and studies are currently underway to test the different combinations of drugs in different patient groups.']",0,"The sentences indicate that Sovaldi (sofosbuvir) has significantly increased treatment success rates for chronic hepatitis C, with healing rates above 90 percent in treatment-naive patients, supporting the claim of high cure rates.","Yes, in combination with drugs that have been available for some time, cure rates of over 90 percent are possible with sofosbuvir. However, there are many different patient groups, and success rates are not the same for all."
Does alpha lipoic acid help prevent or treat Alzheimer's disease?,"[""Thus, we do not know whether alpha lipoic acid can mitigate the disease or even protect it from Alzheimer's disease [1]."", 'Due to the few existing observational studies, they could not draw any conclusions or even make recommendations for the intake of alpha lipoic acid.', ""So we have no indication whether the intake of alpha lipoic acid by healthy people (from food, as a dietary supplement) can prevent Alzheimer's from breaking out at all.""]",1,"The sentences indicate that there is insufficient evidence to determine whether alpha lipoic acid can prevent or treat Alzheimer's disease, as existing studies do not provide conclusive results or recommendations.",It remains to be seen whether alpha lipoic acid can help prevent or delay the onset of Alzheimer's disease. There is also a lack of conclusive studies on the question of the extent to which the substance can favorably influence the course of a disease that has already broken out.
Are Vemma products good for health?,"['Quickly clarified There is no reason to believe that Vemma products have any health benefits; according to our research, they were only once the subject of a medical study – which, however, is completely unusable due to serious defects [1] Vemma, on the other hand, was often the subject of investigations, since the distribution system is very reminiscent of a pyramid game [b] [c].', 'However, the results are worthless for several reasons: there is no information on how the random assignment to the trial or placebo group happened, whether the blinding has kept, whether and how a blinding of the treating physicians has happened at all, the results contradict text and graphics and in the statistical analysis also serious errors have been made [1].']",1,"The sentences indicate that there is no credible evidence supporting the health benefits of Vemma products, highlighting serious flaws in the only medical study conducted and raising concerns about the company's distribution practices.","We have found only one study that investigates health effects of Vemma. However, the study is so flawed that it does not allow us to draw any conclusions."
Can dowsers find harmful soil zones or water veins?,"['Of three known studies in this direction, however, no supporting results are available.', 'One of these three studies was carried out according to strict scientific guidelines – it finds no connection between harmful zones and an influence on skin resistance [3].', 'In the three studies found [6] [7] [8], dowsing rodents could not find artificially laid water veins more frequently than chance allows.The results of the studies are more similar to those of a statistical random experiment – according to the motto: Every blind chicken finds a grain.', 'Furthermore, there were no large concordances of the randomly found water veins within or between the studies.']",2,"The studies indicate that dowsers could not reliably identify harmful soil zones or water veins, as their results were no better than chance and lacked consistency across experiments.",Small studies show that dowsing rods cannot detect water veins or hypothetical interference zones in the ground.
Does bioresonance therapy help with health complaints?,"['In this regard, the Commission refers primarily to physical opinions which allegedly show that the basic principles of bioresonance are incorrect [1], but also mentions three clinical studies which have shown ineffectiveness.', 'What to Know About Bioresonance There are no meaningful studies that certify efficacy of bioresonance, while two small clinical studies clearly speak against [7] [9].', 'The studies in detail The three studies already mentioned in the position name clearly show, on the one hand, that the method is not suitable for diagnosing allergies [8], on the other hand, they are only partly meaningful as a verification of efficacy – simply due to the low number of participants [7] [9].', 'Since 2006, some studies have been published, which allegedly speak for bioresonance, but most of them are scientifically worthless.']",2,"The provided sentences indicate that there is a lack of meaningful studies supporting the efficacy of bioresonance therapy, with several studies demonstrating its ineffectiveness, thereby suggesting that it does not help with health complaints.","Good studies on the question are hard to find. Due to the lack of proof of efficacy, the risk of misdiagnosis and the lack of plausibility, professional associations have been warning against bioresonance for some time."
Do irradiations with cold red light help with chronic gingivitis?,"['Few studies, no effect The few studies published so far indicate, however, that cold red light cannot effectively relieve such inflammations [1] [2] [3].', 'The fact that cold red light is intended to reduce pain after dental surgery can also not prove previous research results [4].', 'In none of these, the participating researchers were able to find an additional benefit of cold red light irradiation for the usual periodontitis treatment.', 'The summary analysis of existing studies does not indicate that cold red light can alleviate the consequences of dental surgery.']",2,"The provided sentences indicate that multiple studies have found no effective relief from chronic gingivitis through cold red light irradiation, suggesting that the claim is not supported by the existing research.",Previous studies indicate that chronic gingivitis and inflammation after dental surgery do not improve with irradiation with cold red light.
Does the Aspire system help you lose weight?,"['Whether this system leads to the desired weight loss, however, can not be said for sure at the present time.', 'However, it points to a strong effect: the study participants with the Aspire system lost an average of 21 kilograms in the first year, the comparison group only about 6 kilograms [1].', 'Patients with Aspire decreased an average of 21 kilograms in the first year, compared with about 6 kilograms in the comparative group.']",0,"The sentences indicate that while the Aspire system has shown significant weight loss in participants, it is uncertain if this outcome can be definitively attributed to the system itself.","Although there is only one small study on this, it shows a very large effect - which indicates that it is effective."
Can FLEXISEQ ointment relieve osteoarthritis pain?,"[""So the ointment FLEXISEQ would have to be compared to a placebo ointment – that hasn't happened yet; compared to a medication to be swallowed, a placebo to be swallowed, and an ointment with an active substance, but its effectiveness itself is not too clear."", 'So it is not sure whether the ointment helps better than a suitable placebo.', 'The study duration in the four individual studies described is a maximum of 12 weeks, so long-term effects have not yet been investigated.']",1,"The sentences indicate that there is insufficient evidence to determine whether FLEXISEQ ointment is more effective than a placebo or other treatments for relieving osteoarthritis pain, as the necessary comparative studies have not been conducted.",Comparisons to date with other commonly used treatments are difficult to interpret but do not yield clear evidence of efficacy.
Can butterbur prevent migraine attacks?,"['In summary, both studies show that it is twice as likely that the number of migraine attacks will halve after twelve weeks with the Pestwurz preparation compared to a dummy medication.', 'The above overviews are of different quality, but all come to the same conclusions due to the two same studies: Pestwurz can reduce the number of migraine attacks for some patients.']",0,"The sentences indicate that Pestwurz can reduce the number of migraine attacks for some patients, suggesting a potential benefit in preventing migraine attacks, but do not definitively confirm its effectiveness for all individuals.","Two well-done randomized-controlled trials show efficacy - the number of migraine attacks can probably be reduced with butterbur. Even if the effect is not huge, taking it may be worthwhile due to only minor side effects."
Does bisphenol A trigger allergies?,"['Hormone-like substances on the pill For BPA, the evidence of an allergy-promoting effect is currently not very strong.', 'The same study, which showed no correlation between the once measured BPA value in urine and existing allergies, found such association with the triclosan concentration in urine [2].']",1,"The sentences indicate that the evidence for bisphenol A promoting allergies is weak and that a study found no correlation between BPA levels in urine and existing allergies, suggesting insufficient support for the claim.","Individual observational studies suggest an association between bisphenol A intake and the development of asthma, but not allergy, in early childhood. Asthma is often the consequence of allergy. However, the measurement of bisphenol A intake in these studies is too imprecise for a clear statement."
Can maggots accelerate the healing of chronic wounds compared to conventional treatment?,"['Although the thorough cleansing of the wound is important for the healing process [2], there seems to be no indication that wounds heal faster after the maggot treatment [1].', 'Twelve months after the start of treatment, the number of subjects with healed chronic wounds in the maggot group was no greater than in patients with hydrogel associations.']",2,"The sentences indicate that maggot treatment does not lead to faster healing of chronic wounds compared to conventional methods, as evidenced by the lack of difference in healing rates between the maggot group and those receiving hydrogel treatment.","Maggot therapy may not heal chronic wounds any faster than conventional wound care. However, the maggots seem to be able to clean the wound of dead tissue more quickly - but also cause more pain."
Do electric toothbrushes protect oral health better than manual brushes?,"['After a thorough analysis of all the results, they have come to a clear conclusion: Yes, electric toothbrushes are actually better for oral hygiene – but the difference is not large [1].', 'The electric oral cleaning thus removes a trace better than hand toothbrushes.', 'If you brush your teeth electrically, you will also get a little less gingival inflammation than people who brush manually, according to the results of the analyzed studies.', 'The advantage of electric toothbrushes compared to conventional toothbrushes is small.']",0,"The sentences indicate that while electric toothbrushes are somewhat better for oral hygiene than manual brushes, the difference in effectiveness is minimal, suggesting that the claim is not strongly supported.",Electric toothbrushes probably combat plaque and bleeding gums slightly better than conventional manual toothbrushes.

Do antidepressants from the group of serotonin reuptake inhibitors help with depression?,"['Even if not all questions have been finally clarified around the SSRI group, the current study situation has revealed the following: SSRIs are effective.', ""SSRIs are not ‘happy pills', the effects achieved are rather moderate."", 'SSRI can be helpful in severe and probably also moderate depression.', 'In fact, the study situation with SSRI, as measured by its wide spread, was rather modest over a long period of time.']",0,"The sentences indicate that while SSRIs are effective and can be helpful for severe and moderate depression, their effects are described as moderate and the overall study situation has been modest, suggesting that the claim about their effectiveness in treating depression is not fully supported.","Serotonin reuptake inhibitors have been shown to be helpful in more severe depression, although the exact mechanisms are not clear. Overall, very strong or rapid effects are not expected. For milder depression, efficacy is more debatable. Sometimes patients have to try several SSRI preparations until they feel an improvement in symptoms, and some sufferers are not helped by the drugs at all. Well-done studies should help clarify the situation in the future so that more targeted treatment is possible."
Can topiramate reduce the frequency of migraine attacks?,"['The authors summarized the results of 17 studies and found that the number of headaches actually decreases – but only by one in 28 days.', '[1] The overview also shows positive effects on the overall quality of life, but only to a small extent and not quite without contradiction.', 'Although all studies go in the same direction and indicate the effectiveness of topiramate, despite the review work of Cochrane Collaboration, the evidence is low, also because there are other criticisms: The authors have several conflicts of interest and it is possible that studies with poor results have not been published (publication bias).', 'Little knowledge about chronic migraine In the expert recommendation on therapy and care for chronic migraine, two small studies are mentioned, according to which topiramate can also prevent in chronic migraine attacks [2].']",0,"The sentences indicate that while topiramate may reduce the frequency of migraine attacks, the evidence supporting its effectiveness is low and accompanied by potential biases, suggesting that the claim is not definitively supported.","Possibly yes. A review by the Cochrane Collaboration attests that topiramate slightly reduces the frequency of migraine attacks in adults, and in some patients the attacks even decrease significantly. Still, there are unanswered questions and the side effects should not be underestimated."
Does particulate matter pollution increase the risk of heart attack - even if the EU limits are complied with?,"['The study of over 367,000 adults from 13 European countries indicates that long-term exposure to particulate matter generally increases the risk of mortality – meaning life-saving [1].', ""The authors reported that long-term exposure to particulate matter at the place of residence makes the occurrence of heart attack and unstable angina pectoris ('heart', a sign of an imminent heart attack) more likely."", 'An English cohort study from 2013 could not deduce a link between heart attack risk and fine dust air pollution, but fine dust exposure increased the risks of other heart diseases.', 'The short-term inhalation of larger amounts of fine dust may also make a heart attack more likely.']",0,"The sentences indicate that long-term exposure to particulate matter is associated with an increased risk of heart attack, suggesting that even when EU limits are met, there may still be a heightened risk.","Recent studies from Europe indicate that everyday exposure to particulate matter may increase the risk of acute heart disease (myocardial infarction, angina pectoris). General mortality may also be increased already by 'allowed' long-term exposure within the current EU limits."
Are endocrine disruptors in cosmetics a health risk?,"['Thus, the risk for parabens is not demonstrated by clinical studies, especially not by cosmetics.', 'Many chemicals are not researched at all, the interaction with certain diseases is unknown and it is also not sufficiently clear when and how endocrine disruptors intervene in the physical development of adolescents [b].', 'Humans are therefore exposed to many such influences, which makes risk assessment very difficult.']",1,"The sentences indicate that while there is a lack of clinical studies demonstrating the risk of parabens in cosmetics, there is also uncertainty regarding the effects of many chemicals, making it difficult to assess the health risks posed by endocrine disruptors.","Although many cosmetics do indeed contain substances that can influence the hormone system, a health risk has not been proven. Ecological consequences, on the other hand, have already been demonstrated."
Do vitamin E supplements increase the likelihood of early death?,"['The result: more deaths occur in the vitamin E group than in the comparison group without vitamin supplements.', 'This meta-analysis also results in a slightly increased number of deaths due to vitamin E preparations.', 'This calculates an increased risk of premature death in vitamin E intake by three percent [2].']",0,"The sentences indicate that there is evidence of an increased number of deaths associated with vitamin E supplements, suggesting a potential link to early death.","Studies on this topic are very inconsistent. Nevertheless, there is a possibility that vitamin E increases the risk of death. A meta-analysis warns against high-dose vitamin preparations."
Does meditation help against stress?,"['Stress reduction in healthy people is shown, but not whether it is actually due to treatment.', 'A new review [3] summarizes 47 studies and brings better data – even if things remain complicated: Although some forms of meditation work against stress, only in comparison to control groups that receive no other targeted treatment.', 'The authors of an overview of mindfulness-based stress reduction [4] report in their summary that this form of therapy improves mental health, both in healthy people and in some patients with mental illnesses.', 'According to the systematic review work of 2014, not all types of meditation are equally effective: for mindfulness-based meditation, an effectiveness can be demonstrated, but not for transcendental meditation, in which the concentration of attention is sought to dissolve [3].']",0,"The sentences indicate that while some forms of meditation may reduce stress compared to control groups, the evidence is not definitive for all types of meditation, suggesting that the claim about meditation's effectiveness against stress is not fully supported.","Various forms of meditation seem to be able to alleviate stress both in healthy individuals and in people with mental illness. Studies on this are numerous, but the quality of the studies is consistently unsatisfactory."
Are there methods that effectively help against hormonal hair loss?,"['The efficacy of the active substance minoxidil is very well secured.', 'Regular use of a 2 or 3% minoxidil solution on the scalp may lead to cosmetically significant improvements in approximately three out of ten men affected [6].', 'Also in women with hormonal hair loss shows the treatment with Minoxidil effect.', 'Also scientifically well documented is the effect of finasteride [1] [2] [4] [5] [6].', 'There is evidence that the active substance can improve hormonal hair loss, as it intervenes in the hormone balance similar to finasteride.']",0,"The provided sentences discuss the effectiveness of minoxidil and finasteride in treating hormonal hair loss, indicating that these methods can lead to significant improvements for both men and women affected by this condition.","Besides own hair transplantation, the active substances finasteride or minoxidil (as a solution) can help, but both agents have side effects. The effectiveness of other means is hardly or not secured."
Does eye training help prevent myopia?,"['A systematic review did not find a controlled study in 2005 that could show an effect of eye training on shortsightedness – nor any that would suggest a preventive effect of eye training [1].', 'For other forms of falseness, there are also small and methodologically weak studies that find no difference between eye training and a control group [1].', 'But in most cases there is no evidence of the effect of visual training [1] [3].']",2,"The sentences indicate that systematic reviews and studies have found no evidence supporting the effectiveness of eye training in preventing myopia, directly refuting the claim.","According to the current state of studies, an effectiveness of eye training can only be expected for very few diseases; an effect as prevention or therapy against myopia cannot be assumed at present."
Does Cryolipolysis cause noticeable body fat reduction?,"['Whether the method can effectively reduce body fat cannot be said based on its results.', 'Whether the reason for the alleged figure improvements after three to six or twelve months was actually the cold treatment, however, can not be determined by previous-after-comparisons without an untreated control group anyway.', 'Even if the authors of previously published studies conjure the effectiveness of cryolipolysis – this cannot be objectively assessed on the basis of their results.']",1,The sentences indicate that the effectiveness of cryolipolysis in reducing body fat cannot be conclusively determined due to the lack of control groups and objective assessments in previous studies.,"The effectiveness of cryolipolysis cannot be assessed objectively, as there are no scientific efficacy studies on it."
Can Internet-based self-help training based on cognitive behavioral therapy reduce the burden of tinnitus?,"['Accordingly, the authors of a systematic review of Cochrane Collaboration [ 1 ] found strong evidence that cognitive behavioral therapy can lead to a noticeable improvement in the quality of life despite persistent tinnitus.', 'In addition, the therapy can lead to a low relief of depressive moods, which suffer from numerous tinnitus patients.', 'The self-help training developed at Linköping University in Sweden is a version of an already proven cognitive behavioral therapy program for tinnitus patients adapted to the Internet.', 'But also a newly developed Internet program to increase tinnitus acceptance with the help of mindfulness-based strategies proved equally effective.', 'Summary It seems likely that cognitive therapies for tinnitus management not only bring improvement in traditional group sessions, but also in the form of Internet-based self-help training programs.']",0,"The sentences indicate that cognitive behavioral therapy, including Internet-based self-help training, has shown strong evidence of improving quality of life for tinnitus patients, suggesting that such programs can effectively reduce the burden of tinnitus.","Cognitive behavioral therapy can noticeably improve the quality of life and depressiveness of tinnitus sufferers. Internet-based self-help training based on cognitive behavioral therapy could be similarly helpful, but is often discontinued by sufferers."
Do probiotic foods have an antidepressant effect or a positive effect on the mind?,"['The study referred to in oe24.at [1] cannot answer the question whether probiotic foods improve the mood.', 'The scientists do not indicate whether the probiotically treated subjects were already less depressed and anxious before the start of the experiment than those who did not receive a probiotic product.']",1,"The sentences indicate that the study does not provide evidence to determine whether probiotic foods have a positive effect on mood, as it does not clarify the initial mental health status of the subjects involved.","Whether probiotics can help with depression or have a positive effect on the mood has never been investigated in clinical trials.

Is tick-borne tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) much milder in children than in adults?,"['Although only 20 children participated in this study, there is a certain trend: young patients generally had less severe symptoms and recovered faster than adults.', 'Except for one case of complete vaccination and two cases of incomplete vaccination, the affected children were unvaccinated [11] and more frequently developed meningitis, while adults were more likely to fight with the more dangerous inflammation of the brain and cerebral membranes (meningo-encephalitis).']",0,"The sentences indicate that children generally had less severe symptoms and recovered faster than adults, suggesting that tick-borne encephalitis may be milder in children, but they also experienced more frequent cases of meningitis compared to adults, who faced more severe complications.","Current studies suggest that TBE is probably associated with milder symptoms in children than in adults. Permanent damage is also less frequent in younger patients. However, TBE can also have severe health consequences in children in individual cases."
"Does treatment with cyanoacrylate (for example, Sapheon Venaseal™) help against varicose veins as well or better than other methods?","['There are other scientific studies to close varicose veins with cyanoacrylate, but these do not meet current scientific requirements.', 'However, the efficacy cannot be assessed precisely, since the study authors had not compared their method to another treatment or sham treatment.', 'How good the method is compared to other methods has not been adequately studied [7].']",1,"The sentences indicate that while there are studies on cyanoacrylate for treating varicose veins, they lack adequate comparisons to other treatments, making it unclear how effective this method is relative to alternatives.","To date, there are no results from clinical studies on this method.

Is aluminum intake responsible for the development of Alzheimer's disease?,"['Cause unknown As far as the cause of pathological memory loss is concerned, research is still relatively in the dark.', ""However, due to the implementation of the study, it cannot be concluded that small traces of aluminium are actually the triggering cause of Alzheimer's disease.""]",1,"The sentences indicate that while the cause of Alzheimer's disease is still unclear, they do not support the idea that aluminum intake is definitively responsible for its development.","Scientific studies cannot prove with certainty a connection between the metal aluminum and the disease Alzheimer, but they cannot exclude it either."
Can regular exercise prevent or relieve migraine symptoms?,"['In a systematic overview from 2008 [ 2 ] of 7 studies with very low participation numbers, the authors conclude that sporting activity can probably lead to a slight reduction in the pain intensity of further migraine attacks.', 'A randomized-controlled study [ 3 ] in 30 migraine patients found at least a small reduction in the pain intensity of future migraine seizures for a combination program of aerobic training followed by muscle relaxation.', 'In another, less rigorous study [ 4 ] in 16 patients, compared to migraine patients who did not participate in any sports program, there was also a small reduction in pain intensity.', 'In a recent study from 2009 [ 5 ], the scientists found a similar improvement in the frequency of monthly migraine attacks.', 'Too little comprehensive investigations for clear effect In summary, a certain effectiveness of regularly operated endurance sports such as jogging or cycling for prevention of migraine attacks seems likely.']",0,"The sentences indicate that while there is some evidence suggesting that regular exercise may lead to a slight reduction in migraine pain intensity and frequency, the overall findings are inconclusive due to the limited number and rigor of studies.","In some, but not all, studies, regular exercise seems to at least somewhat reduce the pain intensity of future migraine attacks. Whether the frequency of migraine attacks can also be reduced cannot be assessed with certainty. for this, larger, better validated studies would have to be conducted."
Does less than 7h of sleep daily increase mental performance?,"['Already six hours of sleep reduce brain performance The results of a small randomized-controlled study [1] clearly contradict the claim of performance-enhancing sleep loss.', 'After only a few nights it became apparent: the shorter the participants could sleep at night, the worse they did in the tests compared to the group with eight hours of sleep.', 'The performance of the sleep deficit group was significantly worse after five days compared to the control group, although the impact is limited by the small size of the control group.', 'This shows that lack of sleep actually seemed to be the cause of the worse mental performance.', 'Overall, if you sleep only six or less hours per night, you will hardly be wiser, but it seems to impair your mental performance.']",2,"The provided sentences indicate that sleeping less than seven hours negatively impacts mental performance, as evidenced by studies showing worse test results and cognitive decline in participants with reduced sleep.",Two small randomized-controlled studies indicate that mental performance decreases with the number of sleepless hours per night and the number of nights with insufficient sleep. No single scientific study provides evidence of an increase in mental performance due to shorter sleep duration.
Does regular intake of extra virgin olive oil protect against coronary heart disease such as heart attack?,"['Probably related to reduced risk of heart attack Many research groups have already studied the question of whether olive oil can actually reduce the risk of heart attacks and other heart diseases over the last two decades.', 'When eating more than 30 grams of olive oil per day, the risk of heart disease was only about half as high as in people who consumed less than 15 grams per day or no olive oil at all.', 'The olive oil-rich diet resulted in a significant reduction in the risk of heart attack and death for almost five years by just under a third compared to a conventional diet.', 'Study participants with high olive oil consumption were significantly less likely to be found in the group of heart attack patients, the scientists therefore concluded that the oil had a significant protective effect.', 'The results of the two most reliable and largest cohort studies [ 2, 3 ] indicate a likely protective effect of increased consumption of cold-pressed olive oil over several years.']",0,"The provided sentences collectively indicate that regular intake of extra virgin olive oil is associated with a reduced risk of heart attack and coronary heart disease, suggesting a protective effect.","Regular consumption of cold-pressed olive oil may possibly prevent coronary heart disease.

Do frequent ejaculations have a protective effect against prostate cancer?,"['Result: Men with frequent ejaculations between 20 and 30 years of age have a one-third reduced prostate cancer risk compared to those with rare ejaculations [1].', ""Taking the result seriously, it doesn't show that much self-satisfaction protects, but rather that men with very few ejaculations could have a slightly higher risk of prostate cancer."", 'Here it turns out that frequent ejaculations from the age of four years onwards or over the entire life span may reduce the risk of prostate cancer [3].', 'In sum, the study provides evidence that with increasing ejaculation frequency, the risk of prostate cancer could actually decrease.']",0,"The sentences indicate that frequent ejaculations may be associated with a reduced risk of prostate cancer, suggesting a potential protective effect, but they also imply that the relationship is not definitively established and could be influenced by other factors.","A cohort study suggests that more frequent ejaculations starting at age 40, or over a lifetime, could potentially lower the risk of prostate cancer. This is not exclusive to ejaculations from masturbation, but from any sexual activity."
Does condom use cause depression in women?,"['Like any contraceptive method, the condom has disadvantages that it causes depression in women, but is nowhere documented.', 'Maybe less fun We have not found a study that specifically investigated whether the use of condoms in sex can lead to depression in women.', 'If condoms were to promote depression, it would be unlikely that depression would decrease if used more frequently.', 'They have found no correlations between condom use and depression [4].', 'Risk factors for depression In any case, condoms cannot be found in the list of recognised risk factors.']",1,"The sentences indicate that there is no documented evidence or studies linking condom use to depression in women, suggesting that the claim lacks sufficient support.",A study examining exactly this question was not found.

Do today's children have a shorter life expectancy than their parents?,"['Overweight leads to a higher rate of premature deaths – which reduces life expectancy on average by 3 to 9 months.', 'So it would be a reversal of the trend: for the first time in a long time, children would have a life expectancy less than their parents.', 'There are some reasons to assume that it will be worse than the 3 to 9 months less: Obesity is becoming more common and occurs in increasingly younger children [1].', 'If this trend continues, there may be a reduction in life expectancy of three to five years.']",0,"The sentences indicate that due to rising obesity rates among children, there is a possibility that today's children may have a shorter life expectancy than their parents, suggesting a concerning trend that could lead to a significant reduction in life expectancy.","Obesity and physical inactivity are increasing risk factors worldwide that can shorten life. In 2005, a study from the USA concluded that life expectancy could be reduced by 3 to 9 months when these risks were included."
Does training on vibration platforms cause a noticeable buildup of muscle strength?,"['Therefore, training on vibration platforms could actually strengthen the muscle strength of the leg muscles.', 'However, compared to conventional strengthening training, the results do not indicate superiority of vibration platforms.', 'According to the results of this study, it could be concluded at most that training on a vibration platform in combination with a diet can lead to weight loss, which could also be achieved by a conventional fitness program or a mere diet without exercise program.']",0,"The sentences indicate that while training on vibration platforms may strengthen leg muscles, it does not show superiority over conventional training methods, suggesting that the claim about noticeable muscle strength buildup is not conclusively supported.","Vibration training may be helpful for building muscle strength in the legs, but it is not better than conventional training for this purpose. Whether the method is also suitable for weight reduction has not been sufficiently studied."
Can apigenin reduce cancer risk or prevent cancer progression?,"['On the other hand, a laboratory study [5] found that apigenin might inhibit the effect of chemotherapy treatments.', 'However, when treated with apigenin, the cancer cells became resistant to this drug and did not die.', 'Apigenine without influence on cancer risk What applies in small cases could also apply in large cases.', 'This showed that those participants who had eaten the most apigenine with food were not less likely to have cancer than other women in the study.', 'Unefficacious and possibly risky Apart from laboratory findings, previous observational studies show that the potential protective effect of apigenin is not able to significantly reduce the risk of cancer in normal diets [8].']",2,"The provided sentences indicate that apigenin does not significantly reduce cancer risk and may even lead to resistance in cancer cells, suggesting that it is unlikely to prevent cancer progression.","Studies suggest that even high levels of apigenin in food do not protect against cancer. In individual cases, it is suspected that apigenin in high amounts could weaken the effect of chemotherapy or even accelerate cancer growth."
Do generic drugs work as well as original drugs?,"['Results & Interpretation In a review of 7 individual studies [1] published in 2010, three active substances against epilepsy were compared with generic drugs, with no evidence of an increased probability of seizures.', 'For none of the active substances studied, there was evidence of a lower efficacy of the generic medicinal product.', 'Based on the studies published so far, there is no evidence of inferiority of generic medicinal products compared to original medicinal products.']",0,"The sentences indicate that studies show no evidence of lower efficacy or inferiority of generic drugs compared to original drugs, supporting the claim that generic drugs work as well as original drugs.","Yes, the summarized results of clinical studies do not provide any evidence for a poorer efficacy of generics compared to originator drugs.

Does light freezing help with weight loss?,"['Much speculation, little knowledge A scientific work taken up by many media does not help with this question [1].', 'Nevertheless, weight loss was not significantly higher than after the same exercise program at more pleasant temperatures.']",1,"The sentences indicate that there is little scientific knowledge supporting the claim about light freezing aiding weight loss, and they also suggest that weight loss results are not significantly improved compared to exercising in more comfortable temperatures.","Some laboratory studies show that the body reacts to colder temperatures with higher energy consumption and burns more fat. Nevertheless, it is completely unclear whether this supports weight loss; that is, whether the process is strong enough and whether other mechanisms do not work against it. Weight loss through freezing has not been investigated in clinical studies."
Do earrings cause discomfort by destroying acupuncture points or meridians?,"['However, we could not find any studies that would have investigated earrings and their effects on meridians or acupuncture points.']",1,The absence of studies investigating the effects of earrings on meridians or acupuncture points suggests that there is insufficient evidence to support the claim that earrings cause discomfort by destroying these points.,"Earrings very often lead to complications, fortunately most of them are harmless.

Do milk or dairy products promote colon cancer and rectal cancer?,"['For ovarian cancer, breast cancer and cancer of the uterine mucosa, the authors of extensive systematic reviews have so far found no evidence of a reduction in risk or an increase in risk [3] [4] [5].', 'However, the study situation is still too unclear to draw definitive conclusions, which requires more and more meaningful studies.', 'There is also the possibility that dairy products will reduce the likelihood of bladder cancer.']",2,"The provided sentences discuss various cancers but do not address the relationship between milk or dairy products and colon or rectal cancer, leaving the claim unaddressed.","It is likely that dairy products reduce the risk of colon and rectal cancer, and possibly bladder cancer. However, very large amounts of milk & dairy products could possibly increase the risk of prostate cancer. It should be remembered that about the same number of men die from colon and rectal cancer as from prostate cancer. For breast and ovarian cancer and cancer of the endometrium, it is unclear whether cancer risk is affected by milk and dairy products."
Does yoga change the genetic makeup?,"['The genes themselves remain unchanged, only their activity fluctuates; just as in each cell the activity of the different genes is adjusted according to current needs.', 'The difference between a liver cell and a muscle cell is not due to different genes, but to different gene activity.', 'The study shows that shortly after the activity, the gene activity differs from certain white blood cells in these two groups.']",1,"The sentences indicate that while gene activity can change, the genes themselves do not alter, suggesting that yoga does not change the genetic makeup itself.",Yoga - like any other physical activity - can influence the activity of genes. But the genes themselves are not changed by it.
"Can electromagnetic fields with a specific pattern (pulsed electromagnetic fields, PEMF) heal injuries?","['Evidence that this pattern in particular has a good therapeutic effect has not been provided.', 'In fact, only a randomized-controlled study on fatigue in multiple sclerosis (MS) [1] and some laboratory results can be found.', 'Apart from the fact that a study on fatigue in a particular disease naturally does not say anything about effects on completely different symptoms, this one study is not yet meaningful: there were very few participants (37) and the intake of medications differed in the experimental and control groups.', 'Many approaches, little evidence Even if the whole variety of similar treatments is considered, there are not enough good studies to prove an effect of PEMF therapies.', 'For a meaningful assessment of PEMF as a form of therapy, studies with good methodology, a higher number of participants and a comparison of the different forms of application (among others) are missing.']",1,"The sentences indicate that there is insufficient evidence to support the claim that pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMF) can heal injuries, as existing studies are limited in scope and methodology.","No good injury studies can be found on the device. The only randomized-controlled study treats fatigue in patients with the incurable nerve disease multiple sclerosis and is not very conclusive. Even for the whole range of similar treatment methods, there is no sufficient evidence of efficacy."
Does the drug fingolimod reduce the progression of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis similarly or better than previous drugs?,"['The recently newly approved active substance Fingolimod in Europe causes white blood cells (T cells) to be held back in the lymph nodes, which prevents them from causing inflammation by immigrating to the brain.', 'By means of systematic literature research, we wanted to find out whether fingolimod is similar to or better than previous multiple sclerosis – drugs can inhibit the progression of the disease.']",0,"The sentences describe the mechanism of action of fingolimod and indicate an intention to compare its efficacy to previous drugs, but they do not provide direct evidence or results regarding its effectiveness in reducing disease progression compared to those drugs.","Two manufacturer-funded clinical trials attest Fingolimod such efficacy that exceeds that of interferon beta therapy. However, the drug can also cause serious side effects."
Can cancer be successfully fought with intentionally induced fever?,"['==References== In the 19th century, the idea was born that fevers protect against cancer.', 'No major modern studies have been conducted in which deliberately triggered fever has been tested as therapy.']",1,"The sentences indicate that while there is historical interest in the idea that fevers may protect against cancer, there is a lack of modern studies testing intentionally induced fever as a therapeutic approach, leaving the claim unverified.","In the early 20th century, cancer was indeed sometimes fought with fever, sometimes successfully. But the therapies and trials are poorly documented and were risky. An assessment of efficacy is not possible based on the studies to date."
Can some forms of headache be successfully treated with heat?,"['Accordingly, there is no scientific evidence of the effectiveness of this measure.', 'However, there is no sufficient evidence to support this claim.', 'A Cochrane overview work from 2004 [1] investigates all non-invasive physical treatment methods for all forms of headache: Heat treatment plays only a very small role according to this study (dryer is not mentioned) – heat was tested in combination with other measures: In one study, the combination of heat, home training and stretching is worse than a combination of biofeedback and relaxation.']",1,"The sentences indicate a lack of scientific evidence supporting the effectiveness of heat treatment for headaches, suggesting that the claim may not be substantiated.","Heat on tense muscles is pleasant, but no evidence exists that the tension is released and the headache is relieved."
Does treatment with the new drug erenumab reduce the number of migraine days per month?,"['In other words, compared to a sham medication, individuals with episodic migraines were spared on average 1 to 2 migraine days per month by erenumab [1-4].', 'So far no serious side effects The side effects of erenumab – as far as the earlier rather shorter studies at least – do not seem to be serious: those who used erenumab complained a little more frequently than those with the dummy medication about injection site reactions, constipation, muscle cramps and itching [6].', 'Because erenumab has so far only been compared with placebo.', 'No long-term data The results on efficacy and safety first sound as if people with a similar condition as in the studies could actually benefit from erenumab.']",0,"The sentences indicate that erenumab reduces migraine days by 1 to 2 per month compared to a sham medication, but they also highlight the lack of long-term data and serious side effects, suggesting that while there is some evidence of efficacy, it is not comprehensive.","In five studies available to date, which tend to be shorter, participants suffered from migraine less frequently with erenumab than with a placebo. The studies were of high methodological quality. In episodic migraine, people ""saved"" about 1 to 2 migraine days per month . For chronic migraine, sufferers had about 2.5 fewer days of pain per month. However, the efficacy and safety data relate to a maximum time frame of six months; the long-term benefit still needs to be explored. The benefit of erenumab compared to other established preventive migraine drugs has also not yet been researched."
Is screening by optical coherence tomography superior to conventional examinations for the early detection of diabetic macular edema?,"['Early detection: Optical coherence tomography unreliable Most diabetes patients with such pathological retinal damage will not notice symptoms such as dark spots in the field of vision or impairment of sharp vision long after the start.', 'However, laser treatment is not without risk, in some cases it may also result in an unwanted reduction in vision or other side effects that affect vision.']",2,"The sentences indicate that optical coherence tomography is unreliable for early detection of diabetic macular edema, suggesting that it may not be superior to conventional examinations.","No, screening by optical coherence tomography alone is too inaccurate. An examination using an ophthalmoscope and pupil dilating eye drops or with the help of fundus photography is a safer method."
Does the treatment of diabetes-related retinal diseases by injection of VEGF inhibitors provide an advantage compared to conventional laser treatment?,"['The majority (5 out of 100 inhabitants) suffer from type 2 diabetes (formerly also called age diabetes), which is practically always lifestyle-related and in most cases is accompanied by overweight, one-sided diet and lack of exercise [ 4 ].', 'The presentation of the effectiveness of VEGF inhibitor injections as a new treatment method is also clearly exaggerated and biased – the newspaper article does not inform about risks and uncertainties.']",0,"The sentences highlight that the effectiveness of VEGF inhibitor injections is exaggerated and do not address the risks, suggesting that the claim about their advantage over conventional laser treatment lacks sufficient support.","There is evidence of better short-term efficacy for VEGF inhibitor injections compared with laser coagulation, but the method is insufficiently studied. Whether the effect is safe in the long term and effective at the same time is unclear."
Do saw palmetto preparations help with benign prostate enlargement?,"['[4] [7] A well substantiated statement can only be made for saw palm preparations: A data analysis published in 2012 shows that these remedies do not work better than placebos and are therefore ineffective.', 'However, it might be useful to continue to follow certain indications of symptom-improving plants and to compare them with new studies – at least in older studies, extracts of the African plum tree, willow grass pollen and the plant ingredient beta-sitosterin were considered safe and possibly effective.', '[updated and supplemented on March 1, 2015 with details on saw palm extracts, beta sitosterol, extracts of the African plum tree and willow grass pollen extract] ( Author: J.
