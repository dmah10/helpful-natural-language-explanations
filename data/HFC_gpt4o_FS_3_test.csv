Can monk's pepper reduce PMS symptoms? PMS is the abbreviation for premenstrual syndrome. This refers to complaints that occur in the days before menstruation.,"['Reference to efficacy in PMS According to previous studies, monk peppers could actually help in PMS.', 'The summarized study results indicate that the symptoms with monk pepper are reduced in more patients than with a sham medication (placebo).', 'Therefore, it would be possible for monk peppers to act against PMS symptoms such as breast spacing.']",0,"Monk peppers have been shown in previous studies to potentially alleviate PMS symptoms more effectively than a placebo, suggesting a possible benefit for those experiencing premenstrual syndrome.","In the studies to date, monk's pepper seems to relieve PMS symptoms better than a placebo. However, this is not well proven, because the studies have significant weaknesses. There is no evidence of an effect on menstrual disorders. Significant studies are lacking."
Can CBD (cannabidiol) help with migraines or other headaches?,"['Apparently, CBD has never been investigated to see if it can help with migraine seizures.', 'The claim that CBD would help with migraines or headaches is pure speculation.', 'The studies in detail Despite extensive search in three databases, we could not find any studies on CBD against migraine or other types of headache, neither for treatment nor for prevention.']",1,The lack of studies investigating the effects of CBD on migraines or headaches indicates that there is insufficient evidence to support the claim that CBD can help with these conditions.,There are no studies that have investigated the effectiveness of CBD against migraine. So claims that CBD can help with or prevent migraine attacks have no scientific basis. The same is true for other types of headache.
Can ginkgo extract improve mental performance in dementia patients?,"['Dementia patients taking Ginkgo extract often seemed to perform better in thinking, memory, and concentration tasks than those who swallowed placebo preparations without an active substance [1.3].', 'Although the studies indicate that Ginkgo extract can help people with dementia, the significance of the individual studies is limited.']",0,"The sentences indicate that while some dementia patients taking Ginkgo extract appeared to perform better in cognitive tasks compared to those on a placebo, the overall significance of the studies is limited, suggesting that the claim lacks strong support.",Previous studies suggest that ginkgo extract can improve mental performance in dementia - but this is not well established. It is not possible to say exactly how large this effect is.
Do green-lipped mussel preparations improve the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis?,"['For us, therefore, this claim is not credible.', 'Whether green-lipped mussel helps with rheumatism or not, can therefore not be said for sure at the moment.', 'Whether the results can be transferred to other products or other dosages is unclear.', ""The studies are all badly done according to today's standard: so it is unclear how reliable the measurements of the treatment success are."", 'Whether rheumatism patients would still benefit from green-lipped mussel preparations remains unclear.']",1,"The claim regarding the effectiveness of green-lipped mussel preparations for rheumatoid arthritis is undermined by the lack of credible studies and unclear results, indicating that it cannot be definitively confirmed or denied at this time.","Five small studies provide no overall evidence of benefit from green-lipped mussel in rheumatism. However, the rheumatism treatment of the participants does not meet today's standards and the studies were very poorly conducted. Therefore, we cannot draw any reliable conclusions from these studies."
Can low-level laser therapy reduce wrist osteoarthritis pain?,"['There is a well-made study on wrist arthritis: it showed no difference in efficacy between low-level laser therapy and placebo treatment.', 'This was not the case, the laser treatment could not relieve the pain better than placebo treatment.']",2,The provided sentences indicate that low-level laser therapy did not demonstrate any significant pain relief for wrist osteoarthritis compared to placebo treatment.,"In the pain treatment of wrist osteoarthritis, no efficacy can be assumed - this is indicated by the results of a small but well-done study. Research results on knee osteoarthritis are contradictory and therefore of little significance. We did not find any reliable studies on hip osteoarthritis."
"Does taking polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as omega-3 and omega-6, reduce ADHD symptoms in children?","['Overall, the preparations do not seem to make children with ADHD quieter and more concentrated.', 'Whether omega fatty acid preparations or placebo, all children showed similarly strong ADHD symptoms.', 'On closer examination, it appears that the best-performed, blinded studies show no or even a negative effect of the omega fatty acid preparations on the behaviour of the participating children.']",2,"The provided sentences indicate that omega fatty acid preparations do not improve ADHD symptoms in children, with studies showing no significant difference between those taking the supplements and those receiving a placebo.","Studies to date suggest that supplements containing polyunsaturated fatty acids (for example, omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids) tend not to have a noticeable effect on attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, the quality of the studies is not sufficient to provide definitive answers."
"Can ozone therapy, in which autologous blood is treated with ozone and recycled, favorably influence the course of COVID-19 disease?","['There are no differences between standard treatment and additional ozone therapy â€“ neither in the progression of Covid-19 disease nor in the risk of death.', 'An advantage for ozone therapy did not arise, for none of the comparisons there was a clear difference: neither for the risk of death to Covid-19 nor for the course of the disease [5].', 'Thus, the sole effect of autologous ozone therapy has not been established here either.']",1,"The provided sentences indicate that there are no significant differences in the progression of COVID-19 or the risk of death between standard treatment and additional ozone therapy, suggesting that ozone therapy does not favorably influence the course of the disease.",The few studies on this subject have gross deficiencies and are therefore not conclusive. Their results do not provide any evidence of efficacy of ozone therapy.
Does dimenhydrinate relieve travel nausea better than a placebo?,"['However, we are very sceptical here: we consider the results to be so little meaningful that we can neither see any evidence of effectiveness nor exclude it.', 'In general, it remains questionable how reliable the results can be transferred to other situations where travel sickness occurs.', 'However, we do not consider this assessment to be meaningful: the number of test subjects was far too small, and, therefore, the fluctuation range was far too large.']",1,"The sentences express skepticism about the effectiveness of dimenhydrinate for travel nausea, highlighting issues with the reliability of the results and the small sample size, which undermines the claim.","The best available studies on the subject are unfortunately not conclusive, for example because they were quite small and the publications lack many details for traceability.  Therefore, we can neither prove nor exclude an effect."
Does dimenhydrinate relieve travel nausea as well as the proven drug scopolamine???,"['According to study authors, dimenhydrinate is supposed to help better than a placebo but has a worse effect than the proven drug Scopolamine.']",1,"Dimenhydrinate is indicated to be more effective than a placebo but less effective than scopolamine, suggesting it does not relieve travel nausea as well as the proven drug.","The best available studies on the subject are unfortunately not conclusive, for example because they were quite small and the publications lack many details for traceability.  Therefore, we can neither prove nor exclude an effect."
Does short-term fasting reduce the side effects of chemotherapy for cancer???,"['On this basis, we cannot reliably say whether fasting during chemotherapy is actually useful or not, thus reducing side effects and improving the quality of life.', 'Whether fasting prevents or mitigates the side effects of chemotherapy is also not clear from the results: In one of the studies [1a] there was no difference in side effects such as fatigue or nerve pain: they were similarly common and similarly severe in both groups.', 'All of this means that the results of the studies are extremely uncertain and we cannot see or exclude the effectiveness of fasting.']",1,"The provided sentences indicate that the effectiveness of short-term fasting in reducing chemotherapy side effects remains uncertain, as studies show no clear benefits or differences in side effects between fasting and non-fasting groups.",We found only three very small studies on both questions. Their results are so unreliable that we cannot make any assessment. So we cannot say whether the quality of life of those affected is improved and whether fasting during chemotherapy reduces side effects.
Are extracts of Artemisa annua (annual mugwort) or the active ingredient artemisinin obtained from it effective against coronavirus?,"['We have not found any studies to prevent Corona infection.', 'However, it has several inconsistencies, so it cannot answer whether Artemisia helps the sick.', 'However, the limited anti-malaria effect of artemisinin does not indicate efficacy against other diseases.', 'For several reasons, we do not consider these results to be reliable: The standard treatment differed greatly: some of the participants received, for example, cortisone-containing drugs that are known to be effective, while others did not.']",1,"The sentences indicate a lack of studies demonstrating the effectiveness of Artemisia annua or artemisinin against coronavirus, highlighting inconsistencies and the limited anti-malaria effect of artemisinin, which does not imply efficacy for other diseases.","To date, only one study can be found that investigated Artemisia treatment in mild covid-19 progression. However, due to numerous shortcomings, the results are not conclusive. It has not been studied whether Artemisia helps or prevents severe covid 19 disease or whether the plant can prevent coronavirus infection."
Can zinc mitigate the progression of Covid-19?,"['Thus zinc should not cause Covid-19 sufferers to get better more quickly [3].', 'However, compared to the other half that did not take zinc, they did not recover faster.', 'So these results suggest that zinc treatment at Covid-19 is not helpful.']",2,"The sentences indicate that zinc treatment does not lead to faster recovery for Covid-19 sufferers compared to those who did not take zinc, suggesting that zinc may not be effective in mitigating the progression of Covid-19.",The results of two studies on this suggest that sufferers with Covid-19 do not recover more quickly with zinc than without. A preventive effect has not yet been investigated in studies.
Does a cold spray with trypsin protect against colds or covid-19? Does the spray reduce symptoms and duration of illness?,"['No previously published study has investigated whether the cold spray can prevent a disease.', 'Thus, it is not certain that the cold spray shortens the duration of a cold.', 'If you look at the number of people who report cold complaints after artificial infection (21 out of 23 in the spray group, 16 out of 23 in the placebo group), there is no clear difference that speaks for a preventive effect of the cold spray.', 'Therefore, we do not consider the results of the study meaningful: With spray, the participants assessed the duration of their cold shorter (7.7 days) than without spray (10.4 days).', 'Interestingly, there was no clear difference between the two groups: The spray group did not reach much less to other colds than the control group.']",1,"The provided sentences indicate that there is no conclusive evidence that the cold spray with trypsin can prevent colds or COVID-19, nor is there a clear indication that it reduces symptoms or the duration of illness.",The question was investigated in two small studies with gross deficiencies. They cannot prove that treatment with the cold spray relieves symptoms or shortens the duration of illness. Whether the spray has a preventive effect has not been researched for either colds or Covid-19.
"Does injecting low-dose Corona vaccine into the skin (mesotherapy vaccination, microvaccination) protect against Covid-19 as well as proven full-dose vaccination into muscle?","['Whether the mesotherapy vaccination against the coronavirus protects against a covid-19 disease is not researched.', 'Whether Corona vaccination by mesotherapy provides effective protection against Covid-19 remains unclear.']",1,"The sentences indicate that there is no research or clarity on the effectiveness of mesotherapy vaccination against Covid-19, leaving the claim about its protective capability unverified.","Some doctors offer corona vaccination using the so-called mesotherapeutic method. Here, vaccination is administered into the skin instead of into the upper arm muscle, with a fraction of the tested and approved dose. Such applications have not been explored for the Corona vaccines. Effective protection against Covid-19 is not assured."
Do herbal remedies with nasturtium and horseradish (Kren) prevent recurrent cystitis?,"['In the prevention study, it can be seen that the herbal product and the sham medication did not differ significantly in the case of symptoms such as nausea or allergic reactions [1].', 'According to this, the capuchin cress-meerrettiche preparation probably does not offer any preventive protection.']",2,"The sentences indicate that the herbal preparation containing nasturtium and horseradish likely does not provide any preventive protection against recurrent cystitis, suggesting that the claim is not supported.","As for prevention, we have found only one small but somewhat reliable study. According to this, nasturtium-horseradish remedies probably cannot prevent cystitis. For the treatment of cystitis, we were also only able to evaluate one study. However, it leaves too many questions unanswered to be able to clearly assess its effectiveness."
Can homeopathic remedies relieve colds in children??,"['Children who regularly took homeopathic medicines were not less likely to become ill in the meaningful studies and their colds were not milder.', 'The few well-executed studies clearly showed no effect of homeopathy against colds.']",2,"The sentences indicate that children who took homeopathic medicines did not experience fewer or milder colds, and well-executed studies demonstrated no effect of homeopathy against colds, directly contradicting the claim.","Well-done studies find neither a preventive nor an alleviating effect of homeopathy on children's colds (chills). However, these studies have examined too few children for a truly conclusive result. Larger studies would be needed for a clear answer.  It is not scientifically plausible that homeopathic remedies are effective."
Can treatments with ultrasound relieve the pain of osteoarthritis?,"['In three studies [3-5], there was no clear benefit from the treatment in the ultrasound group.', '[2] Many promises, little behind osteoarthritis can greatly affect the quality of life.', 'The summary of the different study results, although purely mathematically, indicated that ultrasound as therapy has no analgesic effect.', 'Therefore, better studies must clarify the potential efficacy of ultrasound therapy against osteoarthritis pain.']",1,"The provided sentences indicate that multiple studies found no clear benefit from ultrasound treatment for osteoarthritis pain, suggesting a lack of evidence for its efficacy.","A number of studies have investigated whether ultrasound can help with osteoarthritis of the knee joints. However, their results are not conclusive; the study results are too contradictory to make a definite statement. For osteoarthritis of the hip or hands, this has not been investigated at all."
Does regular exercise reduce the severity and duration of colds and other respiratory infections?,"['However, the studies indicate that regular exercise can reduce the duration and severity of respiratory infections.', 'Thus, regular exercise increases life expectancy and reduces, among other things, the risk of cardiovascular diseases such as heart attack or stroke diabetes cancer depression.', 'The studies suggest that although the number of infections can not be reduced by sport, it may be a little milder for the duration of the disease and for the duration of the disease as a whole.']",0,"Regular exercise is indicated to potentially lessen the severity and duration of respiratory infections, although it may not significantly reduce the overall number of infections.","Previous studies suggest that sports-playing people may be just as likely to have respiratory infections as sports-muffle people. However, the illnesses are likely to be somewhat less severe and a bit shorter overall."
"Can cold showers, cold baths or cold water treading according to Kneipp prevent colds and respiratory infections in adults?","['After evaluating the best available studies, we have come to the conclusion that the question is simply not well enough to speak out for or against effectiveness.', 'These studies, too, cannot demonstrate or exclude any effect.']",1,"The available studies do not provide sufficient evidence to confirm or deny the effectiveness of cold showers, baths, or water treading in preventing colds and respiratory infections in adults.",The three studies conducted to date are too deficient to answer this question.
"Can filtering out blue light using blue filter glasses or night mode settings on smartphone, tablet or laptop screens have a beneficial effect on sleep?","['With activated blue filter night mode or blue filter glasses, the participants took a similar amount of time to fall asleep as without blue filter.', ""Perhaps the amount of blue light on tablets, smartphones, ebook readers or laptop screens is not enough to disturb the body's own melatonin production."", 'The overall study situation now indicates that blue light from screen devices has no influence on sleep.']",2,"The provided sentences indicate that blue light from screen devices does not significantly affect sleep, suggesting that filtering out blue light may not have a beneficial effect on sleep as claimed.","In previous studies, it makes no noticeable difference to sleep when the blue light component of display screen devices is filtered out in the evening. However, the results are not well validated because the studies are of low quality and usually only examined a few people."
Can regular intake of vitamin C prevent colds?,"['Although those who swallow vitamin C preventatively are probably a little shorter ill in case of a cold, the effect seems small: With an average duration of seven days of disease, vitamin C would reduce to six to six and a half days of disease.', 'A clear advantage was not shown â€“ the number of participants who had been cold was hardly lower with vitamin C than with placebo.']",2,"The sentences indicate that while vitamin C may slightly reduce the duration of a cold, it does not significantly lower the incidence of colds compared to a placebo, suggesting that regular intake of vitamin C does not effectively prevent colds.","Preventive intake of high-dose vitamin C for a long time does not prevent the occurrence of colds. However, it can reduce the average duration of illness by half a day to a day from a week. Vitamin C is unlikely to improve a cold that has already occurred."
Do saline nasal rinses and nasal sprays or inhaling with steam from saline solution help with colds?,"['It is still unclear whether they have a positive effect on colds.', 'Whether salt water â€“ whether as a rinsing, inhalation or spray â€“ can relieve the discomfort of colds or shorten the disease remains unclear.', ""So whether salt water helps the nose with colds, we can't say.""]",1,"The sentences indicate that the effectiveness of saline nasal rinses, sprays, or steam inhalation for alleviating cold symptoms is still uncertain, as there is no conclusive evidence to support their benefits.",Whether nasal rinses or nasal sprays with salt water help with colds (chills) with a blocked or runny nose cannot be answered by the studies conducted to date. This is because they come to contradictory results and are not very conclusive. Whether inhaling with steam from hot salt water helps with colds has not yet been researched.
Do remedies with ginseng help with erectile dysfunction?,"['No significant effect The current study suggests that no significant improvement can be expected.', 'According to studies, erection ability and satisfaction with sexual intercourse did not increase significantly on average.']",2,"The provided sentences indicate that studies show no significant improvement in erection ability or satisfaction with sexual intercourse when using ginseng, suggesting that it does not effectively help with erectile dysfunction.","Previous studies suggest that dietary supplements with ginseng tend not to bring a significant change. This means that neither erectile function nor sexual satisfaction are likely to improve. At the very least, however, side effects are not likely to occur in large numbers. All assessments are not well substantiated."
Can weighted blankets help with sleep disorders?,"['No evidence of efficacy The result of our research is sobering: We could not find clear indications of a sleep-enhancing effect.', 'Movement measurements of the participants showed that they did not sleep calmer or longer with a weight cover.', 'These results suggest that weight covers do not help with sleep disorders.', 'A positive effect of weight covers on the disturbed sleep is therefore questionable â€“ but we cannot exclude them either.', 'This means: Whether with a heavy or a light blanket â€“ on average there was no difference in total sleep time, time to fall asleep and waking up after the first sleep.']",1,"The research indicates that weighted blankets do not show a clear sleep-enhancing effect, as participants did not experience calmer or longer sleep with them, suggesting they may not help with sleep disorders.","Studies to date find no convincing evidence of effective help for sleep disorders - at least in autistic children and adults with mental illness. However, a benefit cannot be ruled out either. More research is needed."
Does the drug remdesivir prevent COVID-19 deaths?,"['The results are sobering: Remdesivir treatment probably does not prevent deaths from Covid-19 [1,2].', 'However, Remdesivir is unlikely to be a significant aid in the treatment of Covid-19.', 'Not when it comes to the risk of dying: after two to four weeks Remdesivir had died about the same number of people as without Remdesivir.', 'In the studies, an average of 10 to 11 out of 100 patients died within one month, whether they had received Remdesivir, an ineffective dummy medication (placebo) or the usual medical care [1,2].', 'Remdesivir therefore does not seem to prevent deaths.']",2,"The provided sentences indicate that remdesivir treatment does not prevent deaths from COVID-19, as studies show similar mortality rates between patients receiving remdesivir and those receiving placebo or standard care.","For some time, great hope was placed in Remdesivir in the fight against the pandemic. According to the studies conducted so far, however, the drug cannot prevent deaths from Covid-19. It is of little help that the disease seems to worsen somewhat more slowly with Remdesivir."
Does carnosine relieve autism symptoms in children?,"['We have found four studies [1-4] that all come to the same conclusion: They indicate that carnosine is ineffective [5].', 'Summary results with limited expressiveness No improvement (or deterioration) of symptoms was seen in any of the studies â€“ neither in social interaction, communication, nor in rigid, repeated behaviors.', 'A summary analysis of the study results [5] also indicated no improvement.']",2,"The studies reviewed indicate that carnosine does not lead to any improvement in autism symptoms among children, as no positive changes were observed in social interaction, communication, or repetitive behaviors.","Previous studies suggest a lack of efficacy. However, the small number of participants and shortcomings in the study design reduce the significance of the results."
Can ginkgo extract relieve the symptoms of tinnitus?,"['All three studies came to the same conclusion: Ginkgo extract cannot relieve tinnitus better than placebo (a dummy medicine).', ""So Ginkgo doesn't help with tinnitus better than a placebo â€“ but it probably doesn't hurt either.""]",2,"Ginkgo extract has been shown in studies to be no more effective than a placebo in relieving tinnitus symptoms, indicating that it does not provide any significant benefit for this condition.","Preparations with ginkgo extract cannot help with tinnitus. They do not reduce the volume of the ringing in the ears any more than a placebo. This is the result of a summary of the most significant studies, which all came to the same conclusion."
Do remedies with ginkgo help against tinnitus in people with dementia?,"['We can therefore neither affirm nor exclude that drugs containing ginkgo extract have a positive influence on the tinnitus of dementia sufferers.', 'Missing information When reading the individual studies [1-4], it remains unclear how many of the dementia patients studied had tinnitus at all â€“ and how the symptoms of this particular subgroup of subjects have changed in the course of the study.', 'In the individual studies [1-4], there is also a lack of information as to whether the tinnitus patients from the ginkgo and placebo groups were similar enough for a fair comparison.']",1,"The sentences indicate uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of ginkgo remedies for tinnitus in dementia patients, highlighting a lack of clarity about the specific subgroup of patients studied and the comparability of the groups involved.","The efficacy of ginkgo against tinnitus in dementia patients has been co-tested in a few studies. Some of these studies are not well understood. Based on the results published so far, we cannot make a clear assessment of efficacy - i.e. neither confirm nor exclude that ginkgo helps in this case."
Does garlic protect against corona infections?,"['Not studied: Anti-Corona effect We have therefore been looking for meaningful studies.', 'However, we have not found any such study to protect us from Corona.']",1,The sentences indicate that there have been no meaningful studies found to support the claim that garlic protects against corona infections.,"We could not find a single meaningful study on the protective effect of garlic against Corona infections. There is no scientific basis for such claims. On the question of whether garlic protects against colds, we were able to evaluate only one study. However, this is relatively small and has gross weaknesses. The supposedly positive result is therefore not reliable."
Are heavy (ex-)smokers less likely to die of lung cancer if they regularly participate in lung cancer screening by computed tomography (CT)?,"['Probably a little less deaths due to lung cancer The benefits and damage of a systematic screening of lung cancer by computer tomography (short: CT) for current or former strong smokers is documented in two current systematic overviews [1,2].', 'Without screening, 28 out of 1000 participants died of lung cancer With screening, 23 out of 1000 participants died of lung cancer 5 out of 1000 participants were spared a death from lung cancer by screening.', 'This means that we know with quite high certainty that the screenings (some few) of lung cancer deaths in the risk group prevent.', 'In addition, early lung cancer detection sometimes also detects early forms of cancer that would never have caused problems during their lifetime.']",0,"The sentences indicate that lung cancer screening by CT reduces the number of deaths from lung cancer among heavy (ex-)smokers, suggesting a potential benefit in terms of mortality reduction.","Screening in the high-risk group probably prevents deaths from lung cancer. Whether the screened individuals actually live longer and have a higher quality of life is not clear. There are also risks: On the one hand, some screened individuals receive a diagnosis of lung cancer but would not have experienced symptoms during their lifetime. Furthermore, a small proportion of screened individuals must expect a false-positive result (""false alarm""). Until the all-clear is given, interventions are necessary for clarification, during which complications can occur."
Do preparations containing rockrose have a preventive or soothing effect on colds (chills) and other upper respiratory tract infections? Can they protect against infections with the coronavirus?,"['We did not find any studies on the preventive effect of cistrose preparations.', ""This lacks the scientific basis for the manufacturer's claim that cistrose lollipops would protect against colds or even coronas."", 'For this purpose, participants with cold, throat ache or cough sucked several times a day either pastilles with a cistrose extract or pastilles without active substance (placebo).', 'Nor could we find any studies to prevent colds.']",1,"The sentences indicate a lack of scientific studies supporting the claim that rockrose preparations can prevent or soothe colds and upper respiratory infections, including those caused by the coronavirus.","Whether tea, lozenges, or other remedies containing cistus protect against colds has never been studied in humans. There are also no such studies on the preventive effect of cistus against corona.  Whether cistus preparations relieve the symptoms of colds (with colds, sore throats, coughs) or even covid-19 has not been clarified. We did find one study that investigated cistus lozenges for various mild to severe upper respiratory tract infections caused by viruses and bacteria. However, this study has serious flaws and does not provide definite answers about efficacy for colds."
Is plasma therapy for covid-19 effective in preventing deaths?,"['For all individuals combined â€“ from slightly affected to life-threatening â€“ no clear benefit has been seen from plasma therapy.', 'The summary of five studies [2-4,6,7] also makes it impossible to estimate how compatible plasma therapy is for covid-19 patients.', 'But the observed positive effect can be due to chance, and once again no reliable statement can be derived: neither that the plasma therapy at Covid-19 is safe nor that it carries a comparatively high risk.']",1,"The sentences indicate that plasma therapy has not shown a clear benefit in preventing deaths from COVID-19, and the potential positive effects observed may be coincidental, leaving the effectiveness of plasma therapy uncertain.","The summary of studies to date leaves a range of possibilities open. Overall, the data from mildly to fatally ill patients do not demonstrate either a positive effect or negative effects. Serious side effects have not been sufficiently researched and cannot be ruled out."
Can contact with holy water make you sick?,"['It is unclear, however, whether the type and quantity of germs in it is a health risk at all for believers.', 'How the usual contact with holy water can make you ill is virtually unexplored.', 'However, laboratory analyses cannot answer how much contact with the water is necessary to get sick.']",1,"The sentences indicate that the health risks associated with contact with holy water are not well understood, as there is uncertainty about the types and quantities of germs present and how they might affect individuals.","Pathogens often live in holy water basins. However, whether the usual contact with holy water can actually make people ill has not been researched."
Can Echinacea protect against colds?,"['People who swallowed echinacea preparations were slightly less likely to catch a cold in studies.', 'The protective effect of Echinacea is probably rather low and would look like this: If 100 people take an active-free dummy preparation, around 54 get a cold.', 'A little less colds from Echinacea According to the summarized results of all studies, a little less people in the Echinacea group became ill than in the group that received the dummy medication.', 'The regular intake of Echinacea products could thus possibly prevent the occurrence of a cold.', 'According to the study, they were less ill if they also took echinacea.']",0,"The sentences indicate that while there is some evidence suggesting that Echinacea may reduce the likelihood of catching a cold, the overall protective effect is considered to be low and not definitively proven.","Regular intake of echinacea extracts could possibly offer some protection against colds. However, the effect seems to be small. It is unclear whether the plant is also suitable for treatment. Study results on this are contradictory."
Can echinacea relieve the discomfort of colds???,"['No clues to help with colds Unfortunately, the available studies cannot answer whether preparations with Echinacea help if the cold is already there.', 'Effect in case of illness remains unclear Whether Echinacea also helps if the cold is already there, remains unclear despite studies.']",1,"The sentences indicate that despite studies, there is no clear evidence to determine whether echinacea is effective in relieving cold symptoms once a cold has already developed.","Regular intake of echinacea extracts could possibly offer some protection against colds. However, the effect seems to be small. It is unclear whether the plant is also suitable for treatment. Study results on this are contradictory."
Does taking LaVita promote health or physical and mental performance? (Reader inquiry),"['Man is not a test tube The results of unpublished investigations, summarized on the website, do not answer whether LaVita consumption significantly improves health and well-being.', 'Whether the preparation of LaVita also had a direct and noticeable effect on health or mental or physical performance was not investigated in the study.', 'However, the study cannot demonstrate that this is due to the use of LaVita.']",1,The provided sentences indicate that there is no conclusive evidence from the study to determine whether LaVita consumption significantly enhances health or physical and mental performance.,There are no studies that have directly tested this question.
Does taking coenzyme Q10 improve movement disorders in Parkinson's disease?,"['No proven benefit of coenzyme Q10 However, this review results in a rather disappointing result: Movement disorders with coenzyme Q10 are likely to develop similar to those with a sham medication.', ""This means that, according to current knowledge, coenzyme Q10 has no positive effect on Parkinson's typical movement disorders."", 'However, evidence of ineffectiveness of coenzyme Q10 outweighs it.', 'There are no significant differences between coenzyme Q10 and placebo, which would in principle be a good tolerability.']",2,"Coenzyme Q10 has been shown to have no positive effect on movement disorders in Parkinson's disease, as it performs similarly to a placebo with no significant differences in outcomes.","Previous studies suggest that the intake of coenzyme Q10 does not tend to bring about any improvement in movement disorders typical of Parkinson's disease. However, this assessment is not well substantiated."
Does ozonated vegetable oil help against athlete's foot or nail fungus?,"['However, only with little success: For internal use (drips for swallowing) of ozonated vegetable oils we could not find any studies that are at least reasonably meaningful.', 'The question whether ozonated oils help at least as well with various fungal infections as conventional drugs cannot be answered for us.', 'For us, however, this is no evidence that ozonated oil is a good alternative to conventional anti-fungal agents.']",1,"The provided sentences indicate a lack of meaningful studies on the effectiveness of ozonated vegetable oil for treating athlete's foot or nail fungus, suggesting that it may not be a viable alternative to conventional antifungal treatments.",We could not find any studies on these questions that we considered trustworthy.
Are health checks of symptom-free individuals (screening) effective in containing the pandemic?,"['However, questioning and measuring fevers as screening unsuitable people for possible complaints, their itinerary or contacts with patients does not seem to provide reliable results.', 'It is currently uncertain whether rapid tests at the airport, at the border or in health facilities can deliver reliable results and thus slow down the spread of the corona virus.', 'According to these studies, both fever tests and surveys cannot reliably identify infected people as such.', 'The research team cannot answer whether it can inhibit the spread of the Coronavirus to test complaint-free persons for the virus by means of a rapid test.']",1,"The sentences indicate uncertainty and lack of reliable results regarding the effectiveness of screening symptom-free individuals in containing the pandemic, suggesting that such measures may not effectively inhibit the spread of the virus.","Fever measurement at the border, questioning about complaints, or regular corona tests for health care workers: so-called screening involves examining people without complaints for a possible infection. Whether this can slow down the pandemic, however, is not well established. It is also unclear how reliably the series of health checks can distinguish infected from non-infected people. There is currently not enough solid data on this."
Does sunscreen reduce the likelihood of skin cancer?,"['The combined results of previous studies cannot clearly show that sunscreen reduces the risk of skin cancer [3,4].', 'Although studies have been carried out on this issue for 40 years, they are only limited in meaning and come to contradictory results.', 'Both reviews are of high quality, have slightly different strengths and weaknesses, but come to the same conclusion: Due to the very different study results, an influence of sunscreen on the risk of skin cancer cannot be proven.', 'However, we consider the significance of these studies to be very low.']",1,"The sentences indicate that despite extensive research, the evidence regarding sunscreen's effect on reducing skin cancer risk is inconclusive and contradictory, suggesting that a definitive conclusion cannot be drawn.","Although sunscreen protects the skin from sunburn, it has not yet been proven that it can also prevent skin cancer. The existing studies contradict each other. The problem is that the studies often did not take into account whether the participants applied the sunscreen correctly and regularly or whether the sun protection factor was sufficiently high."
Does hypnosis help with smoking cessation?,"['No convincing studies However, whether hypnosis actually helps with smoking cessation is not adequately investigated in studies [1].', 'It is also uncertain whether hypnosis works better than no therapy at all.', 'Therefore, well-made studies are still needed to demonstrate effectiveness.', 'In other studies, hypnosis therapy is hardly better than sham therapy (placebo treatment).', 'Overall, there is no indication of a stronger effect of hypnosis therapy compared to behavioral therapy or other common methods.']",1,"Hypnosis for smoking cessation lacks convincing studies to demonstrate its effectiveness, and existing research indicates it may not be more effective than placebo or other common therapies.","As things stand, the effectiveness of hypnosis for smoking cessation has not been proven. The study results are partly contradictory."
Does taking magnesium improve the symptoms of depression?,"['Apart from the fact that this finding could not always be confirmed [2] : A statistical connection does not automatically mean that a low magnesium level is also the cause of depression â€“ and vice versa, that the depression is improved by magnesium intake.', 'However, it cannot be concluded that magnesium is equivalent to an antidepressant.', 'In the end, all of the depressive symptoms improved, with no difference between magnesium and placebo.', 'Based on these studies, it is not certain whether magnesium actually helps with depression and would be a good alternative to an antidepressant or at least as an additional treatment.']",1,"The sentences indicate that while there is some association between magnesium levels and depression, the evidence does not confirm that magnesium intake effectively improves depressive symptoms or serves as a substitute for antidepressants.",The question has been investigated in only three small studies.

Does closure of the foramen ovale prevent further strokes in people who have had a stroke of unknown cause?,"['If such patients have a PFO, surgical closure can be used to prevent further strokes.', 'Nevertheless, the data speak for the procedure; thus, even if the cause of the stroke is unknown, the risk of a further stroke can be reduced in at least those people who have an open foramen ovale.', 'All three individual studies provide very similar results and indicate that the closure avoids another stroke rather than just anticoagulant therapy with medications.']",0,"Closure of the foramen ovale is indicated to potentially reduce the risk of further strokes in patients with an open foramen ovale, even when the initial stroke cause is unknown, as supported by multiple studies showing better outcomes compared to anticoagulant therapy alone.","According to three large studies, closure of the patent foramen ovale can prevent another stroke better than purely drug treatment can."
Do electric toothbrushes protect oral health better than manual brushes?,"['After a thorough analysis of all the results, they have come to a clear conclusion: Yes, electric toothbrushes are actually better for oral hygiene â€“ but the difference is not large [1].', 'The electric oral cleaning thus removes a trace better than hand toothbrushes.', 'If you brush your teeth electrically, you will also get a little less gingival inflammation than people who brush manually, according to the results of the analyzed studies.', 'The advantage of electric toothbrushes compared to conventional toothbrushes is small.']",0,"The analysis indicates that while electric toothbrushes provide some benefits for oral hygiene, such as slightly better plaque removal and reduced gingival inflammation, the overall advantage over manual brushes is minimal.",Electric toothbrushes probably combat plaque and bleeding gums slightly better than conventional manual toothbrushes. The type of electric brush does not seem to play a major role.
Can topiramate reduce the frequency of migraine attacks?,"['The authors summarized the results of 17 studies and found that the number of headaches actually decreases â€“ but only by one in 28 days.', '[1] The overview also shows positive effects on the overall quality of life, but only to a small extent and not quite without contradiction.', 'Although all studies go in the same direction and indicate the effectiveness of topiramate, despite the review work of Cochrane Collaboration, the evidence is low, also because there are other criticisms: The authors have several conflicts of interest and it is possible that studies with poor results have not been published (publication bias).', 'Little knowledge about chronic migraine In the expert recommendation on therapy and care for chronic migraine, two small studies are mentioned, according to which topiramate can also prevent in chronic migraine attacks [2].']",0,"The evidence regarding topiramate's effectiveness in reducing migraine frequency is inconclusive, as studies indicate a slight decrease in headache frequency but highlight low overall evidence quality and potential biases.","Possibly yes. A review by the Cochrane Collaboration attests that topiramate slightly reduces the frequency of migraine attacks in adults, and in some patients the attacks even decrease significantly. Still, there are unanswered questions and the side effects should not be underestimated."
Are there methods that effectively help against hormonal hair loss?,"['The efficacy of the active substance minoxidil is very well secured.', 'Regular use of a 2 or 3% minoxidil solution on the scalp may lead to cosmetically significant improvements in approximately three out of ten men affected [6].', 'Also in women with hormonal hair loss shows the treatment with Minoxidil effect.', 'Also scientifically well documented is the effect of finasteride [1] [2] [4] [5] [6].', 'There is evidence that the active substance can improve hormonal hair loss, as it intervenes in the hormone balance similar to finasteride.']",0,"The provided sentences indicate that both minoxidil and finasteride have documented efficacy in treating hormonal hair loss, suggesting that there are effective methods available for this condition.","Besides own hair transplantation, the active substances finasteride or minoxidil (as a solution) can help, but both agents have side effects. The effectiveness of other means is hardly or not secured."
Can Internet-based self-help training based on cognitive behavioral therapy reduce the burden of tinnitus?,"['Accordingly, the authors of a systematic review of Cochrane Collaboration [ 1 ] found strong evidence that cognitive behavioral therapy can lead to a noticeable improvement in the quality of life despite persistent tinnitus.', 'In addition, the therapy can lead to a low relief of depressive moods, which suffer from numerous tinnitus patients.', 'The self-help training developed at LinkÃ¶ping University in Sweden is a version of an already proven cognitive behavioral therapy program for tinnitus patients adapted to the Internet.', 'But also a newly developed Internet program to increase tinnitus acceptance with the help of mindfulness-based strategies proved equally effective.', 'Summary It seems likely that cognitive therapies for tinnitus management not only bring improvement in traditional group sessions, but also in the form of Internet-based self-help training programs.']",0,"The evidence indicates that cognitive behavioral therapy, including Internet-based self-help training, can improve the quality of life for tinnitus patients and may also alleviate depressive symptoms associated with tinnitus.","Cognitive behavioral therapy can noticeably improve the quality of life and depressiveness of tinnitus sufferers. Internet-based self-help training based on cognitive behavioral therapy could be similarly helpful, but is often discontinued by sufferers."
Do probiotic foods have an antidepressant effect or a positive effect on the mind?,"['The study referred to in oe24.at [1] cannot answer the question whether probiotic foods improve the mood.', 'The scientists do not indicate whether the probiotically treated subjects were already less depressed and anxious before the start of the experiment than those who did not receive a probiotic product.']",1,"The sentences indicate that the study cannot determine whether probiotic foods have a positive effect on mood, as it does not clarify the initial mental state of the subjects involved.","Whether probiotics can help with depression or have a positive effect on the mood has never been investigated in clinical trials. In people with constipation, they could possibly improve mood."
Does frequent porn use reduce gray matter volume in the brain?,"['[1] Cause and effect The study shows a correlation between frequent consumption of porn and the size of a brain region, but cannot provide any information as to whether the size of the gray brain mass changes due to consumption of porn.', 'No damage detectable In 2011, three Californian researchers pointed out that there was no evidence of brain damage due to porn consumption.', 'All studies that went in this direction have the same problem as the current study: It is not clear what is the cause and what is the effect â€“ there is no study that actually investigates the long-term effects of porn consumption on the brain.']",1,"The sentences indicate that while there is a correlation between frequent porn consumption and brain structure, there is no definitive evidence to establish a causal relationship or to confirm any changes in gray matter volume due to porn use.",The study is not powered to examine the long-term effects of pornography on the brain and other studies on this were not found.
Is breaking an energy-saving lamp harmful to health?,"['[3] If an energy-saving lamp breaks, the mercury contained therein escapes, among other things, in the form of mercury vapour.', 'However, these experiments did not directly investigate whether this could lead to signs of poisoning in humans.', 'Even if the safety limit has been exceeded in some cases, mercury vapour concentrations in the ambient air did not reach levels for which a health hazard is considered probable in any study.']",1,"The sentences indicate that while breaking an energy-saving lamp releases mercury vapour, studies have not conclusively shown that this exposure leads to health hazards in humans, suggesting insufficient information to determine the health risks associated with such incidents.","If an energy-saving lamp breaks, mercury vapor is released in quantities that can exceed the limits considered safe. Whether this can cause damage to health has not been directly investigated. However, after removal of the broken glass and good ventilation of the room, the value quickly falls back below the limit value."
Do air ions cause an improvement of allergies?,['Hardly any studies on anti-allergic effects No clinical studies have been performed to date on the alleged anti-allergic effects of air ions.'],1,"The sentences indicate that there is a lack of clinical studies on the anti-allergic effects of air ions, suggesting insufficient evidence to support the claim that air ions improve allergies.","Whether ionized air can reduce allergic symptoms is unclear, as no studies exist on this question. Air ionization devices do not appear to be effective against asthma in general."
Does caffeine make us die sooner???,"['However, this does not yet clarify whether caffeine shortens or prolongs life.', 'This does not mean that it is caffeine that reduces the risk of mortality; it only shows that people who drink a lot of coffee differ in their risk from people who drink little coffee.', 'Why this is so and what role caffeine itself plays is not clarified â€“ even if it could be shown by which mechanisms caffeine may have its positive effect [c].']",1,"The sentences indicate that while there may be a correlation between caffeine consumption and mortality risk, the exact relationship and whether caffeine itself influences lifespan remain unclear.","In moderate amounts, alcohol could reduce the likelihood of dying prematurely. In higher doses, however, it clearly increases this risk. This is unclear for caffeine."
Do earrings cause discomfort by destroying acupuncture points or meridians?,"['However, we could not find any studies that would have investigated earrings and their effects on meridians or acupuncture points.']",1,The absence of studies investigating the effects of earrings on meridians or acupuncture points indicates that there is insufficient information to determine whether earrings cause discomfort by affecting these points.,"Earrings very often lead to complications, fortunately most of them are harmless. However, whether earrings can also destroy meridians or similar representation points of body regions in the auricle and thus lead to health complaints has not been investigated in studies."
Do fish oil capsules promote prostate cancer?,"['[4] [5] High dose of fish oil could increase prostate cancer risk The article in the courier is based on a recently published case-control study [1].', 'The US study authors concluded that high blood levels of omega-3 fatty acids DHA, EPA and DPA are associated with a higher probability of prostate cancer.', 'Study participants with particularly large amounts of this omega-3 fat in the blood had an increased risk of prostate cancer by 43 percent compared to men with low intake of fish oil.', 'A systematic review [2] of previous studies seems to support these findings: As a result, high concentrations of the two omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA in the blood could increase the risk of high-grade prostate cancer by 39 percent (i.e.', 'The researchers can show a connection between the consumption of high doses of fish oils and the occurrence of prostate cancer.']",0,"The sentences indicate a correlation between high doses of fish oil and an increased risk of prostate cancer, suggesting that fish oil capsules may promote prostate cancer.","In general, there seems to be a negative effect of omega-3 fatty acids in fish oil capsules: DHA and EPA in high doses could increase the risk of prostate cancer. However, the results should be viewed with caution. Other, still unknown factors could also play an important role."
Does taking the birth control pill adversely affect mate choice? (Reader inquiry),"['Since ovulation does not occur by taking the pill and there are hormonal fluctuations with it, some researchers suspect that this also has an effect on the attractiveness of women taking the pill.', 'Claims that taking the pill leads to the wrong choice of partner or the withdrawal of the pill leads to the breakup of a relationship are exaggerated speculation and scientifically unproven.']",1,"The sentences indicate that while there are some hypotheses about the impact of the birth control pill on mate choice, claims regarding its adverse effects on partner selection remain speculative and lack scientific validation.","Even though individual studies find a slight correlation between taking the pill and choosing a partner, there is no evidence that it negatively affects partner choice."
Can regular screening significantly reduce the risk of dying from prostate cancer?,"['Regular PSA tests can hardly reduce the likelihood of dying early, but have a high risk of severe side effect.', ""In the Swedish arm of a randomized-controlled study from 2011 [3], the damage caused by the overtherapy is clearly shown in figures: 37 men whose tumor was discovered by PSA screening must on average be removed from the prostate to save one's life.""]",2,"The sentences indicate that regular PSA tests do not significantly reduce the likelihood of dying from prostate cancer and highlight the negative consequences of overtherapy, suggesting that screening may not effectively lower mortality risk.","The regular PSA screening test can hardly reduce the risk of death from prostate cancer.

"Is the HIV saliva self-test, which is about to be approved in the U.S., as reliable as a laboratory test or a rapid test at the doctor's office?","['More inaccurate than the doctor The saliva test is relatively reliable, but is less accurate than a rapid test performed with blood.', 'In any case, manufacturers of HIV rapid tests recommend a test result evaluation by laboratory tests.']",0,"The saliva HIV self-test is noted to be less accurate than a rapid blood test, and manufacturers recommend confirming results with laboratory tests, indicating it may not be as reliable as the tests mentioned in the claim.","The aforementioned HIV self-test of saliva samples is significantly less accurate than a standard laboratory blood test. Relatively likely, it is also more inaccurate when self-performed than a rapid saliva or blood test performed by a physician."
Can taking the enzyme diamino oxidase prevent alcohol-related hangover symptoms?,"['Two of the capsules containing the active substance diamino-oxidase (DAO) â€“ taken before drinking alcohol â€“ should not even cause or at least partially prevent hangover symptoms the next morning â€“ one learns something disillusioned at the end of the courier article by a university professor.', ""Therefore, the manufacturer's claim that its DAO-contained product can reduce or even prevent the unpleasant consequences of excessive consumption of alcohol is not scientifically substantiated.""]",1,"The sentences indicate that while there is a suggestion that diamino oxidase may prevent hangover symptoms, the manufacturer's claims lack scientific substantiation, leaving the effectiveness of the enzyme in preventing alcohol-related hangover symptoms unproven.","Such an effect is not likely, nor do clinical studies exist on this issue."
Can sexual activity relieve headaches?,"['Instead of the 60 colported, only 44 out of 100 migraine patients â€“ less than half â€“ actually noticed at least sometimes a relief of their pain.', 'In some one third of respondents, sexual activities occasionally resulted in improvement, but in half of them a worsening of the symptoms.']",1,"The sentences indicate that while some migraine patients may experience relief from sexual activity, a significant portion report either no relief or worsening symptoms, suggesting that the relationship between sexual activity and headache relief is not clearly established.","Individuals report subjective improvement.
