Is the homeopathic remedy Neradin effective for erectile dysfunction?,"['No studies on Neradin Also our search for studies on the product Neradin remained resultless.', 'Studies on the product Neradin also appear to be missing.']",1,"The claim cannot be supported because no studies on the effectiveness of Neradin for erectile dysfunction were found, and its impact remains unproven by available research.","The extract from the Damiana plant (Turnera diffusa) is advertised as a remedy for erectile dysfunction for men. However, this claimed effect on potency is by no means proven. It has apparently never been tested on humans. This also applies to homeopathic remedies such as the product Neradin."
Can the so-called Tupler technique help against rectus diastasis?,"['No studies on the Tupler technique As intense as we were looking for, we could not find the promised studies on the Tupler technique.', 'The claim that this is a scientifically proven therapy for rectus diastase is therefore simply wrong.', 'The studies in detail We did not find any studies that investigated the effectiveness of the Tupler technique for the treatment of rectus diastase.']",1,"The claim that the Tupler technique is a scientifically proven therapy for rectus diastasis is incorrect, as no studies investigating its effectiveness for this condition were found.",We could not find a single study that examined whether the Tupler technique actually works. And this despite the fact that providers of the method advertise that its effectiveness is scientifically proven.
Does arthroscopy (joint endoscopy) help with osteoarthritis of the knee joint?,"['What might sound logical, however, has a catch: the arthroscopy of osteoarthritis does nothing to the treated person.', 'Studies clearly speak against a benefit A research team summarized the most meaningful of all previously published studies on arthroscopy in knee arthritis.', 'In these studies, patients treated after arthroscopy had no noticeably less pain or movement restrictions than those treated only for appearance or not at all.', 'Arthroscopy against osteoarthritis: not effective, but also not very risky After all: Undesirable events were not conspicuously common in the arthroscopy groups either.']",2,"The claim that arthroscopy helps with osteoarthritis of the knee joint is refuted by several studies indicating no significant reduction in pain or movement restrictions for patients who undergo the procedure, compared to those who receive no treatment or placebo treatment.",The data are clear: Arthroscopy is useless as a treatment for knee osteoarthritis. It can neither relieve pain nor improve the function of the knee joint in the long term.
"Do dietary supplements containing silicon (e.g. as ""organic silicon"" or silica) have health benefits?","['So far it is also completely unclear what role the element silicon plays in the human body at all [8].', 'We have researched: Previous studies do not provide any evidence that dietary supplements with silicon support bone build-up and thus protect older women from osteoporosis and bone fractures in old age [1,2].', 'There is no evidence that silicon improves the hair structure [3,4], strengthens the fingernails [4] or makes the skin more beautiful and elastic [4,6,7].', 'Also that silicon supports the formation of collagen and connective tissue is only a conjecture [8].', 'Conjectures without studies Neither we nor the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) [8] were able to find clinical studies on any other alleged health benefits of silicon.']",1,"The role of silicon in the human body is unclear, and no studies provide evidence that dietary supplements with silicon support bone build-up, improve hair structure, strengthen fingernails, make the skin more beautiful, or support collagen and connective tissue formation.","There is no evidence so far that the additional intake of silicon can promote health. Also that it strengthens nails, skin and hair is an unsubstantiated claim. Moreover, it is unclear whether silicon plays any role at all in the body."
Can regular intake of cranberry juice or cranberry extract prevent recurrent cystitis in women?,"['The summarized results show that the regular intake of cranberry products could have a preventive effect.', 'There is also only evidence that cranberry products can prevent bladder inflammation for otherwise healthy women.', 'Overall, there is evidence of a possible preventive effect of cranberry.']",0,"The summarized results indicate that cranberry products may prevent bladder inflammation for generally healthy women, but the evidence does not clearly support a preventive effect against recurrent cystitis in all women.","Women who repeatedly have to deal with bladder infections might become ill somewhat less frequently if they regularly take cranberry juice or extract. However, this is not well established. And it only applies to uncomplicated bladder infections in otherwise healthy women. Whether cranberry products help when cystitis is already present remains unclear. This has not yet been investigated in meaningful studies."
Does covid vaccination reduce the likelihood of getting long-lasting symptoms (long covid) in case of corona infection?,"['Long-Covid risk with low vaccination Two studies [1,2] suggest that the long-covid risk is likely to be lower if vaccinated twice: In one of these studies with Corona infected [1], twice vaccinated patients reported 40 to 50 percent less likely to be affected by Long Covid compared to non-vaccinated patients.', 'Results Two-fold Vaccinated people reported to be affected by long-covid symptoms only about half as often as non-vaccinated people.']",0,"Twice vaccinated individuals report being affected by long-covid symptoms roughly half as often as non-vaccinated individuals, suggesting a lower risk of long-lasting symptoms with vaccination.","If twice-vaccinated people are infected, their risk of later being affected by Long Covid may be only half that of non-vaccinated people. Since there is no clear definition of long covid, the protective effect cannot be precisely quantified."
Can the preventive intake of lysine prevent cold sores (lip herpes) and genital herpes? Can lysine help when the blisters are already there?,"['You cannot answer whether preventively taken lysine can prevent herpes, or whether it helps if the blisters are already there.', ""So the lysine didn't seem to have any effect."", 'Does a higher dose of lysine work better than a lower dose?', 'Results Overall, the participants had no less frequent herpes, whether they were taking high-dose lysine, low-dose lysine or placebo.', 'Results The results are ambiguous and do not allow for certain conclusions: both the Lysin group and the placebo group were less likely to have lip herpes after 6 months.']",1,"The sentences provided offer no definitive evidence that preventively taken lysine can prevent herpes or help when blisters are already present, as some results are ambiguous and no significant difference was found between lysine doses or placebo.",Research is coming up with inconclusive and contradictory results. All available studies are small and of unclear quality. We could not say whether lysine protects against herpes or can alleviate it.
"Do hormonal contraceptives to swallow (the ""pill"") affect endurance performance in women?","['The conclusion of the work: Women taking the pill could actually have a minor disadvantage in sports.', 'Specifically, women with a pill may absorb less oxygen during training and are out of breath faster.', 'Possibly a slightly lower performance through the pill – to this conclusion also came another current overview work [2].']",0,Women taking hormonal contraceptives may experience a minor decrease in endurance performance due to reduced oxygen absorption during training and increased breathlessness.,"Taking the pill could possibly impair endurance performance in sports somewhat. However, there are no indications of less muscle strength due to the pill. However, these - somewhat contradictory - findings are anything but certain. Whether the somewhat reduced endurance performance speaks against contraception with the pill, each athlete must decide for herself - depending on how important top athletic performance is for her."
Does whole-body cryotherapy in the cold chamber improve health?,"['Moreover, they cannot ensure that alleged improvements are really due to the cold chamber.', 'Based on these data, it is impossible to assess whether whole-body cooling therapy is effective and useful in different health problems.', 'However, none of the studies can prove the effectiveness of the cold chamber treatment, because everyone lacks meaningfulness.']",1,"The studies on whole-body cryotherapy do not provide sufficient evidence to determine its effectiveness in improving health, as they cannot ensure improvements are due to the cold chamber and lack meaningfulness.","Studies published so far are of low quality and therefore not conclusive. The effectiveness of the cold chamber has not been proven for either physical or psychological complaints. There is also no evidence of effectiveness in sports, for example for sore muscles or for a hoped-for increase in athletic performance."
Can low-level laser therapy reduce pain from knee or hip osteoarthritis?,"['According to the research team behind the review, the study situation for low-level laser therapy in knee arthrosis is not sufficient to confirm or exclude efficacy.', 'This was not the case, the laser treatment could not relieve the pain better than placebo treatment.']",1,"The research team's review of low-level laser therapy for knee osteoarthritis does not provide sufficient evidence to confirm or exclude its efficacy in pain relief, and a study found that it was no more effective than a placebo treatment.","In the pain treatment of wrist osteoarthritis, no efficacy can be assumed - this is indicated by the results of a small but well-done study. Research results on knee osteoarthritis are contradictory and therefore of little significance. We did not find any reliable studies on hip osteoarthritis."
"Do mouth rinses with hydroxyapatite, for example the products ""Linola sept mouth rinse"" and ""Karex Abwehr"", protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection?","['In our search in three different scientific databases, we did not find any studies that investigated the supposed anti-coronavirus effect of the mouthwashes ""Linola sept"" and ""Karex Defense"".', 'However, it is questionable whether patients have become healthy faster and this has not been studied.', 'For the claim that mouthwashes with hydroxyapatite could avoid corona infections, there is no scientific evidence.', 'Our conclusion: Scientific evidence of an effect of mouthwashes against Corona infections is missing.', 'We could not find any studies that investigated whether Covid-19 patients would recover faster if they gurgled with hydroxyapatite solutions.']",1,"The claim that mouth rinses with hydroxyapatite, such as ""Linola sept mouth rinse"" and ""Karex Abwehr,"" protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection is not supported by scientific evidence, as no studies investigating this specific anti-coronavirus effect were found in the search of three scientific databases.","There are no studies on the anti-corona effect of hydroxyapatite-containing mouth rinses such as ""Linola sept"" or ""Karex Abwehr"". We found no studies on the products themselves or on the alleged active ingredient hydroxyapatite. The claimed mechanism of action is not plausible."
Does CBD or cannabis use protect against covid-19 disease???,"['No studies on CBD as covid protection We cannot answer whether the regular intake of CBD can prevent a Covid-19 disease, which has not yet been investigated.', 'Although she appears in some media reports, the report is simply wrong that the researchers had demonstrated an anti-corona effect of CBD in their study: According to the research team, CBD had no effect on the corona virus in the experiments.', 'Also, it appears that the regular intake of cannabinoids such as CBD can prevent covid-19 disease has not been studied.']",1,"The claim that CBD or cannabis use protects against COVID-19 disease is not supported by the provided sentences, as there are no studies demonstrating an anti-corona effect of CBD or the preventative properties of regular cannabinoid intake against the virus.","CBD is unlikely to have any effect on the symptoms of covid-19 disease. This is the conclusion of the only study that has investigated this. However, its validity is somewhat limited due to the small number of participants. Not explored is a possible preventive effect. It is unclear whether CBD or other cannabis constituents - ingested or smoked - protect against corona infection or covid-19 disease."
Does taking taiga root extract strengthen the immune system? Can it make vaccinations more effective or tolerable?,"['Taiga Root and Immune Defense: Extensive Studies Missing In our extensive research, we have not found any studies that can demonstrate an immune-strengthening effect of the Taiga Root.', 'However, the studies were too small and inadequate for reliable results.', 'Whether the taiga root is beneficial to the immune defense can not be proven at the present time – but also cannot be ruled out.', 'The two available studies also do not provide any information on whether taiga root extract could even make vaccinations more effective.']",1,"The claim that taiga root extract strengthens the immune system and makes vaccinations more effective or tolerable cannot be supported or refuted due to insufficient and inconclusive studies, as stated in the sentences.",The alleged immune-strengthening effect of taiga root (also called Siberian ginseng) has apparently never been investigated in appropriate studies. The positive effect claimed by dietary supplement manufacturers after vaccinations is also not proven.
Does short-term fasting improve quality of life in cancer?,"['On this basis, we cannot reliably say whether fasting during chemotherapy is actually useful or not, thus reducing side effects and improving the quality of life.', 'In terms of quality of life, there are already contradictions within the individual studies: in the study [1b], in which the participants switched between fasting and non-fasting after half of the chemotherapy, only in one group did the quality of life improve during fasting, in the other the quality of life did not improve.', 'Whether this is actually noticeable for cancer patients remains questionable.']",1,"While some studies suggest that fasting during chemotherapy may improve quality of life in certain cases, other studies show contradictory results, making it questionable whether this effect is noticeable for cancer patients.",We found only three very small studies on both questions. Their results are so unreliable that we cannot make any assessment. So we cannot say whether the quality of life of those affected is improved and whether fasting during chemotherapy reduces side effects.
Does zinc preventively protect against covid-19 disease???,"['A preventive effect has not yet been researched in a single study.', 'It is therefore unclear whether the preventive use of zinc preparations protects against an infection with SARS-CoV-2 or a Covid-19 disease.']",1,"The claim that zinc prevents COVID-19 has not been researched in any study yet, leaving it unclear whether zinc preparations offer protective benefits against SARS-CoV-2 infection or Covid-19 disease.",The results of two studies on this suggest that sufferers with Covid-19 do not recover more quickly with zinc than without. A preventive effect has not yet been investigated in studies.
Do agents containing uridine and/or cytidine improve the symptoms of polyneuropathy?,"['Despite searching in three large databases, we have not been able to find any studies that met these criteria.', 'Whether drugs with uridine and/or cytidine actually help with polyneuropathia, we cannot estimate on this basis.']",1,The claim cannot be supported or refuted since there is no available evidence or studies found that investigate the effect of agents containing uridine and/or cytidine on polyneuropathy symptoms.,We have not been able to find any meaningful studies on this question.
Do saw palmetto preparations improve the symptoms of benign enlarged prostate (benign prostatic hyperplasia) in the longer term compared to placebo?,"['No better than placebo The two systematic overviews [1,2] come to the conclusion in the summary in agreement: The saw palm preparations do not relieve prostate problems better than a sham medication.', 'In other studies that tested saw palm as an addition to tamsulosin, the addition of saw palm did not bring any extra benefit.']",2,"The two systematic overviews and other studies consistently show that saw palmetto preparations do not alleviate prostate problems more effectively than a placebo, even when used in combination with tamsulosin.","According to current studies, remedies with saw palmetto do not improve the symptoms of a benign enlarged prostate in the longer term more than a placebo. This assessment is well supported."
Can capsules or tablets with lactase improve the symptoms of lactose intolerance and make dairy products more tolerable?,"['The magnitude of the effect of lactase and the noticeable improvement of symptoms cannot be derived from all studies.', 'Fewer symptoms with lactase In five studies, the participants from the lactase group reported a total of fewer complaints [2-4.6.7].', 'In only one study [4], the participants reported a marked improvement after taking lactase – their symptoms were only half as severe.', 'Lactase tablets and capsules may make dairy products at least slightly more compatible with lactose intolerance.']",0,"While some studies suggest a slight improvement in lactose intolerance symptoms with lactase tablets or capsules, the magnitude of this effect cannot be determined from all studies, and only one study reported a marked improvement.","Tablets and capsules containing the enzyme lactase may alleviate the symptoms of lactose intolerance. It is unclear whether those affected feel the effect clearly. Our assessment is not well substantiated. The studies published to date are very small and, for the most part, poorly conducted."
Do oral zinc supplements prevent a cold???,['We have found that preparations with zinc for oral use – such as lozenges – do not cast away the annoying colds.'],1,"The claim that oral zinc supplements prevent a cold is not supported by the statement indicating that zinc preparations, such as lozenges, do not eliminate colds.","It is possible that oral zinc supplements may slightly shorten the duration of a cold in adults. However, many details concerning efficacy and safety are still unclear. Studies to date cannot answer the question of whether zinc also has a preventive effect - they are not conclusive enough."
Do you get a stomach ache if you eat cherries or other stone fruit and then drink water?,"['Research does not seem to be particularly concerned about the potential risk of this food combination.', 'In any case, we could not find a single study on the subject in our elaborate research.', 'In short, there are no scientific studies that show that drinking water after eating cherries causes discomfort.', 'But this explanation does not seem particularly plausible for the cherries-water myth: On the one hand, the ""problem of short-term gastric acid dilution not only arises with water [6].']",1,"The claim that drinking water after eating cherries causes a stomach ache is not supported by any scientific studies, and alternative explanations for this myth lack plausibility.",We found no scientific studies or documented case reports showing that drinking water after eating cherries causes discomfort.
Is ivermectin an effective drug for treating covid 19 disease?,"[""According to previous studies, probably wrong: Ivermectin may not have a noticeable effect on a Covid-19 disease: it does not seem to alleviate the disease's symptoms."", 'Both the European Supervisory Authority EMA (European Medical Agency) and the World Health Organization WHO currently advise against the use of ivermectin for the treatment of Covid-19 (as of July 2021) [6,7].', 'There was no difference between the ivermectin and placebo groups – therefore, ivermectin does not seem to help to mitigate the symptoms typical of Covid-19.']",2,"The claim is refuted by previous studies, the European Medical Agency, and the World Health Organization, as well as a specific study showing no difference between ivermectin and placebo groups in alleviating Covid-19 symptoms.","Studies to date suggest that ivermectin does not mitigate covid-19. There is also no evidence that the drug can prevent deaths from covid-19. However, a possible beneficial effect cannot be ruled out with certainty either. Larger studies would be needed for this."
"Does a nasal spray with carrageenan from red algae relieve discomfort from a cold (""chill"")?","['Relieving little likely And what if you are already ill and the cooling is full of ""blooming up""?', 'However, it is doubtful that this effect is so great that it makes a noticeable difference for people with a cold.', 'That cold sprays with red algae carragees actually have a great benefit in colds is therefore not likely.']",2,"The sentences express uncertainty and skepticism about the significant relief that nasal sprays with carrageenan from red algae can provide for cold discomfort, suggesting they may not be highly beneficial.",Such a nasal spray is unlikely to significantly alleviate cold symptoms or shorten the duration of the cold. Whether the spray can in principle protect against a cold has not yet been researched.
Does a nasal spray with carrageenan from red algae prevent colds?,"['Preventive effect unclear As far as the theory is concerned.', 'Avoiding contagion Overall, the possibilities for preventing a cold are limited.', 'Because in most cases, the worst is over after a week.The studies in detail To prevent colds, we could not find any studies in our research.']",1,"The claim about a nasal spray with carrageenan from red algae preventing colds is not supported by the provided sentences, as there are no studies indicating its effectiveness in preventing colds.",Such a nasal spray is unlikely to significantly alleviate cold symptoms or shorten the duration of the cold.

However, these results are not well established. The study results available to date cannot reliably answer the question of whether patients with budesonide also need to be hospitalized less often. It is also unclear whether budesonide can also help severely ill patients or prevent deaths caused by Covid-19."
Does hydroxychloroquine prevent covid-19 infection???,"['And they are as clear as disappointing: therefore hydroxychloroquine can do nothing against the corona virus.', 'Not suitable for prevention Even a preventive effect does not indicate anything: In studies with healthy individuals, the number of participants who regularly take hydroxychloroquine as well as those without medication [2] was similar.', 'The preventive use of hydroxychloroquine could not protect the subjects from a Covid-19 disease.']",2,"The sentences provide evidence that hydroxychloroquine does not have a preventive effect against Covid-19, as studies show no difference in infection rates between those who regularly take the medication and those who do not.","The results of all studies to date preclude hydroxychloroquine from preventing deaths in covid-19 patients. The drug also does not appear to attenuate the disease. A preventive effect is also unlikely, according to the study results. It is well documented that hydroxychloroquine has side effects.

Can vitamin C prevent infection with coronavirus or prevent deaths from covid-19?,"['The comparison of the two groups does not indicate that vitamin C can prevent deaths from Covid-19.', 'It is therefore unexplored whether vitamin C can reduce the risk of coronavirus infection.']",1,"The first sentence refutes the claim that vitamin C can prevent deaths from Covid-19, while the second sentence indicates that it is still unexplored whether vitamin C can reduce the risk of coronavirus infection.",Studies to date are inconclusive. There is no evidence that high-dose vitamin C infusions reduce the risk of dying from covid-19. A preventive effect has not been researched at all.
Does treatment with cortisone-like drugs such as dexamethasone ensure that more critically ill patients survive Covid 19 disease?,"['They have found out that the remedies actually have a benefit – even if not for all patients.', 'Only in case of severe progression In case of a serious or even life-threatening course of disease, treatment with cortisone-like medications can reduce mortality in addition to the usual (intensive) measures.', 'With additional cortisone treatment 328 out of 1000 people die with the usual treatment 415 out of 1000 people Cortisone treatment thus saves about 87 out of 1000 people with critical Covid19 disease.', 'In case of severe covid-19 disease, 267 out of 1000 people die with additional cortisone treatment with the usual treatment 334 out of 1000 people Cortisone treatment thus saves about 67 out of 1000 people with severe covid-19 disease.']",0,"The sentences suggest that cortisone-like drugs can reduce mortality in critically or severely ill COVID-19 patients, but they do not confirm that such treatment ensures more critically ill patients will survive the disease.","In severe or even life-threatening covid-19 disease, cortisone-like medications can save lives.

Are international travel restrictions and border health checks effective in curbing the spread of covid-19?,"['Some studies conclude that screenings at the border may be helpful to slow down the impact of the outbreak and reduce deaths a little.', 'Rather, their evaluations would suggest that some travel-related control measures in the event of outbreaks of COVID-19, but also SARS and MERS, could have a positive impact on the outcome of the infection.']",0,"The sentences suggest that some travel-related control measures, including during COVID-19, SARS, and MERS outbreaks, could have a positive impact on infection outcomes, supporting the claim that border health checks and travel restrictions might be helpful in curbing the spread of COVID-19.","It may be that travel-related control measures lead to a reduction in the ""import"" and ""export"" of infections across borders. It could also be that the number of infected people increases more slowly. Health checks at the border could also identify previously undetected infections - but whether this will put a real damper on the pandemic is certainly questionable."
Does denosumab (Prolia) reduce the risk of vertebral fractures in osteoporosis?,"['Denosumab was able to prevent such vertebral fractures in about 1 out of 100 female participants.', 'Compared to some other osteoporosis agents, denosumab seems to be able to prevent vertebral fractures in some cases.']",0,"Denosumab has shown promising results in preventing vertebral fractures in some osteoporosis patients, as seen in a study where it prevented such fractures in approximately 1% of female participants, and it appears to outperform certain other osteoporosis agents in some cases.",The pooled results of studies to date show that denosumab reduces the risk of vertebral fractures more than a placebo. It may even be slightly more protective than single other osteoporosis drugs.  It cannot be ruled out that discontinuing denosumab increases the likelihood of vertebral fractures again. The studies on this are contradictory.
Does a ketogenic diet help against cancer?,"['So far, there is no evidence of the efficacy of the ketogenic diet in cancer.', 'Effect on tumors so far unexplored This means that until today, the question that is actually relevant to cancer patients – whether low-carbohydrate or non-carbohydrate diets can do something about cancer cells – has hardly been investigated in humans.', 'The few studies available so far do not report any or at most an unsafe anti-cancer effect of the ketogenic diet.']",1,"The few studies available do not report any or at most an unsafe anti-cancer effect of the ketogenic diet, and the question of its impact on cancer cells has been minimally explored in humans, providing no substantial evidence for the claim of its efficacy against cancer.","To date, there are no well-done studies that have examined the effect of a ketogenic diet on cancer in humans. This involves eating little or no carbohydrates and sugar, but plenty of protein and fat. Experts take a critical view of ""cancer diets"" such as the ketogenic diet - they can also be dangerous."
Can a special mattress relieve nighttime rheumatism symptoms and thus improve sleep?,"['Many mattresses, no studies To this end, we have searched in several scientific databases for studies on rheumatism and mattresses – but without success.', 'It is currently impossible to answer whether a specific mattress can help those affected.', 'The studies in detail We could not find any studies that investigated the effect of mattresses on rheumatism pain.']",1,"The search of scientific databases revealed no studies investigating the effect of mattresses on rheumatism pain, making it impossible to determine if a specific mattress can help alleviate symptoms.","During our research, we did not find any scientific studies on this.

Cesarean sections are likely to be needed less often with inductions than with waiting. The use of a suction cup and forceps is unlikely to change much, if at all. The results apply to women with no special risks and in the case that the pregnancy continues beyond the expected delivery date."
Is it safe to take preparations containing unsaponifiable components of avocado and soybean oils (ASU)?,"['Participants taking an ASU preparation reported adverse reactions as frequently (or rarely) as participants in the placebo groups.', 'We consider the result to be trustworthy: Therefore, preparations with ASU are safe.']",0,"The trustworthy result indicates that participants taking ASU preparations reported adverse reactions at a similar frequency as those in the placebo groups, providing no evidence to refute the claim that ASU preparations are safe.",There is evidence of minor efficacy of preparations containing avocado and soybean oil (ASU). They can probably somewhat alleviate movement restrictions and pain in osteoarthritis of the knee joint - at least in the short term. An effect in osteoarthritis of the hip joint has not yet been shown. Side effects are not to be expected.
Does taking arginine benefit existing cardiovascular disease or does arginine prevent it from developing?,"['After three months, the results of the two groups were compared and the study authors came to a rather sobering result: In the Arginin group, neither quality of life nor physical resilience of the participants had improved compared to the placebo group.', 'Due to the small number of participants and the short duration of the study, the compatibility of arginine with these data cannot be assessed.', 'From our point of view, it is also questionable how well the results of this study with heart failure sufferers are transferable to people with other types of cardiovascular disease.']",1,"The study's findings do not support the claim that arginine improves quality of life or physical resilience in heart failure patients, but the small sample size and short duration limit the conclusions that can be drawn about arginine's impact on other types of cardiovascular disease.","We found only one small study that investigated a benefit that was noticeable for those affected. In patients with heart failure, taking arginine did not improve exercise tolerance or quality of life. Due to a lack of details, we cannot conclusively assess how reliable these results are.

Furthermore, long-term effects of cat's claw on these chronic diseases remain unclear due to insufficient data.","We found three small studies that investigated cat's claw in patients with rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis. The studies have significant flaws and sometimes come to contradictory results. Therefore, the question cannot be answered unequivocally."
Does platelet-rich plasma therapy (autologous blood therapy) reduce pain in osteoarthritis of the hip joint???,['Knees and hips are the large joints that are particularly affected and for which various injections are offered as therapy.'],2,"The sentences provided only mention knees and hips in general as joints affected by osteoarthritis and various injections offered as therapy, without specifying platelet-rich plasma therapy or its effect on pain in osteoarthritis of the hip joint.","Injections with platelet-rich plasma could slightly reduce pain in osteoarthritis of the knee. The therapy is apparently more effective than placebo treatment, but the effect is small.  For the hip, on the other hand, studies tend to point toward no efficacy. Local side effects are common. Which form of therapy is best for whom has not yet been clarified, and long-term success has not been studied."
"Does EMDR work similarly to exposure therapy, another well-studied form of psychotherapy for the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder???","['Perhaps as effective as established therapy We have also researched how well EMDR therapy works compared to well-established exposure therapy – a common form of psychotherapy for people with post-traumatic stress disorder.', 'There is evidence that EMDR works similarly well as established exposure therapy, i.e.', 'The comparison of EMDR and cognitive behavioral therapy suggests that both forms of therapy help similarly well.']",0,"The claim is partially supported by the sentences, as there is evidence suggesting that EMDR therapy has a similar effect to exposure therapy in treating post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms.",Therapy with EMDR is probably more effective than no therapy at all for people suffering from the psychological consequences of a traumatic experience. Its effectiveness may be similar to that of exposure therapy. This is a widely established and well-studied form of psychotherapy.
Does filling with hydrogel help with chronic back pain caused by a worn disc?,"['And as beautiful as the image of the ""gel-improved intervertebral disc"" may be, the theory is relatively shaky: the wear of the intervertebral disc does not have to be the cause of the back pain, even if it has been detected with X-ray, computer tomopgraphy (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).', 'Nor can the studies prove that Hydrogel can significantly improve the height of the intervertebral discs.', 'However, the studies cannot answer whether the pain would have improved without hydrogel – because none had a control group.']",1,"The studies do not establish a significant improvement in intervertebral disc height with hydrogel and cannot determine if pain would have improved without it, while also acknowledging that disc wear may not be the cause of back pain.",None of the studies to date can answer how well the treatment works - they lack conclusiveness for this. Some hydrogel products have since been withdrawn from the market.

Can the active ingredient acetyl salicylic acid (ASA) protect against cancer?,"['Minor reduction in cancer risk According to a recent systematic review [ 1 ], daily intake of ASA actually results in a minor reduction in cancer risk.', 'Among 1000 subjects who took ASA, 16 people died of cancer on average, while those who received only an ineffective dummy medication (placebo) were19.', 'In a cohort study over ten years, the intake of ASA only led to a reduced risk of colorectal cancer every other day, but also to increased gastrointestinal bleeding [5].']",0,"Daily intake of ASA results in a minor reduction in cancer risk, as indicated by a recent systematic review, with an average of 3 fewer cancer-related deaths per 1000 subjects compared to placebo, although increased gastrointestinal bleeding has been associated with ASA use.","Taking ASA daily for several years seems to be able to reduce the risk of dying from cancer somewhat. However, it increases the risk of severe internal bleeding and stomach problems."
Is tick-borne tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) much milder in children than in adults?,"['Although only 20 children participated in this study, there is a certain trend: young patients generally had less severe symptoms and recovered faster than adults.', 'Except for one case of complete vaccination and two cases of incomplete vaccination, the affected children were unvaccinated [11] and more frequently developed meningitis, while adults were more likely to fight with the more dangerous inflammation of the brain and cerebral membranes (meningo-encephalitis).']",0,"While unvaccinated children in this study more often developed meningitis and recovered faster than adults, they were also likely to experience meningo-encephalitis, suggesting that TBE severity may not be consistently milder in children than adults.","Current studies suggest that TBE is probably associated with milder symptoms in children than in adults. Permanent damage is also less frequent in younger patients. However, TBE can also have severe health consequences in children in individual cases."
Does condom use cause depression in women?,"['Like any contraceptive method, the condom has disadvantages that it causes depression in women, but is nowhere documented.', 'Maybe less fun We have not found a study that specifically investigated whether the use of condoms in sex can lead to depression in women.', 'If condoms were to promote depression, it would be unlikely that depression would decrease if used more frequently.', 'They have found no correlations between condom use and depression [4].', 'Risk factors for depression In any case, condoms cannot be found in the list of recognised risk factors.']",1,"The claim that condom use causes depression in women is not supported by the provided sentences, which state that there is no specific study or correlation found between condom use and depression, and condoms are not listed as a risk factor for depression.",A study examining exactly this question was not found. Some scientific works with a broad question rather lead to the conclusion that there is no connection between depression and condom use.
Does copper intake increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease?,"[""Because there are no studies that associate an increased uptake of copper directly with an increased Alzheimer's risk [6].""]",1,The claim that copper intake increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease is not supported by a study directly associating increased copper uptake with an increased Alzheimer's risk.,Some studies claim to have found links between high copper levels and Alzheimer's disease. Whether copper intake actually has an impact on Alzheimer's risk is not clear.
Do special garments with the active ingredient Liporeductyl help against cellulite?,"['An effect could not be found for any active substance [1].', 'Or, to put it more carefully, for none of the innumerable forms of treatment have well-derived scientific evidence that speaks for effectiveness.']",1,"The claim that special garments with Liporeductyl help against cellulite is not supported by scientific evidence, as no effect was found for any active substance and there is no well-derived scientific proof for the effectiveness of the numerous treatment forms.","There are only small studies that neither stand up to methodological criteria nor have been scientifically published. Sustained efficacy has not been proven, which, according to the current status, applies to all common remedies against cellulite."
Does alcohol in moderate amounts prolong life?,"['Alcohol: Beyond good and evil As described in our article on red wine, moderate alcohol consumption probably has a positive effect on cardiovascular health [2]; moderate means an alcoholic drink per day – a small beer or an eighth of wine.']",0,"Moderate alcohol consumption, as defined in the article, is associated with potential cardiovascular health benefits, but the claim that it prolongs life cannot be directly inferred from the provided sentences.","In moderate amounts, alcohol could reduce the likelihood of dying prematurely. In higher doses, however, it clearly increases this risk. This is unclear for caffeine."
Does light freezing help with weight loss?,"['Much speculation, little knowledge A scientific work taken up by many media does not help with this question [1].', 'Nevertheless, weight loss was not significantly higher than after the same exercise program at more pleasant temperatures.']",1,"While some media outlets have speculated about the impact of light freezing on weight loss, a scientific study found that weight loss after exercise at cold temperatures was not significantly different from that at more pleasant temperatures.","Some laboratory studies show that the body reacts to colder temperatures with higher energy consumption and burns more fat. Nevertheless, it is completely unclear whether this supports weight loss; that is, whether the process is strong enough and whether other mechanisms do not work against it. Weight loss through freezing has not been investigated in clinical studies."
Does virgin conception exist?,"['Until now, fertilization without sexual contact – biologists refer to it as parthenogenesis – is only known from a few animal species.', 'In humans, the phenomenon is hardly researched, the present study is the only scientific study on this subject so far.']",1,"While parthenogenesis, or fertilization without sexual contact, has been observed in a few animal species, there is limited research on this phenomenon in humans, with only one scientific study conducted so far.","To date, only one study has been conducted on this issue.

Can a treatment with singing bowls relieve pain?,"['The participants felt much more relaxed, calmer and better tuned both after the treatment and after the sham treatment.', 'An effect is therefore attributable solely to the placebo effect.']",2,"The first sentence indicates that the participants felt relaxed and calm after both the treatment and the sham treatment, suggesting that any effect is not due to the singing bowls but rather a placebo effect.",Singing bowl therapy does not appear to be effective for relieving pain.
Does religion promote mental health?,"['Nevertheless, the question is far from clear, for which there are a number of reasons: Hardly any significance religion, religiosity and spirituality can be distinguished from each other and also very difficult to measure.', 'It is almost impossible to bring together the results of the individual studies and, subsequently, the survey work.', 'The term ""religion"" is simply too comprehensive to be judged as a single factor.']",1,"The distinction between religion, religiosity, and spirituality, as well as the comprehensive nature and difficulty in measuring ""religion,"" make it challenging to determine a clear relationship between religion and mental health.","The studies do not allow any conclusion to be drawn for several reasons: the results are contradictory, only a few studies are by independent authors, and religion is not a concept that is measured uniformly; neither effects nor side effects can be clearly attributed to the factor ""religion"" because there is no such thing as a uniform factor ""religion."""
Does staining brain tumors with the dye aminolevulinic acid before surgery help patients survive longer?,"['Partial success, but increase in survival rate unclear For the use of aminolevulic acid especially in brain tumors, only a larger study was conducted [ 1 ].', 'It is unclear whether the operation with the aid of aminolevulic acid leads to a greater number of long-term cured patients.']",1,"While a study on aminolevulinic acid use in brain tumors was conducted, it remains unclear whether this leads to a higher number of long-term cured patients or an increase in survival rate.","Surgery of brain tumors stained with aminolevulinic acid is more complete than without staining. Although the tumor returned in fewer patients in the initial period after surgery, it is unclear whether the long-term survival rate is also greater."
"Can exercise prevent premature deaths from heart attacks, strokes, heart failure, and pre-diabetes as effectively as medication?","['However, the fact that sport alone can reduce the risk of death for people with a heart attack is not entirely certain [1].', 'However, the direct comparison between sports and medications clearly revealed the drug as the winner for people with heart failure: In the long-term use of dewatering drugs (diuretics), only about a quarter of so many patients died early than in regular exercise.', 'Sport beneficial, but no substitute for medication The analysis [1] provides first, cautious results.', 'The authors also point out that studies on sport are missing as an alternative treatment method.', 'It is still too early to say whether sport is suitable for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases or diabetes precursors instead of drugs.']",0,"While exercise shows benefits in reducing the risk of death from certain cardiovascular diseases and pre-diabetes, its preventative effect compared to medication is not definitively established, with some studies suggesting medication as more effective, particularly for heart failure.","An evaluation of several meta-analyses provides evidence that exercise can prevent premature death after stroke. After heart attacks or in cases of pre-diabetes, exercise appears to be similarly effective to the corresponding drugs. In the case of heart failure, however, medication is likely to be more effective. However, it is by no means possible to generalize from this that sport can replace medication."
Is the success of conventional treatment of a herniated disc equivalent to that of disc surgery?,"['The pain was shown to decrease faster after surgery than with conventional treatment methods.', 'Intervertebral disc surgery is also much more expensive than conventional therapy.', 'However, the scientific evidence that operations do not bring an advantage in the long term compared to conventional treatment methods is low, as there are few studies of high quality.']",0,"While studies suggest faster pain decrease after herniated disc surgery, high-quality evidence indicating long-term advantages over conventional treatment is limited.","Disc surgery leads to faster pain relief in the short term, but in most cases is unlikely to bring any long-term benefit compared to conventional therapy. It is also more expensive and somewhat riskier."
Does increased time outdoors inhibit myopia in children?,"['In most of these studies [ 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11 ], various research groups discovered a connection between the extent of shortsightedness and the time spent by children and adolescents in closed spaces rather than outdoors.', 'In two studies [ 8, 9 ] there was also no connection between increased outdoor activity and reduced short-sightedness.']",0,"While many studies suggest a link between reduced time outdoors and increased myopia in children, there are also studies that found no connection between increased outdoor activity and decreased short-sightedness.","There is probably a correlation between reduced myopia and outdoor activities. However, it is not possible to say beyond doubt whether increased time spent outdoors is actually the cause of reduced myopia. Various other factors also play a role in the development of myopia."
Do household cleaners and room fresheners in spray form cause damage to the heart?,"['Risk to the heart little investigated The impact of detergents or household sprays on the cardiovascular system has so far been little investigated.', 'In particular, there was a strong correlation between abnormal heart rhythm and the use of fresh cleaning and space sprays, while the regular use of other perfumed household products was not accompanied by an unusual pattern of heartbeat.', 'Whether household sprays can directly increase the risk for cardiovascular diseases, however, cannot be derived from this with certainty.', 'Conclusion Whether household cleaners can affect heart health is not yet certain, a study that not only investigates ECG abnormalities but also the actual incidence of cardiovascular diseases after regular household cleaner use would be necessary.']",1,"While a correlation was found between abnormal heart rhythms and the use of certain household sprays, the data does not conclusively establish a direct link between household cleaners and increased cardiovascular disease risk.","There is evidence that people who often use household sprays more often have asymptomatic abnormalities of the heart rhythm. However, whether these abnormalities will later lead to disease, and whether household sprays are actually the cause, remains to be determined by larger and longer studies. Many, but not all, studies also show a connection between the frequent use of cleaning agents and an increased risk of asthma - even if other causes of this respiratory disease cannot be completely ruled out."
Can stress promote dementia?,"['However, according to the Internet magazine Vorarlberg Online, stress is also the most common reason for the emergence of dementia.', 'However, studies suggest that permanent performance pressure as one of many factors could be partly responsible for the development of age dementia [1] [2] [3] [4].', 'This suggests that the subjectively perceived stress level is more decisive for the risk of dementia than the actual workload.', ""Diabetes, depression, elevated cholesterol levels and smoking are among the factors that could also favour Alzheimer's disease [6].""]",0,"The claim is partially supported by studies suggesting a link between chronic stress and age-related dementia, but other factors such as diabetes, depression, high cholesterol, and smoking may also contribute to the risk of Alzheimer's disease.","There is evidence that chronic stress in work and private life may increase the risk of dementia in old age. However, this needs to be confirmed by larger studies. However, stress is only one of many possible influences."
Does the risk for the unborn child to develop asthma later on increase if the mother is exposed to high pollen concentrations during pregnancy?,"['However, the association with the increased pollen exposure does not exclude other causes of the increased asthma risk.', 'There is uncertainty about the cause of allergies and, subsequently, asthma.']",1,"The claim does not exclusively attribute the increased asthma risk in the unborn child to high pollen concentrations during pregnancy, acknowledging other potential causes and the uncertainty around the cause of allergies and subsequent asthma.",It is not clear whether a child later has an increased risk of asthma if its mother has contact with large amounts of pollen during pregnancy. Studies to date on this are rare and in some cases show methodological weaknesses.  Studies conducted according to strict criteria would be necessary to answer this question unequivocally.
Are children conceived in May more likely to be born prematurely than children conceived in other months?,"['A new study [1] sees flu as a danger for children born in May.', 'The authors see the reason for the premature birth of children born in May as the occurrence of the flu.', 'So influenza could be the trigger for premature births born in May.', 'Premature births by temperature The meta-analysis [2] suggests that the time of birth may depend on the temperature.']",0,"The study and the authors' interpretation suggest a correlation between the flu occurring in May and an increased risk of premature births, but they do not definitively establish causation or rule out other factors that might influence the time of birth.","There are indications that children conceived in May are born prematurely. The reason for this could be the flu, which hits May babies the hardest. The temperature can also influence the time of birth."

Does the Toxoplasma gondii parasite affect suicide rates?,"['The study [1] cited in the newspaper article also finds a connection between infection and violence against mothers themselves, but this study cannot exclude possible other factors of influence.']",0,"The study mentioned does not definitively attribute increased suicide rates to Toxoplasma gondii infection, as it cannot rule out other influencing factors.","Meanwhile, some studies show a link between infection with the protozoan T. gondii and a higher suicide rate. However, it is not yet clear whether the parasite actually has an influence, because a third factor is also conceivable that influences both the infection rate and the suicide rate."
Do behavioral therapy methods help with specific fears (phobias) such as fear of spiders?,"['The basic principle of behavioral therapy in the treatment of phobias is the habit of getting used to fear.', 'The most effective is the direct confrontation with the fear trigger [1] [2] [3], i.e.']",0,"The direct confrontation with the fear trigger is a key behavioral therapy method for helping individuals overcome specific fears such as fear of spiders, according to the provided sentences.","Yes, the most effective method is confrontation therapy.

Do mindfulness-based methods effect improvement in chronic pain?,"['4 of the 7 studies (Teixeica 2010, Morone 2009, Plews-Ogan 2005 and Wong 2009) could not detect any benefit from the treatment of chronic pain with mindfulness-based methods compared to sham therapy, ordinary pain treatment or information presentations.', 'Although the results of a study (by Morone in 2008) indicated no improvement in pain perception through a mindfulness-based program, patients with chronic back pain could better accept their pain at the end of the 8-week therapy.', 'Mindfulness-based meditation and methods based on mindfulness-based stress reduction seem to be able to make pain more bearable in some cases.', 'The effectiveness of mindfulness-based therapies for the treatment of chronic pain is therefore uncertain.']",1,"While several studies found no improvement in pain perception through mindfulness-based methods, some reported better acceptance of pain, suggesting a possible impact on making pain more bearable in certain cases, which leaves the overall effectiveness uncertain.","Some clinical studies suggest an efficacy of mindfulness-based methods for pain management, but several other studies cannot confirm such an effect. A definitive answer could come from studies with a larger number of participants."
Do general health checkups lead to longer life?,"['Thus, general health checks do not provide a longer life.', 'The authors of the review work [1] thus attest to health checks that they miss their goal – a healthier population.']",2,"The claim that general health checkups lead to a longer life is refuted by the statements indicating that health checks fail to achieve their goal of a healthier population, as asserted by the authors of review [1].",Health screenings for adults from the general population do not have the hoped-for effect: participants do not live longer as a result of serial screening and preventive care.
Can vitamin supplements protect against life-threatening diseases such as cancer or cardiovascular disease?,"['People who have no nutrient deficiency and are otherwise healthy will not benefit from the intake of vitamin preparations.', 'Possible exception Vitamin D An exception with many limitations is only vitamin D.

Taking beta-carotene and possibly vitamin E may actually increase the likelihood of premature death. The only exception is vitamin D supplements; they are likely to have a small life-prolonging effect in the elderly."
Is it true that lowering cholesterol does not reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease?,"['Study participants who consumed less salt and fat, but more fruits, vegetables and fiber, were able to lower their LDL cholesterol levels and blood pressure slightly.', 'Especially a Mediterranean diet with lots of fruits, vegetables, nuts, olive oil and fish as well as little red meat and dairy products seems to have a positive effect on heart health.', 'However, this does not mean that all cholesterol-lowering agents automatically reduce the cardiovascular risk.', 'Cholesterol only one of many heart risk factors Cholesterol is by no means the only factor that increases the likelihood of cardiovascular diseases such as heart attack or stroke.', 'Quitting smoking also significantly reduces the risk, even if it does not affect cholesterol levels.']",2,"The claim is refuted by the first sentence indicating a correlation between lowering LDL cholesterol levels and blood pressure through a specific diet, suggesting that managing cholesterol can contribute to reducing cardiovascular disease risk.","No. High cholesterol, along with other risk factors, can increase the likelihood of cardiovascular disease. If the proportion of ""bad"" LDL cholesterol in the blood is lowered (with medication or through a change in diet), the risk of diseases such as heart attack or stroke also decreases."
Do static magnets help against pain?,"['Magnets are pure magic – with an invisible hand they attract something, push each other off and in a large style they even let whole moves float.', 'Does the magic of magnets also affect the human body?', 'There they are supposed to calm pain, heal wounds, protect against joint wear (arthrosis) or simply improve the general well-being.', 'Effekt refuted In 2007, an overview of the studies on magnets against pain was summarized [1] : The result shows that magnets do not work better than a sham treatment (placebo).', 'The question is important in that it is estimated that almost a third of all osteoarthritis patients in the USA use magnets in some form [1].']",2,The claim that static magnets help against pain is refuted by a 2007 overview of studies which found that magnets do not work better than a sham treatment for pain.,Both a somewhat older review and several high-quality randomized controlled trials show that magnets do not work better than sham treatment.
