Does paxlovid protect unvaccinated people with risk factors from severe or even fatal covid 19 disease?,"['Patients at risk without corona vaccination appear to be well protected from serious to fatal events by Paxlovid.', 'However, it is not certain how well Paxlovid helps people who have already received corona vaccination.', 'In addition, the scientists investigated whether Paxlovid alleviated the Covid-19 symptoms, shortened the duration of the disease and reduced the need for medical treatment: Half of the participants improved the symptoms with Paxlovid after 13 days, with placebo after 15 days.', 'With Paxlovid, 14 out of 1000 participants needed medical treatment for Covid-19 within a month, with placebo 76 out of 1000.', 'Whether with or without antibodies in the blood, Paxlovid basically protected all humans from a severe course.']",0,"Paxlovid appears to provide significant protection against severe outcomes from COVID-19 for unvaccinated individuals at risk, as indicated by the data showing a marked reduction in the need for medical treatment compared to placebo.","In a large, well-done study, paxlovid prevented hospitalizations and deaths in high-risk patients. They were unvaccinated and had contracted the delta variant. For vaccinated people, the benefit cannot be reliably estimated. This also applies to people with immunodeficiency."
Does the consumption of soy foods or soy isoflavones affect the appearance of acne skin?,"['In both cases, certain soya ingredients are responsible for the effect on the skin: the isoflavones.', 'There are two competing theories that contradict each other: according to the first theory, isoflavones confuse the hormone balance and are supposed to promote acne in this way.', 'Surprisingly, despite searching in two large databases, we could not find a study on soy products and acne – whether soy milk, soy sauce or tofu.', 'The isoflavones improved the skin appearance more than an anti-acne cream with vitamin A acid (Tretinoin).', 'Conclusion: There is currently no evidence from reliable studies that soy makes acne worse.']",1,"The sentences indicate that while there are theories about soy isoflavones potentially affecting hormone balance and promoting acne, there is no conclusive evidence from reliable studies linking soy foods or isoflavones to worsening acne, and some evidence suggests they may even improve skin appearance.","We could not find any meaningful studies at all on the influence of soy foods on acne. On soy isoflavones, we found two small studies of questionable quality that examined a very specific group of sufferers. Soy isoflavones improved the skin appearance somewhat. However, this result is not reliable."
Does regular HPV testing in addition to the recommended Pap smear detect more precancerous lesions than just the Pap smear alone?,"['According to the studies, the HPV test is likely to detect slightly more precursors of cervical cancer over several years than the PAP swab alone.', 'We are therefore relatively sure that with an additional HPV test at least a little more precursors of uterine cancer are detected than only with the PAP swab alone.']",0,"The sentences indicate that the HPV test is likely to detect more precursors of cervical cancer compared to the Pap smear alone, suggesting that the combination of both tests may enhance detection of precancerous lesions.","Regular examination of the cervix by means of PAP smear tests detects precancerous stages of the cervix in most cases in good time. This reduces the risk of developing cervical cancer. An additional HPV test every three to five years can make screening even more reliable. However, the difference should not be too great."
Can olive leaf extract reduce high blood pressure?,"['These studies therefore do not indicate whether olive leaf extract can help with significantly increased blood pressure.', 'Without success, however, we could not find any studies that investigated the effect of olive leaf extract on cardiovascular health.', 'However, they cannot provide clear answers.', 'It is therefore impossible to say whether olive leaves extract could have a better or worse effect with significantly increased blood pressure.']",1,"The provided sentences indicate a lack of studies investigating the effect of olive leaf extract on high blood pressure, making it unclear whether it can help with this condition.","Whether olive leaf extract lowers blood pressure has been investigated in five suitable studies to date. They all found no effect or only a slight effect of the extract. The problem with this is that most of the study participants had only slightly elevated blood pressure. They cannot answer how olive leaf extract works in people with significantly elevated blood pressure (hypertension). The studies also had gross flaws, few participants, and ran for a very short time. They cannot provide reliable answers."
Do green-lipped mussel preparations improve the symptoms of osteoarthritis?,"['Studies overall not meaningful The conclusion of our research: Scientific evidence for the claimed effect is missing.', 'It is also unclear whether the measured positive effects are large enough to actually be felt by those affected.', 'Whether or not green-lipped mussel helps with osteoarthritis cannot be said at the moment.', 'However, as early as 2009, the European Food Safety Authority considered that a protective effect of the green-lipped mussel on healthy joints has not been established.', 'In our opinion, no reliable conclusions can be drawn from the studies found.']",1,"The available research indicates a lack of scientific evidence supporting the effectiveness of green-lipped mussel preparations for improving osteoarthritis symptoms, with previous assessments also failing to establish any protective effects on joint health.","The question was examined in four small studies with serious methodological deficiencies, which also arrived at partly contradictory results. No clear conclusions can be drawn from them. The claim that green-lipped mussel helps with osteoarthritis is not scientifically proven."
Can laser irradiation of blood by infusion needle (hemolaser treatment) relieve discomfort or help with diseases?,"['It is also unclear by what mechanism blood irradiation with bundled red light – i.e.', 'red laser – should improve health.', 'Although the authors of the three studies found [1-3] claim to have established a clear efficacy of haemolaser treatment, none of the three studies is suitable to prove this.']",1,"The sentences indicate that the mechanism by which hemolaser treatment could improve health is unclear, and the studies claiming its efficacy are not suitable for proving this, suggesting insufficient information to support the claim.",There is no scientific evidence that hemolaser treatment has a palliative or curative effect on health problems.
Can CBD help with period pain?,"['Because despite searching in three different databases we could not find a single study on CBD in case of regular pain.', 'Scientifically, it is not sufficiently researched whether CBD actually promotes sleep, as providers claim.', 'The studies in detail We could not find any studies that investigated whether CBD can help with normal pain – neither for treatment nor for prevention.']",1,The lack of studies investigating the effects of CBD on regular pain indicates that there is insufficient scientific evidence to determine whether CBD can help with period pain.,Whether CBD can relieve menstrual pain has apparently never been scientifically studied. We could not find any studies on this. Women who suffer from severe period pain should talk to a gynecologist about it. Diseases such as endometriosis could be behind it.
"Does the Zisano bracelet strengthen the immune system, increase endurance and performance or reduce fatigue?","['Whether such bracelets have an effect, for example whether they can actually increase physical performance or strengthen the immune system, has apparently never been investigated.', 'Bracelets for more performance: studies show ineffectiveness All five studies came to the same conclusion: the bracelets had no effect on the performance or well-being of the subjects.', 'A scientifically plausible explanation as to how exactly such bracelets should develop their effect remains to be found in their suppliers.', 'The studies in detail We could not find any studies on the Zisano bracelet or comparable bracelets with silicon chip.']",1,"The provided sentences indicate that there is no scientific investigation or evidence supporting the claim that the Zisano bracelet can strengthen the immune system, increase endurance and performance, or reduce fatigue.","The promised positive effects of the ""Powerband"" wristband on health and well-being have apparently not been scientifically studied. We could not find any studies on this. It is also unclear how the wristband is supposed to work in concrete terms. A scientifically plausible explanation is missing."
"Does microimmunotherapy improve symptoms of allergies, cancer, joint inflammation, autoimmune diseases, dementia or various viral infections?","['None of these studies are meaningful – because they are poorly carried out and the published data are incomplete.', 'They cannot give any indication of the benefits of microimmune therapy.', 'Entitled doubts Since microimmune therapy preparations are highly diluted as homeopathic agents, we have fundamental doubts about the method.']",1,"The provided sentences indicate that the studies on microimmunotherapy are poorly conducted and lack meaningful data, raising fundamental doubts about its efficacy for conditions like allergies, cancer, and autoimmune diseases.","So far, studies seem to exist only on microimmunotherapy against hay fever and cancer. Their significance is far too low to conclude that the therapy is effective. We found no studies on other health problems. Thus, there is no proven benefit of microimmunotherapy for any disease."
Does transcranial pulse stimulation (TPS) improve mental performance in people with Alzheimer's dementia? Can the treatment improve the quality of life of those affected?,"['Therefore, we do not consider the study results to be meaningful.', ""Transcranial pulse stimulation: not recognized as Alzheimer's therapy Even if providers of transcranial pulse stimulation claim otherwise: as therapy, the treatment with ultrasound in dementia is neither researched nor recognized."", 'There are currently no studies that can prove that it can help people with dementia in the short term or in the long term.', 'None of the studies can answer whether transcranial pulse stimulation or similar procedures help people with dementia.']",1,"Transcranial pulse stimulation is not recognized as a therapy for Alzheimer's dementia, and there is currently no research demonstrating its effectiveness in improving mental performance or quality of life for those affected.",Whether transcranial pulse stimulation can help people with Alzheimer's dementia has not yet been investigated in meaningful studies. Possible harmful effects have also been insufficiently researched.
Does CBD (cannabidiol) relieve symptoms of mild to moderate covid-19 disease?,"[""We can't say with absolute certainty that CBD is ineffective at Covid-19, but we think it is reasonably probable."", 'In addition, there is evidence from other studies that CBD may even increase the susceptibility to infection [4].', 'Although she appears in some media reports, the report is simply wrong that the researchers had demonstrated an anti-corona effect of CBD in their study: According to the research team, CBD had no effect on the corona virus in the experiments.', 'No benefit from CBD After 28 days, the study team took stock: Overall, the participants of the CBD group felt no better than those of the placebo group.']",2,"The provided sentences indicate that CBD has not demonstrated any beneficial effects on COVID-19 symptoms, with studies showing no improvement compared to placebo and even suggesting potential increased susceptibility to infection.","CBD is unlikely to have any effect on the symptoms of covid-19 disease. This is the conclusion of the only study that has investigated this. However, its validity is somewhat limited due to the small number of participants. Not explored is a possible preventive effect. It is unclear whether CBD or other cannabis constituents - ingested or smoked - protect against corona infection or covid-19 disease."
Do infusions of vitamin C relieve symptoms of chronic fatigue or long covid?,"['It is also unclear whether people with Long Covid benefit from vitamin C infusions.', 'One of the two authors is also an employee of a pharmaceutical company that also offers products with vitamin C.  Since the developmental mechanisms of both chronic fatigue syndrome and long covid are unclear, studies with cancer patients or healthy participants cannot provide answers to the question whether vitamin C can help people with chronic fatigue syndrome or long covid.']",1,"The sentences indicate uncertainty regarding the benefits of vitamin C infusions for individuals with Long Covid or chronic fatigue syndrome, highlighting the lack of clarity in existing studies.",Whether vitamin C infusions help with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is questionable. This has not yet been scientifically investigated. We also could not find a single study on vitamin C and fatigue occurring in the context of Long Covid.
Does mistletoe therapy help against cancer or can it improve the quality of life of cancer patients?,"['It is currently unclear whether cancer sufferers live longer or better due to mistletoe therapy.', 'No longer survival time detectable The analysis of the previously published survival studies [1] shows that overall mistletoe therapy does not seem to be able to prolong the lifetime of cancer patients.', 'In order to prove this, meaningful studies are still missing – even after about a hundred years.The studies in detail We looked for overviews in three different databases, which summarize the current study situation on mistletoe therapy in cancer.']",1,"The sentences indicate that there is no clear evidence supporting the effectiveness of mistletoe therapy in prolonging the life or improving the quality of life for cancer patients, highlighting a lack of meaningful studies on the subject.","Mistletoe therapy for cancer has been investigated in some studies. However, these are very poor and come to inconsistent results. They cannot prove that mistletoe therapy is effective. In addition, there is a suspicion that mistletoe preparations may even stimulate tumor growth in some types of cancer."
Can regular exercise prevent you from getting a cold or other respiratory infections???,"['People who practice sports on a regular basis are likely to suffer as often from respiratory infections as sports muffles.', 'The studies suggest that although the number of infections can not be reduced by sport, it may be a little milder for the duration of the disease and for the duration of the disease as a whole.']",2,"The sentences indicate that regular exercise does not significantly reduce the frequency of respiratory infections, although it may lead to milder symptoms, which does not support the claim that exercise can prevent colds or respiratory infections.","Previous studies suggest that sports-playing people may be just as likely to have respiratory infections as sports-muffle people. However, the illnesses are likely to be somewhat less severe and a bit shorter overall."
Does coenzyme Q10 relieve muscle discomfort during treatment with statins?,"['In seven studies, the coenzyme Q10 group was no better than the placebo group.', 'When the research team removed this study from the overall evaluation, the remaining studies came together to a relatively similar result: Coenzyme Q10 does not help better than a sham medication.']",1,The provided sentences indicate that coenzyme Q10 does not show any significant benefit over a placebo in relieving muscle discomfort during statin treatment.,"Several studies come to contradictory results. In addition, the range of variation in the estimated effect is very large, and the individual studies have certain shortcomings. On this basis, no firm conclusions can be drawn."
Can taking vitamin C after the onset of a cold relieve symptoms or shorten the illness?,"['Symptom treatment probably without effect The recommendation to take high-dose vitamin C at the first signs of a cold cannot be confirmed by studies.', 'The combined results of previous studies do not show that vitamin C can relieve cold symptoms.']",2,"The sentences indicate that studies do not confirm the effectiveness of high-dose vitamin C in relieving cold symptoms or shortening the illness, directly contradicting the claim.","Preventive intake of high-dose vitamin C for a long time does not prevent the occurrence of colds. However, it can reduce the average duration of illness by half a day to a day from a week. Vitamin C is unlikely to improve a cold that has already occurred."
Can taking spermidine prolong life? Can it prevent diseases?,"['Whether spermidine absorbed by food or as a capsule has a life-extending effect in humans, such attempts cannot answer – man differs too much from worms and flies.', 'Spermidine from capsules: unexplored However, we have found no studies at all on the life-prolonging effect of spermidine as a dietary supplement.']",1,"The sentences indicate that there is no scientific evidence supporting the life-extending effects of spermidine in humans, whether from food or supplements, leaving the claim unverified.","No study has yet investigated whether spermidine in the form of dietary supplements helps people live longer or healthier. There are two observational studies on the influence of a spermidine-rich diet on life expectancy. However, their results are not conclusive."
Can green tea protect against coronavirus infection or help treat covid-19?,"['Thus, it cannot be proven (or ruled out) that green tea protects against Corona infection or can relieve covid-19 disease.', 'Whether the green tea substances concentrate sufficiently in those body cells that are infected by the corona virus is also unclear.', 'We have described what we know about the effectiveness of Gurgel solutions against SARS-CoV-2 in our own article.The studies in detail We have not found any studies that have investigated the effects of green tea on patients with Covid-19.']",1,"The sentences indicate that there is no conclusive evidence to support the claim that green tea can protect against coronavirus infection or aid in treating COVID-19, as studies specifically investigating its effects on patients with the virus have not been found.","So far, this has not been verified in studies with humans. Such an effect is therefore unclear."
Does vitamin D alleviate autism symptoms in children?,"['But we could not find any evidence of positive effects on autism.', 'Medicines for the treatment of autism-typical symptoms do not exist [9].The studies in detail We wanted to know whether vitamin D can alleviate the most important symptoms of autism: Are there any improvements in social and communication behaviour?', 'The combined results [1] of the two studies [10.11] do not indicate that vitamin D can improve communication or rigid, repetitive behavioural patterns, whether alone or in combination with omega-3 fatty acids.', 'Overall, the results of the four studies do not give a solid indication that vitamin D helps children with autism.', 'Since only a few children have participated, the results are hardly comparable and partly contradict each other, the significance of the previous studies is small – that is, we can neither prove nor exclude a positive effect.']",1,"The provided sentences indicate that multiple studies have not found evidence supporting the idea that vitamin D alleviates autism symptoms in children, suggesting a lack of conclusive information on the claim.","Studies on the subject are sparse and inconclusive. Even if individual studies claim to have observed positive effects, their results are unclear and contradictory. A strong improvement of autism symptoms was not shown in any of the previous studies."
Does glutathione improve the tolerability of chemotherapy for cancer?,"['Therefore, we cannot make statements about glutathione as a dietary supplement for swallowing, the effect of glutathione in other chemotherapys (without platinum) or in relation to other side effects.', 'Therefore, our conclusion: We cannot confirm or exclude that glutathione infusions mitigate or prevent nerve damage as a side effect of platinum-containing chemotherapy.', 'Thus, no conclusions can be drawn about the potential later use of glutathione.']",1,"The provided sentences indicate that there is insufficient evidence to determine whether glutathione improves the tolerability of chemotherapy, particularly in relation to its effects on nerve damage and other side effects.","Eight studies have examined whether glutathione can mitigate or prevent nerve damage during platinum-containing chemotherapy. But unfortunately, they do not allow reliable conclusions to be drawn: The studies were rather small, used different measurement tools, and came to contradictory results."
"Does amygdalin, the toxin from the seeds of apricots and other stone fruits, help against cancer?","['Unscientific myth In fact, there is no evidence of a cancer healing or preventive effect.', 'We do not know any meaningful study in which the anti-cancer effect of apricots or the amygdalin contained therein has been investigated [1].', 'So there is no evidence of an effect against cancer.']",1,"The claim that amygdalin helps against cancer is contradicted by the sentences, which state there is no evidence of any cancer healing or preventive effect from amygdalin or apricots.","It is a myth that eating bitter apricot seeds can cure or prevent cancer. Instead, it has been proven that the amygdalin contained in them is toxic. Eating bitter apricot seeds can cause severe poisoning, sometimes fatal."
Does garlic protect against a cold (chill)??,"['Small study, no safety In terms of cold (""cooling""), we found only one evaluable study, which was relatively small [1].']",1,"The sentences indicate that there is only one small study evaluating garlic's effect on colds, which does not provide sufficient evidence to support the claim that garlic protects against a cold.","We could not find a single meaningful study on the protective effect of garlic against Corona infections. There is no scientific basis for such claims. On the question of whether garlic protects against colds, we were able to evaluate only one study. However, this is relatively small and has gross weaknesses. The supposedly positive result is therefore not reliable."
"Does colloidal silver (""silver water"") work against infection with the coronavirus or other pathogens? Does it have any other health benefits?","['Whether drinking colloidal silver can do something about pathogens such as coronavirus has never been seriously investigated.', 'However, it cannot be concluded that colloidal silver also acts against pathogens in the human body.', 'And even if: Whether the silver concentration there would be sufficiently high to kill pathogens on the one hand and at the same time not cause serious side effects is also questionable.']",1,"The claim regarding the effectiveness of colloidal silver against pathogens like coronavirus is not supported by serious investigation, and there are concerns about its safety and efficacy in the human body.","Whether colloidal silver can cure infections with the coronavirus and other diseases or has a preventive effect has never been investigated in meaningful studies. Claims about the effectiveness of silver water are therefore made up out of thin air. What is certain, however, is that colloidal silver can discolor the skin blue-gray when the metal particle solution is drunk."
Is whole-body vibration therapy effective in preventing bone fractures in osteoporosis sufferers?,"['However, we could not find a single study in which researchers evaluated whether osteoporosis suffers from rare (or frequent) bone fractures with vibration training.', 'Read more about osteoporosis on the pages of Gesundheitsinformation.de [4].The studies in detail We could not find any studies that investigated whether vibration training is effective to reduce the risk of bone fractures in people with osteoporosis.', 'The review therefore does not allow any direct conclusions on the risk of bone fracture in osteoporosis.']",1,"The sentences indicate a lack of studies evaluating the effectiveness of whole-body vibration therapy in reducing the risk of bone fractures among osteoporosis sufferers, suggesting insufficient information to support the claim.","We did not find any studies that investigated whether vibration training affects the risk of bone fractures in people with osteoporosis.

"Does the product ""BestProvita Diabetin"" improve blood glucose levels in type 2 diabetes or does it prevent secondary diseases?","['Disappointing result Our research in three scientific literature databases was quite fast in the sand for the preparation ""BestProvita Diabetin: We did not find a single study that would have tested a food supplement with this composition.', 'So whether the capsules have the promised effect cannot be assessed.']",1,"The lack of scientific studies testing ""BestProvita Diabetin"" means that its effectiveness in improving blood glucose levels or preventing secondary diseases in type 2 diabetes cannot be determined.","Neither for the product ""BestProvita Diabetin"" nor for the particularly touted ingredient blueberry could we find meaningful studies."
Do blueberries improve blood sugar levels in type 2 diabetes or do they prevent secondary diseases?,"['No ""blue miracle"" Similarly disappointing ended our search for the benefit of blueberries in type 2 diabetes: The scientific literature cited by the provider on his website is not particularly meaningful for the alleged benefit.', 'We could not find a single meaningful study on blueberry in type 2 diabetes.', 'Whether blueberries in type 2 diabetes actually improve metabolism or protect against consequential damage, we cannot therefore assess.', 'This also applies to studies on blueberry – we could not discover well-made studies on a positive effect for diabetics.']",1,The provided sentences indicate a lack of meaningful scientific studies demonstrating that blueberries improve blood sugar levels or prevent secondary diseases in type 2 diabetes.,"Neither for the product ""BestProvita Diabetin"" nor for the particularly touted ingredient blueberry could we find meaningful studies."
Does hydroxychloroquine reduce the likelihood of dying from covid-19 disease?,"['On the contrary, the study results leave open the possibility that hydroxychloroquine even slightly increases the risk of death.', 'For prevention and treatment useless Both analyses [1,2] come to the sobering result: The fact that hydroxychloroquine reduces the risk of death by Covid-19 is almost impossible.', 'The same conclusion was also made by a comprehensive review of Cochrane Collaboration [4]: The nine randomized controlled studies included in it also show no effect of hydroxychloroquine on the risk of dying of Covid-19.']",2,"The provided sentences indicate that hydroxychloroquine does not reduce the risk of death from covid-19, with some studies suggesting it may even increase the risk.","The results of all studies to date preclude hydroxychloroquine from preventing deaths in covid-19 patients. The drug also does not appear to attenuate the disease. A preventive effect is also unlikely, according to the study results. It is well documented that hydroxychloroquine has side effects.

Can FGXpress Power Strips reduce pain or improve wound healing?,"['The pointless claim of detoxification and detoxification is also made.', 'Many of the promises require studies: whether and in which cases pain can be reduced and which wounds can be better cured would have to be proven by a manufacturer in studies.', 'To our knowledge, however, there is not a single study on FGXPress Power Strips.', 'Although the manufacturer shows before/after images with a thermal camera, without accurate documentation and control by outsiders, this is completely worthless.']",1,The lack of any studies on FGXpress Power Strips and the need for manufacturer-proven evidence regarding pain reduction and wound healing indicate that the claim remains unverified.,We could not find a single study on these patches - nor any reason to assume that they are effective.
Are there effective alternatives to the breathing mask (CPAP) for sleep apnea?,"['The authors of an overview of 2013 see such interventions as a possible alternative for those patients who reject the breathing mask: During the day of fatigue they lead to a similar improvement as standard therapy, but they are not so good at reducing breath loss [2].', 'However, since the breath loss has a decisive influence on subsequent diseases, standard therapy is preferable if possible.', 'Overall, oxygen therapy is significantly less helpful than CPAP [3].', 'Conclusion For patients who reject standard therapy with breathing mask, there are numerous other treatment options available – but these are not as effective in the decisive symptoms as CPAP.']",2,"The sentences indicate that while there are alternatives to CPAP for sleep apnea, they are generally less effective in addressing the critical symptoms compared to the breathing mask, suggesting that CPAP remains the preferred treatment option.","Although numerous other forms of treatment are available, some of them are too little researched or are clearly inferior to the standard therapy with CPAP."
Does taking magnesium salts decrease the frequency and intensity of muscle cramps with unknown cause?,"['Insufficient evidence The examination shows that the evidence of efficacy is rather meager: We have not found any high-quality studies that have investigated the effect of magnesium salts on exertive muscle spasms, for example in athletes.', 'It is therefore unclear whether athletes benefit from the intake of magnesium supplements.']",2,"The sentences indicate a lack of high-quality studies on the effect of magnesium salts on muscle cramps, making it unclear whether they provide any benefit for this condition.","No high-quality studies have been found on the efficacy of magnesium salts for exercise-induced muscle cramps, such as in athletes. For leg muscle cramps without an identifiable cause, researchers have been unable to demonstrate any effect of magnesium beyond placebo in studies. Pregnant women may benefit from magnesium supplements, but this evidence is not very robust."
Does brain training boost intelligence?,"['Those who train their memory only get better in these exercises, i.e.', 'The training does not affect other mental tasks such as speech fluid or arithmetic.', 'With a total of only 75 participants it is not very extensive, but strengthens the results of the overview work: even here, a 20-unit training did not improve the general intelligence [2].', 'Another review of 2013 casts doubt on how much cognitive training can be helpful for children and adolescents with various mental developmental disorders [3].']",2,"The sentences indicate that brain training primarily improves specific memory exercises without enhancing overall intelligence or other cognitive tasks, suggesting that it does not boost intelligence.","There are many ways of brain training, but no evidence that it can improve intelligence. The most research in science is about a specific training of the ""working memory"", here the studies speak against a general improvement of intelligence."
Does petroleum help against cancer?,"['One of the legends of Petroleum says that the workers in oil fields do not have cancer.', 'The legend is not confirmed; large studies show that cancers in oil workers are as common as in other parts of the population [1] [2] [3], the risk of cancer is neither greater nor less for workers in the oil industry.', '[a] In Internet forums, kerosene is praised as a curative detox, but this can be thought of as ""detoxins"", we have already described here: https://www.medizin-transparent.at/mdzt4n5p4rnt/detox-of-mythos-vom-detoxins Studies in detail There are no studies on kerosene as a drug for cancer – for good reason, because a positive effect is far less likely than an additional health risk.']",1,"The sentences indicate that there is no confirmed evidence supporting the claim that petroleum helps against cancer, as studies show that cancer rates among oil workers are similar to those in the general population and there are no studies validating kerosene as a cancer treatment.","This rather absurd assumption has not been tested in studies. Since petroleum is more likely to pose a health hazard, such studies are also not conducted."
Does the drug Sovaldi (sofosbuvir) enable high cure rates for chronic hepatitis C?,"['Studies show that the new drug significantly increases treatment success: In patients who have not received treatment before, the chances of healing are now above 90 percent according to most studies [1] [2] [3] [a].', 'The active substance of Sovaldi (sofosbuvir) is very successful in most of these patient groups, although not all groups have the same evidence [1] [2].', 'In any case, Sovaldi and other agents that directly attack the virus have revolutionized the treatment of hepatitis C and studies are currently underway to test the different combinations of drugs in different patient groups.']",0,"The sentences indicate that Sovaldi (sofosbuvir) has significantly increased treatment success rates for chronic hepatitis C, with healing rates exceeding 90% in treatment-naive patients, suggesting it enables high cure rates.","Yes, in combination with drugs that have been available for some time, cure rates of over 90 percent are possible with sofosbuvir. However, there are many different patient groups, and success rates are not the same for all."
Does bioresonance therapy help with health complaints?,"['In this regard, the Commission refers primarily to physical opinions which allegedly show that the basic principles of bioresonance are incorrect [1], but also mentions three clinical studies which have shown ineffectiveness.', 'What to Know About Bioresonance There are no meaningful studies that certify efficacy of bioresonance, while two small clinical studies clearly speak against [7] [9].', 'The studies in detail The three studies already mentioned in the position name clearly show, on the one hand, that the method is not suitable for diagnosing allergies [8], on the other hand, they are only partly meaningful as a verification of efficacy – simply due to the low number of participants [7] [9].', 'Since 2006, some studies have been published, which allegedly speak for bioresonance, but most of them are scientifically worthless.']",2,"The provided sentences indicate that there is a lack of meaningful studies supporting the efficacy of bioresonance therapy, with several studies demonstrating its ineffectiveness, particularly in diagnosing allergies.","Good studies on the question are hard to find. Due to the lack of proof of efficacy, the risk of misdiagnosis and the lack of plausibility, professional associations have been warning against bioresonance for some time."
Do irradiations with cold red light help with chronic gingivitis?,"['Few studies, no effect The few studies published so far indicate, however, that cold red light cannot effectively relieve such inflammations [1] [2] [3].', 'The fact that cold red light is intended to reduce pain after dental surgery can also not prove previous research results [4].', 'In none of these, the participating researchers were able to find an additional benefit of cold red light irradiation for the usual periodontitis treatment.', 'The summary analysis of existing studies does not indicate that cold red light can alleviate the consequences of dental surgery.']",2,The available studies indicate that cold red light does not provide any additional benefits for treating chronic gingivitis or related dental issues.,Previous studies indicate that chronic gingivitis and inflammation after dental surgery do not improve with irradiation with cold red light.
Does bisphenol A trigger allergies?,"['Hormone-like substances on the pill For BPA, the evidence of an allergy-promoting effect is currently not very strong.', 'The same study, which showed no correlation between the once measured BPA value in urine and existing allergies, found such association with the triclosan concentration in urine [2].']",1,"The sentences indicate that the evidence for bisphenol A promoting allergies is currently weak and that a study found no correlation between BPA levels in urine and existing allergies, suggesting insufficient information to confirm the claim.","Individual observational studies suggest an association between bisphenol A intake and the development of asthma, but not allergy, in early childhood. Asthma is often the consequence of allergy. However, the measurement of bisphenol A intake in these studies is too imprecise for a clear statement."
Does particulate matter pollution increase the risk of heart attack - even if the EU limits are complied with?,"['The study of over 367,000 adults from 13 European countries indicates that long-term exposure to particulate matter generally increases the risk of mortality – meaning life-saving [1].', ""The authors reported that long-term exposure to particulate matter at the place of residence makes the occurrence of heart attack and unstable angina pectoris ('heart', a sign of an imminent heart attack) more likely."", 'An English cohort study from 2013 could not deduce a link between heart attack risk and fine dust air pollution, but fine dust exposure increased the risks of other heart diseases.', 'The short-term inhalation of larger amounts of fine dust may also make a heart attack more likely.']",0,"Long-term exposure to particulate matter is associated with an increased likelihood of heart attacks, despite some studies not finding a direct link, indicating that compliance with EU limits may not eliminate the risk.","Recent studies from Europe indicate that everyday exposure to particulate matter may increase the risk of acute heart disease (myocardial infarction, angina pectoris). General mortality may also be increased already by 'allowed' long-term exposure within the current EU limits."
Are endocrine disruptors in cosmetics a health risk?,"['Thus, the risk for parabens is not demonstrated by clinical studies, especially not by cosmetics.', 'Many chemicals are not researched at all, the interaction with certain diseases is unknown and it is also not sufficiently clear when and how endocrine disruptors intervene in the physical development of adolescents [b].', 'Humans are therefore exposed to many such influences, which makes risk assessment very difficult.']",1,"The sentences indicate that the risk of parabens in cosmetics is not demonstrated by clinical studies, and there is a lack of research on many chemicals, making it difficult to assess the health risks of endocrine disruptors in cosmetics.","Although many cosmetics do indeed contain substances that can influence the hormone system, a health risk has not been proven. Ecological consequences, on the other hand, have already been demonstrated."
Does eye training help prevent myopia?,"['A systematic review did not find a controlled study in 2005 that could show an effect of eye training on shortsightedness – nor any that would suggest a preventive effect of eye training [1].', 'For other forms of falseness, there are also small and methodologically weak studies that find no difference between eye training and a control group [1].', 'But in most cases there is no evidence of the effect of visual training [1] [3].']",2,"The sentences indicate that systematic reviews and studies have not found evidence supporting the effectiveness of eye training in preventing myopia, suggesting that eye training does not help in this regard.","According to the current state of studies, an effectiveness of eye training can only be expected for very few diseases; an effect as prevention or therapy against myopia cannot be assumed at present."
"Does treatment with cyanoacrylate (for example, Sapheon Venaseal™) help against varicose veins as well or better than other methods?","['There are other scientific studies to close varicose veins with cyanoacrylate, but these do not meet current scientific requirements.', 'However, the efficacy cannot be assessed precisely, since the study authors had not compared their method to another treatment or sham treatment.', 'How good the method is compared to other methods has not been adequately studied [7].']",1,"The sentences indicate that while there are studies on cyanoacrylate for treating varicose veins, they lack adequate comparisons to other treatments, making it unclear how effective this method is relative to alternatives.","To date, there are no results from clinical studies on this method. The efficacy in comparison with other treatments is therefore unclear."
Is aluminum intake responsible for the development of Alzheimer's disease?,"['Cause unknown As far as the cause of pathological memory loss is concerned, research is still relatively in the dark.', ""However, due to the implementation of the study, it cannot be concluded that small traces of aluminium are actually the triggering cause of Alzheimer's disease.""]",1,"The sentences indicate that while the cause of Alzheimer's disease remains unclear, they do not establish a direct link between aluminum intake and the disease, suggesting that more research is needed to determine any potential connection.","Scientific studies cannot prove with certainty a connection between the metal aluminum and the disease Alzheimer, but they cannot exclude it either."
Can regular exercise prevent or relieve migraine symptoms?,"['In a systematic overview from 2008 [ 2 ] of 7 studies with very low participation numbers, the authors conclude that sporting activity can probably lead to a slight reduction in the pain intensity of further migraine attacks.', 'A randomized-controlled study [ 3 ] in 30 migraine patients found at least a small reduction in the pain intensity of future migraine seizures for a combination program of aerobic training followed by muscle relaxation.', 'In another, less rigorous study [ 4 ] in 16 patients, compared to migraine patients who did not participate in any sports program, there was also a small reduction in pain intensity.', 'In a recent study from 2009 [ 5 ], the scientists found a similar improvement in the frequency of monthly migraine attacks.', 'Too little comprehensive investigations for clear effect In summary, a certain effectiveness of regularly operated endurance sports such as jogging or cycling for prevention of migraine attacks seems likely.']",0,"Regular exercise may lead to a slight reduction in migraine pain intensity and frequency, but the evidence is limited and not definitive.","In some, but not all, studies, regular exercise seems to at least somewhat reduce the pain intensity of future migraine attacks. Whether the frequency of migraine attacks can also be reduced cannot be assessed with certainty. for this, larger, better validated studies would have to be conducted."
Does regular intake of extra virgin olive oil protect against coronary heart disease such as heart attack?,"['Probably related to reduced risk of heart attack Many research groups have already studied the question of whether olive oil can actually reduce the risk of heart attacks and other heart diseases over the last two decades.', 'When eating more than 30 grams of olive oil per day, the risk of heart disease was only about half as high as in people who consumed less than 15 grams per day or no olive oil at all.', 'The olive oil-rich diet resulted in a significant reduction in the risk of heart attack and death for almost five years by just under a third compared to a conventional diet.', 'Study participants with high olive oil consumption were significantly less likely to be found in the group of heart attack patients, the scientists therefore concluded that the oil had a significant protective effect.', 'The results of the two most reliable and largest cohort studies [ 2, 3 ] indicate a likely protective effect of increased consumption of cold-pressed olive oil over several years.']",0,"The provided sentences indicate that regular intake of extra virgin olive oil is associated with a reduced risk of heart attack and coronary heart disease, suggesting a protective effect based on various studies.","Regular consumption of cold-pressed olive oil may possibly prevent coronary heart disease. However, direct evidence is still pending."
Can apigenin reduce cancer risk or prevent cancer progression?,"['On the other hand, a laboratory study [5] found that apigenin might inhibit the effect of chemotherapy treatments.', 'However, when treated with apigenin, the cancer cells became resistant to this drug and did not die.', 'Apigenine without influence on cancer risk What applies in small cases could also apply in large cases.', 'This showed that those participants who had eaten the most apigenine with food were not less likely to have cancer than other women in the study.', 'Unefficacious and possibly risky Apart from laboratory findings, previous observational studies show that the potential protective effect of apigenin is not able to significantly reduce the risk of cancer in normal diets [8].']",2,"The evidence presented indicates that apigenin does not significantly reduce cancer risk, as participants consuming the most apigenin were not less likely to have cancer, and previous studies suggest its protective effect is negligible in normal diets.","Studies suggest that even high levels of apigenin in food do not protect against cancer. In individual cases, it is suspected that apigenin in high amounts could weaken the effect of chemotherapy or even accelerate cancer growth."
Are animal-assisted therapies effective for mental illness?,"['The authors conclude from the data that animal assisted therapies may be effective in some diseases, including mental disorders and behavioural disorders such as depression, schizophrenia and addiction.', 'There is still no reliable data on the efficacy of animal-based therapy, for example in patients with cancer and advanced fatal diseases, in terms of state of health and quality of life.']",0,"The sentences indicate that while animal-assisted therapies may show effectiveness for some mental disorders, there is insufficient reliable data to confirm their overall efficacy, particularly in severe health conditions.","Studies on the effects of animal-assisted therapies are only partially conclusive. It seems plausible that animal-assisted therapies can be supportive for some mental illnesses; however, very large or rapid effects are unlikely."
Do air ions cause an improvement of asthma??,"['Compared to asthma patients who were exposed to dummy treatment, actual therapy with air ionization devices did not show any improvement in asthma symptoms or lung function.']",2,"The provided sentences indicate that air ionization devices did not lead to any improvement in asthma symptoms or lung function compared to a dummy treatment, directly contradicting the claim.","Whether ionized air can reduce allergic symptoms is unclear, as no studies exist on this question. Air ionization devices do not appear to be effective against asthma in general."
Do smoking bans lead to fewer preterm births?,"['Smoking bans mean that mothers smoke less in pregnancy and that unborn women are exposed to less passive smoke.', 'It is a methodically very good work, but there are some limitations to the statements: the results of the individual studies vary greatly, whether the real effect is really 10% each, will only be able to clarify future studies.']",0,"The sentences indicate that smoking bans may reduce smoking during pregnancy and exposure to passive smoke, but the variability in study results suggests that the true impact on preterm births remains uncertain and requires further investigation.","A large review shows a 10% reduced risk of preterm birth. Due to some limitations, the evidence is nevertheless low, further studies from different countries will probably soon bring clarity."
"Does the ""Rolfing"" treatment cause an improvement of body malpositions as well as certain pains?","['Therefore, it cannot be automatically deduced from these results that the cause of the pain reduction lies in the Rolfing treatments.', 'Overall, the scientific evidence on the effectiveness of Rolfing technology for the treatment of pain or correction of body malpositions is insufficient.']",1,The sentences indicate that there is insufficient scientific evidence to conclude that Rolfing treatments effectively reduce pain or correct body malpositions.,"The few studies on ""Rolfing"" are too inconclusive to answer the question."
Are movement exercises useful for back pain?,"['Targeted exercise to strengthen torso muscles should both relieve and prevent back pain.', 'As a systematic overview [1] shows, strengthening exercises can clearly prevent the recurrence of pain.', 'One of the results: Chronic cross pain (duration over twelve weeks) improves at least something when the sufferers perform regular exercise.']",0,"Targeted exercises aimed at strengthening torso muscles are shown to relieve and prevent back pain, and regular exercise can improve chronic back pain conditions.","Exercise reduces the risk of getting back pain again and can relieve chronic back pain somewhat. However, quick relief from acute pain is not to be expected."
Does tocilizumab specifically help children with rheumatoid arthritis (juvenile idiopathic arthritis) ?,"[""Although the data from the two children's studies are not as reliable as those from the larger and more numerous studies in adults, tocilizumab may be more effective in children with systemic JIA than in adults with rheumatic arthritis.""]",0,"Tocilizumab may be more effective in children with systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis than in adults with rheumatic arthritis, suggesting a potential benefit for this specific population.","In contrast to adult rheumatoid arthritis patients, where the efficacy of tocilizumab has been well studied, there are only 2 controlled studies for use in children on a specific subtype (systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis) with very few participants. These suggest better efficacy than in adults, but in reality this is likely to be lower than presented in the study results. In addition, the drug can also cause severe side effects."
Does taking antibiotics for acute sinusitis speed up the healing of the infection?,"['They say that antibiotics can shorten acute sinus inflammation a little – but only in a few people.', 'Sickness duration: only 5 out of 100 benefit What is the benefit of taking an antibiotic on the cure, i.e.', 'This means that only 5 out of 100 people with acute rhinosinusitis benefit from taking an antibiotic instead of a dummy medication.']",0,"The sentences indicate that only a small percentage of individuals with acute rhinosinusitis experience any benefit from antibiotics, suggesting that they do not significantly speed up healing for most people.","Taking antibiotics can somewhat speed up the healing of an acute sinus infection. However, the success rate is not exhilarating: antibiotics lead to a faster recovery in only 5 out of 100 people. Pain and impairment in everyday life are not improved. And, of course, antibiotics can cause side effects. All in all, antibiotics often don't have much benefit in acute sinusitis."
"Is short, high-intensity training equally effective as longer, moderate-intensity training?",['Whether the fitness level remains comparable over a long period of time had not been investigated in any of the studies.'],0,"The provided sentences indicate that the long-term effects of short, high-intensity training compared to longer, moderate-intensity training have not been studied, leaving the claim unaddressed.","Yes, possibly. However, there are only a few studies on this, some of which are inadequate. Possible side effects have not been studied."
Does mesotherapy help against pain?,"['Herbs and turnips In mesotherapy, many small stitches are used to administer a drug to the skin in the immediate vicinity of the affected region – with each single stitch a small dose is inserted into a specific skin depth.', 'Many stitches, few studies As extensive as the approaches are, the study situation is limited, for almost all forms of mesotherapy lacks evidence of effectiveness, for the treatment of pain there are at all few studies to be found.', 'A study from 2010 [1] confirms that mesotherapy has the same effectiveness as standard therapy – the use of corticosteroids and other pain and inflammation inhibitors in the form of tablets and syringes.']",2,"The effectiveness of mesotherapy for pain relief is unclear, as there are few studies available, and while one study suggests it may have similar effectiveness to standard therapies, the overall evidence remains limited.","Mesotherapy is an umbrella term for very different treatments that have only the method of administration in common, namely the injection of many small doses of an agent into a specific skin layer. Therefore, it is not possible to make a general statement about its effectiveness. Some studies indicate that it can be a useful way of administering established medications for certain complaints."
Can negative expectancy reduce the effect of pain medications?,"['Benefits and damage from nothing In randomized controlled studies, the nocebo effect can be observed well.']",2,"The sentences indicate that the nocebo effect, which involves negative expectations leading to adverse outcomes, can be observed in studies, suggesting that negative expectancy may indeed influence the effectiveness of pain medications.","Studies clearly show that ineffective placebo can bring severe side effects, depending on the patient's expectations. One effect can also be that the effectiveness of painkillers is limited."
Does the drug fingolimod reduce the progression of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis similarly or better than previous drugs?,"['The recently newly approved active substance Fingolimod in Europe causes white blood cells (T cells) to be held back in the lymph nodes, which prevents them from causing inflammation by immigrating to the brain.', 'By means of systematic literature research, we wanted to find out whether fingolimod is similar to or better than previous multiple sclerosis – drugs can inhibit the progression of the disease.']",0,"The sentences indicate that fingolimod's mechanism involves preventing T cells from causing inflammation, and the research aims to compare its efficacy in inhibiting disease progression against previous multiple sclerosis drugs, but they do not provide conclusive evidence regarding its effectiveness relative to those drugs.","Two manufacturer-funded clinical trials attest Fingolimod such efficacy that exceeds that of interferon beta therapy. However, the drug can also cause serious side effects."
Do saw palmetto preparations help with benign prostate enlargement?,"['[4] [7] A well substantiated statement can only be made for saw palm preparations: A data analysis published in 2012 shows that these remedies do not work better than placebos and are therefore ineffective.', 'However, it might be useful to continue to follow certain indications of symptom-improving plants and to compare them with new studies – at least in older studies, extracts of the African plum tree, willow grass pollen and the plant ingredient beta-sitosterin were considered safe and possibly effective.', '[updated and supplemented on March 1, 2015 with details on saw palm extracts, beta sitosterol, extracts of the African plum tree and willow grass pollen extract] ( Author: J.

However, current evidence for reliable and long-term efficacy is generally lacking, and most remedies are not well studied. It is therefore not possible to lump all products together. Preparations containing the plant ingredient beta-sitosterol, extracts of the African plum tree or ryegrass pollen extract could possibly lead to some improvement - however, this cautious assumption is based on outdated data. However, the current finding is this: remedies containing saw palmetto do not work any better than placebo and are thus considered ineffective."
Does not wearing bras provide medical benefits?,"['Our conclusion Scientific evidence on health advantages or disadvantages of bras is missing.', 'Also the studies, on the basis of which it is recommended to wear a well-seated bra in a painful breasts, are not meaningful: In a work already over 40 years old 114 women with a painful breast got to wear a well-suited bra, for which they could choose from 144 different sizes [2].', 'Thus, it remains unclear whether, for example, there would have been an improvement even without bra treatment.', 'In the bra group, all women initially complained of a lack of comfort, but later 85 percent of patients reported an improvement in chest discomfort.']",1,"The provided sentences indicate a lack of scientific evidence regarding the health advantages or disadvantages of bras, leaving the claim about medical benefits unsubstantiated.","Whether it is healthier or even beneficial not to wear a bra cannot be answered due to a lack of studies. Conversely, a few studies claim that well-fitting bras could prevent breast pain. However, the studies are methodologically weak and have virtually no validity."
"Can oral vein products containing herbal active ingredients such as rutosides, hidrosmin, diosmin, extracts of horse chestnut seed and pine bark, Centella asiatica or grape seed extract or the synthetic substances calcium dobesilate or aminaftone relieve symptoms such as itching, restless or swollen legs, pain and cramps in people suffering from varicose veins or chronic venous insufficiency?","['But unfortunately, there is currently no sound scientific evidence that the externally applicable means could alleviate venous ailments [1].', 'Despite the positive trend that emerges in the corresponding studies, it is currently completely unclear whether the venous agents can affect the progression of chronic venous weakness.', 'Whether varicose veins-contaminated legs help a therapy with cyanoacrylate – a kind of superglue intended to seal the affected vein – is currently unclear, as Medizin-transparent.at has already illuminated in its own article.', 'After most studies focused on symptoms such as itching or tension in the legs, we cannot assess whether the venous products for swallowing could slow the progression of chronic vein weakness.']",0,The provided sentences indicate a lack of sound scientific evidence regarding the effectiveness of oral vein products containing herbal active ingredients or synthetic substances in alleviating symptoms associated with varicose veins or chronic venous insufficiency.,"At present, it is not possible to assess the efficacy of ointments, gels or creams because studies on these products are lacking. The situation is different for vein remedies to be swallowed. Studies suggest that some may improve symptoms of varicose veins or chronic venous insufficiency, such as itching, restless or swollen legs, pain and cramps. Quite likely, the remedies are likely to help with water retention in the legs (edema) caused by venous disease.
