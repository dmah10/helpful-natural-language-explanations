Can masks reduce corona infections when worn by a large proportion of the population?,"['Studies show slow spread After three years of pandemic, there are now relatively meaningful data that masks can slow down the spread of the Corona virus.', 'Surgical masks, in turn, seem to reduce the risk of infecting themselves with the corona virus.']",0,"The first sentence supports the claim by indicating that studies show masks can slow down the spread of the Corona virus, while the second sentence provides additional evidence that surgical masks specifically can reduce the risk of self-infection.","International studies suggest that the number of corona infections decreases when many people wear masks - whether fabric, surgical or FFP2 masks. However, it is not possible to precisely quantify how great the protective effect actually is. It probably depends on the type of masks and the proportion of people who wear them."
Can homeopathic preparations with Anamirta cocculus help against dizziness?,"['But without success: We could not find any meaningful scientific evidence for effectiveness in dizziness.', 'It is now well proven by studies that homeopathic preparations usually do not work better than a sham medication (placebo) [8].', 'However, it is not well established that betahistine is effective against dizziness [11.13].', 'The fact that betahist helps with dizziness is not well documented [11, 13].']",1,"While there is no strong scientific evidence supporting the use of homeopathic preparations with Anamirta cocculus for dizziness, the effectiveness of betahistine, a conventional treatment, is also not well documented according to the provided sentences.","We have found only one study that has investigated this. However, it is so poor that no reliable statement is possible."
Can zeolite alleviate or prevent health problems?,"['However, none of these can provide any evidence – because the studies have no significance (for reasons see section Studies in detail ).', 'It does not find an advantage for zeolite – but the results are hardly meaningful.', 'However, it is not researched whether the regular intake of zeolite can lead to a nutrient deficiency or has an undesirable effect on digestion.']",1,"The claim that zeolite can alleviate or prevent health problems is not supported by the provided sentences, which indicate a lack of significant studies and unclear effects on nutrition and digestion.",Studies to date cannot provide any evidence that taking zeolite prevents or alleviates complaints. A detoxifying effect is not scientifically plausible.
Does paxlovid protect unvaccinated people with risk factors from severe or even fatal covid 19 disease?,"['Patients at risk without corona vaccination appear to be well protected from serious to fatal events by Paxlovid.', 'However, it is not certain how well Paxlovid helps people who have already received corona vaccination.', 'In addition, the scientists investigated whether Paxlovid alleviated the Covid-19 symptoms, shortened the duration of the disease and reduced the need for medical treatment: Half of the participants improved the symptoms with Paxlovid after 13 days, with placebo after 15 days.', 'With Paxlovid, 14 out of 1000 participants needed medical treatment for Covid-19 within a month, with placebo 76 out of 1000.', 'Whether with or without antibodies in the blood, Paxlovid basically protected all humans from a severe course.']",0,"The claim is supported by the sentences, as they indicate that Paxlovid provides protection from serious to fatal Covid-19 for unvaccinated individuals with risk factors, regardless of antibody presence.","In a large, well-done study, paxlovid prevented hospitalizations and deaths in high-risk patients. They were unvaccinated and had contracted the delta variant. For vaccinated people, the benefit cannot be reliably estimated. This also applies to people with immunodeficiency."
"Does starting school later improve health, learning success, and quality of life in adolescents?","['However, teenagers and parents now have to be very strong: despite 27 studies involving hundreds of thousands of students, no clear results can be derived from research.', 'The problem: The studies usually come to contradictory results.', 'So until better research results are available, all troubled young people and parents will only have the option of remaining out of bed early – or to hope that, despite lack of evidence, the school management will still have an insight into it.', 'It is difficult to examine whether a later start to school will have a positive effect.', 'The Problems: Unknown Influencing Factors: If differences occur in previous-after-studies, these do not have to be due to the later start of school – they may also have been caused by other changes over the course of the study period.']",1,"The claim cannot be definitively supported or refuted due to contradictory results from hundreds of thousands of students across 27 studies, and the presence of unknown influencing factors that could affect the outcomes.","The question has been investigated in several large studies. Due to methodological deficiencies and contradictory results, no firm conclusions can be drawn. This means that science can currently neither speak for nor against a benefit of a later school start."
Does the F.X. Mayr cure have health benefits? Can it prevent diseases or treat them?,"['Thus, the claim that the method can help with various diseases is not scientifically justified.', 'These studies cannot answer whether these changes also affect health.', 'Mayr cure or other fasting methods improve health in the long term, however, cannot be concluded.']",1,"The claim that the F.X. Mayr cure has health benefits or can prevent or treat diseases is not supported, as scientific justification is lacking and long-term health improvements from fasting methods like the Mayr cure are not conclusive.","It is neither examined nor proven whether the special fasting method after F.X. Mayr holds, which it promises: Namely assistance with all possible illnesses of allergies, over rheumatism up to sleep disturbances. The advertised detoxification and ""purification"" of the body by the chamfering cure are besides scientifically not plausible."
Does the consumption of soy foods or soy isoflavones affect the appearance of acne skin?,"['In both cases, certain soya ingredients are responsible for the effect on the skin: the isoflavones.', 'There are two competing theories that contradict each other: according to the first theory, isoflavones confuse the hormone balance and are supposed to promote acne in this way.', 'Surprisingly, despite searching in two large databases, we could not find a study on soy products and acne – whether soy milk, soy sauce or tofu.', 'The isoflavones improved the skin appearance more than an anti-acne cream with vitamin A acid (Tretinoin).', 'Conclusion: There is currently no evidence from reliable studies that soy makes acne worse.']",1,"While some studies suggest isoflavones in soy may impact skin appearance, there is currently no concrete evidence from reliable studies that soy exacerbates acne, as claimed.","We could not find any meaningful studies at all on the influence of soy foods on acne. On soy isoflavones, we found two small studies of questionable quality that examined a very specific group of sufferers. Soy isoflavones improved the skin appearance somewhat. However, this result is not reliable."
Does extract from the Damiana plant (Turnera diffusa) help with erectile dysfunction?,"['Efficacy does not appear to have been studied or demonstrated.', 'The studies in detail We could not find any studies on Damiana extract against erectile dysfunction in men.', 'Studies on the product Neradin also appear to be missing.']",1,"The claim that Damiana plant extract helps with erectile dysfunction is not supported by any studies, as mentioned in the sentences provided.","The extract from the Damiana plant (Turnera diffusa) is advertised as a remedy for erectile dysfunction for men. However, this claimed effect on potency is by no means proven. It has apparently never been tested on humans. This also applies to homeopathic remedies such as the product Neradin."
Is the homeopathic remedy Neradin effective for erectile dysfunction?,"['No studies on Neradin Also our search for studies on the product Neradin remained resultless.', 'Studies on the product Neradin also appear to be missing.']",1,"The claim that Neradin is effective for erectile dysfunction is not supported by the provided sentences, as there is a lack of studies or evidence found regarding the product's effectiveness.","The extract from the Damiana plant (Turnera diffusa) is advertised as a remedy for erectile dysfunction for men. However, this claimed effect on potency is by no means proven. It has apparently never been tested on humans. This also applies to homeopathic remedies such as the product Neradin."
Does regular HPV testing in addition to the recommended Pap smear detect more precancerous lesions than just the Pap smear alone?,"['According to the studies, the HPV test is likely to detect slightly more precursors of cervical cancer over several years than the PAP swab alone.', 'We are therefore relatively sure that with an additional HPV test at least a little more precursors of uterine cancer are detected than only with the PAP swab alone.']",0,"The studies suggest that HPV testing detects slightly more precancerous lesions than the Pap smear alone over several years, supporting the claim.","Regular examination of the cervix by means of PAP smear tests detects precancerous stages of the cervix in most cases in good time. This reduces the risk of developing cervical cancer. An additional HPV test every three to five years can make screening even more reliable. However, the difference should not be too great."
Can olive leaf extract reduce high blood pressure?,"['These studies therefore do not indicate whether olive leaf extract can help with significantly increased blood pressure.', 'Without success, however, we could not find any studies that investigated the effect of olive leaf extract on cardiovascular health.', 'However, they cannot provide clear answers.', 'It is therefore impossible to say whether olive leaves extract could have a better or worse effect with significantly increased blood pressure.']",1,"The claim cannot be supported or refuted as there is no substantial evidence indicating olive leaf extract's effect on significantly increased blood pressure, according to the provided sentences.","Whether olive leaf extract lowers blood pressure has been investigated in five suitable studies to date. They all found no effect or only a slight effect of the extract. The problem with this is that most of the study participants had only slightly elevated blood pressure. They cannot answer how olive leaf extract works in people with significantly elevated blood pressure (hypertension). The studies also had gross flaws, few participants, and ran for a very short time. They cannot provide reliable answers."
Do green-lipped mussel preparations improve the symptoms of osteoarthritis?,"['Studies overall not meaningful The conclusion of our research: Scientific evidence for the claimed effect is missing.', 'It is also unclear whether the measured positive effects are large enough to actually be felt by those affected.', 'Whether or not green-lipped mussel helps with osteoarthritis cannot be said at the moment.', 'However, as early as 2009, the European Food Safety Authority considered that a protective effect of the green-lipped mussel on healthy joints has not been established.', 'In our opinion, no reliable conclusions can be drawn from the studies found.']",1,"The claim that green-lipped mussel preparations improve osteoarthritis symptoms lacks scientific support and has unclear, insignificant effects based on the research findings.","The question was examined in four small studies with serious methodological deficiencies, which also arrived at partly contradictory results. No clear conclusions can be drawn from them. The claim that green-lipped mussel helps with osteoarthritis is not scientifically proven."
Can probiotics lower blood sugar in type 2 diabetes?,"['And if so, can probiotics reverse this change and reduce blood sugar levels again?', 'At the most small effect, they may actually be able to.', 'However, the effect of the capsules and tablets does not seem to be large: in the previous studies, they were able to reduce the long-term sugar level HbA1c by an average of 0.55 points.']",0,"While probiotics in capsule or tablet form may have a small effect in reducing HbA1c levels by an average of 0.55 points in type 2 diabetes, as suggested in the studies, it is unclear if they can reverse the change and reduce blood sugar levels to a significant extent.","The summarized results of studies to date suggest that probiotics in capsule or tablet form could lower blood sugar somewhat. At least if they are taken over a period of two to three months. However, the effect is not well established. Probiotic dairy products and probiotic powder for dissolving do not seem to have any demonstrable effect."
Can the so-called Tupler technique help against rectus diastasis?,"['No studies on the Tupler technique As intense as we were looking for, we could not find the promised studies on the Tupler technique.', 'The claim that this is a scientifically proven therapy for rectus diastase is therefore simply wrong.', 'The studies in detail We did not find any studies that investigated the effectiveness of the Tupler technique for the treatment of rectus diastase.']",1,"While the Tupler technique is often suggested for rectus diastasis, there is no scientific evidence supporting its effectiveness as claimed, as detailed searches for studies on its success yielded no results.",We could not find a single study that examined whether the Tupler technique actually works. And this despite the fact that providers of the method advertise that its effectiveness is scientifically proven.
Can laser irradiation of blood by infusion needle (hemolaser treatment) relieve discomfort or help with diseases?,"['It is also unclear by what mechanism blood irradiation with bundled red light – i.e.', 'red laser – should improve health.', 'Although the authors of the three studies found [1-3] claim to have established a clear efficacy of haemolaser treatment, none of the three studies is suitable to prove this.']",1,"The claim that laser irradiation of blood through an infusion needle can alleviate discomfort or aid in diseases is not supported by the provided sentences, as the mechanism by which this improves health is unclear, and the studies cited do not provide sufficient evidence to establish efficacy.",There is no scientific evidence that hemolaser treatment has a palliative or curative effect on health problems.
"In everyday life, when breathing with an FFP2 mask or ordinary mouth-nose protection, do you get as much oxygen as without a mask?","['As much oxygen as without a mask This fear is, however, unfounded, as previously conducted studies show [ 1,2 ].', 'Only in very strenuous sports (fast cycling to exhaustion) was the oxygen content in the blood with FFP2 mask slightly lower than without mask.', 'There was no difference in oxygen measurement with ordinary oral nose protection.', 'Breathing a little more strenuous The results thus contradict the rumor that masks would cause an oxygen deficiency.']",0,"The claim is supported by the sentences, as previous studies indicate that there is no significant difference in oxygen intake when wearing an FFP2 mask or ordinary mouth-nose protection, except for very strenuous sports, which does not apply to everyday life.","Even if breathing with a mask can feel uncomfortable: According to studies to date, you get just as much oxygen with an FFP2 mask or mouth-nose protection as without a mask. This is true even when you are moving or exerting yourself. Only very intensive sports slightly reduce the oxygen content in the blood - but too little to endanger health."
Can CBD help with period pain?,"['Because despite searching in three different databases we could not find a single study on CBD in case of regular pain.', 'Scientifically, it is not sufficiently researched whether CBD actually promotes sleep, as providers claim.', 'The studies in detail We could not find any studies that investigated whether CBD can help with normal pain – neither for treatment nor for prevention.']",1,"The claim that CBD can help with period pain is not supported by the provided sentences, as there is no scientific evidence found in three different databases regarding CBD's effectiveness for regular pain, including menstrual pain.",Whether CBD can relieve menstrual pain has apparently never been scientifically studied. We could not find any studies on this. Women who suffer from severe period pain should talk to a gynecologist about it. Diseases such as endometriosis could be behind it.
"Can a bioresonance device like ""Bioscan"" or ""Vieva Vital Analyser"" measure mineral and vitamin deficiencies or detect health problems?","['This experiment clearly shows that the devices studied are completely unsuitable to diagnose a lack of vitamins or minerals.', 'Sentenced for fraud at the end of May 2022, a German court also concluded that the Bioscan device cannot fulfil the claimed claims.', 'Claims for comparable products are equally implausible.', 'Even if 1000 subjects had participated in the study and only five to six people had shown such unreliable readings, such a device would be worthless for diagnostics.']",2,"The Bioscan device and similar products cannot measure mineral and vitamin deficiencies or detect health problems, as concluded by a German court and supported by an experiment showing their unreliability.","An experiment shows that the devices cannot distinguish between healthy people, seriously ill people and a corpse. The claimed mode of action behind the measurement method is also scientifically implausible. A German court has convicted the manufacturers of the Bioscan device (not legally binding) of fraud."
Does arthroscopy (joint endoscopy) help with osteoarthritis of the knee joint?,"['What might sound logical, however, has a catch: the arthroscopy of osteoarthritis does nothing to the treated person.', 'Studies clearly speak against a benefit A research team summarized the most meaningful of all previously published studies on arthroscopy in knee arthritis.', 'In these studies, patients treated after arthroscopy had no noticeably less pain or movement restrictions than those treated only for appearance or not at all.', 'Arthroscopy against osteoarthritis: not effective, but also not very risky After all: Undesirable events were not conspicuously common in the arthroscopy groups either.']",2,The claim that arthroscopy helps with osteoarthritis of the knee joint is refuted by the sentences stating that studies show no benefit in pain or movement restrictions for patients treated with arthroscopy compared to those not treated or treated only for appearance.,The data are clear: Arthroscopy is useless as a treatment for knee osteoarthritis. It can neither relieve pain nor improve the function of the knee joint in the long term.
"Do dietary supplements containing silicon (e.g. as ""organic silicon"" or silica) have health benefits?","['So far it is also completely unclear what role the element silicon plays in the human body at all [8].', 'We have researched: Previous studies do not provide any evidence that dietary supplements with silicon support bone build-up and thus protect older women from osteoporosis and bone fractures in old age [1,2].', 'There is no evidence that silicon improves the hair structure [3,4], strengthens the fingernails [4] or makes the skin more beautiful and elastic [4,6,7].', 'Also that silicon supports the formation of collagen and connective tissue is only a conjecture [8].', 'Conjectures without studies Neither we nor the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) [8] were able to find clinical studies on any other alleged health benefits of silicon.']",1,"While there is no concrete evidence in previous studies indicating that dietary supplements containing silicon support bone build-up, improve hair structure, strengthen fingernails, or enhance skin beauty and elasticity, the exact role of silicon in the human body remains unclear [1,2,3,4,6,7,8].","There is no evidence so far that the additional intake of silicon can promote health. Also that it strengthens nails, skin and hair is an unsubstantiated claim. Moreover, it is unclear whether silicon plays any role at all in the body."
Can regular intake of cranberry juice or cranberry extract prevent recurrent cystitis in women?,"['The summarized results show that the regular intake of cranberry products could have a preventive effect.', 'There is also only evidence that cranberry products can prevent bladder inflammation for otherwise healthy women.', 'Overall, there is evidence of a possible preventive effect of cranberry.']",0,"The claim is partially supported by the sentences, as they suggest a preventive effect of cranberry products for bladder inflammation in generally healthy women, but they do not explicitly mention recurrent cystitis in women.","Women who repeatedly have to deal with bladder infections might become ill somewhat less frequently if they regularly take cranberry juice or extract. However, this is not well established. And it only applies to uncomplicated bladder infections in otherwise healthy women. Whether cranberry products help when cystitis is already present remains unclear. This has not yet been investigated in meaningful studies."
Will women who have recurrent bladder infections get rid of them faster if they take cranberry products only after the disease is already there???,"['There is also only evidence that cranberry products can prevent bladder inflammation for otherwise healthy women.', 'However, there does not seem to be any meaningful studies that have investigated this in women with recurrent bladder inflammation.', 'The preventive effect of cranberry in children, men and people with urinary catheters or certain diseases has not been studied.']",1,"While cranberry products have been shown to prevent bladder inflammation in healthy women, there is a lack of studies investigating their impact on women with recurrent bladder infections, making it unclear if they can help eliminate infections once they have already occurred.","Women who repeatedly have to deal with bladder infections might become ill somewhat less frequently if they regularly take cranberry juice or extract. However, this is not well established. And it only applies to uncomplicated bladder infections in otherwise healthy women.

Can extract from St. John's wort relieve the symptoms of depression? Is it similarly effective as drugs against depression (antidepressants)?,"[""St John's wort: effective in mild to moderate depression Probably yes."", ""In mild to moderate depression, St John's wort preparations probably work better than placebo."", ""St John's wort preparations are probably as good as antidepressants."", ""St. John's wort and antidepressants can relieve the discomfort, but the depression can probably not cure for good.""]",0,"The claim is supported by the sentences, as St. John's wort is suggested to be effective in mild to moderate depression, working better than placebo, and being as good as antidepressants, although it may not cure depression permanently.",St. John's wort is likely to relieve the symptoms of mild to moderate depression better than a placebo. It also appears to be similarly effective to approved medications for depression (antidepressants). St. John's wort preparations are generally better tolerated than antidepressants.
"Does the Zisano bracelet strengthen the immune system, increase endurance and performance or reduce fatigue?","['Whether such bracelets have an effect, for example whether they can actually increase physical performance or strengthen the immune system, has apparently never been investigated.', 'Bracelets for more performance: studies show ineffectiveness All five studies came to the same conclusion: the bracelets had no effect on the performance or well-being of the subjects.', 'A scientifically plausible explanation as to how exactly such bracelets should develop their effect remains to be found in their suppliers.', 'The studies in detail We could not find any studies on the Zisano bracelet or comparable bracelets with silicon chip.']",1,"The claim that the Zisano bracelet strengthens the immune system, increases endurance and performance, or reduces fatigue is not supported by the provided sentences, which mention a lack of scientific studies on the Zisano bracelet or similar products, and note that five studies found no effect of such bracelets on performance or well-being.","The promised positive effects of the ""Powerband"" wristband on health and well-being have apparently not been scientifically studied. We could not find any studies on this. It is also unclear how the wristband is supposed to work in concrete terms. A scientifically plausible explanation is missing."
"Does microimmunotherapy improve symptoms of allergies, cancer, joint inflammation, autoimmune diseases, dementia or various viral infections?","['None of these studies are meaningful – because they are poorly carried out and the published data are incomplete.', 'They cannot give any indication of the benefits of microimmune therapy.', 'Entitled doubts Since microimmune therapy preparations are highly diluted as homeopathic agents, we have fundamental doubts about the method.']",1,"The sentences express skepticism about microimmunotherapy's efficacy, citing study quality issues and the homeopathic nature of the preparations, which does not support the claim of improvement in various medical conditions.","So far, studies seem to exist only on microimmunotherapy against hay fever and cancer. Their significance is far too low to conclude that the therapy is effective. We found no studies on other health problems. Thus, there is no proven benefit of microimmunotherapy for any disease."
Does pine wood improve sleep?,"['So there is no indication that the pine wood improves sleep.', 'The importance of these laboratory measurements for the sleep of the participants is unclear – even if the researchers interpret them as positive effects of the circling bed.', 'Whether a pine bed actually improves sleep would have to study more rigorous studies carried out according to scientific criteria on significantly more subjects in the future.The studies in detail [1,2] Grote et al.']",1,"While two studies are mentioned [1,2], the first sentence directly refutes the claim that pine wood improves sleep, stating there is no indication of such an effect.","So far, only one small study has investigated this question. However, the results of this study are not conclusive due to numerous deficiencies in the conduct of the study."
Do spermidine supplements or a spermidine-rich diet reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia? Do they help with existing dementia?,"['Spermidin studies: not enough as evidence of efficacy Even if both studies had come to overwhelmingly positive results, we would still have concerns about their significance.', 'Spermidine, which is additionally absorbed by food, is not sufficiently researched at the present time.', 'The number of participants is low and the risk is high that the results are not transferable to reality.', 'We do not consider the study to be meaningful.', 'Results: Both the spermidine group and the comparator group had fewer dementia symptoms and better mental performance at the end of the study.']",1,"The claim is not sufficiently supported by the provided sentences, as the studies on spermidine's effects on dementia symptoms have low participant numbers, increasing the risk that the results may not be transferable to reality, and spermidine's efficacy is not yet thoroughly researched.","Manufacturers of spermidine drugs advertise an alleged positive effect on mental performance and protection against dementia. However, such an effect has not been proven in meaningful studies. We found a single study in which dementia patients had participated. However, their results are not very clear."
Does covid vaccination reduce the likelihood of getting long-lasting symptoms (long covid) in case of corona infection?,"['Long-Covid risk with low vaccination Two studies [1,2] suggest that the long-covid risk is likely to be lower if vaccinated twice: In one of these studies with Corona infected [1], twice vaccinated patients reported 40 to 50 percent less likely to be affected by Long Covid compared to non-vaccinated patients.', 'Results Two-fold Vaccinated people reported to be affected by long-covid symptoms only about half as often as non-vaccinated people.']",0,"The sentences provide evidence that twice-vaccinated individuals are 40 to 50 percent less likely, or approximately half as likely, to experience long-lasting COVID-19 symptoms compared to non-vaccinated individuals, supporting the claim.","If twice-vaccinated people are infected, their risk of later being affected by Long Covid may be only half that of non-vaccinated people.

Do sedatives and sleeping pills such as benzodiazepines and related substances increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease or other forms of dementia?,"['However, it cannot be clearly dispelled by the fact that benzodiazepines and similar substances could promote the development of dementia.']",1,"The sentence suggests a potential link between benzodiazepines and dementia, aligning with the claim but not providing sufficient evidence to strongly support or refute it.","A link between the long-term use of sedatives and sleeping pills and the development of dementia cannot be ruled out. However, whether the drugs are the cause of dementia is unclear. Likewise, it is possible that studies show a connection only because people in the undiagnosed early stages of dementia suffer more frequently from sleep disorders or restlessness and therefore take medication against them more often."
Do infusions of vitamin C relieve symptoms of chronic fatigue or long covid?,"['It is also unclear whether people with Long Covid benefit from vitamin C infusions.', 'One of the two authors is also an employee of a pharmaceutical company that also offers products with vitamin C.  Since the developmental mechanisms of both chronic fatigue syndrome and long covid are unclear, studies with cancer patients or healthy participants cannot provide answers to the question whether vitamin C can help people with chronic fatigue syndrome or long covid.']",1,"The claim remains unclear since there is no direct evidence provided about the benefits of vitamin C infusions for people with chronic fatigue or long covid, and one author's affiliation with a pharmaceutical company offering vitamin C products could introduce bias.",Whether vitamin C infusions help with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is questionable. This has not yet been scientifically investigated. We also could not find a single study on vitamin C and fatigue occurring in the context of Long Covid.
Does taking probiotics shorten the duration of acute infectious diarrhea?,"['Thus, at least in children, taking live probiotics is unlikely to affect whether they are still ill after 48 hours.', 'Thus, a probiotic apparently has no clear influence on the resolution of the disease.']",2,"The sentences suggest that probiotics do not have a clear influence on resolving acute infectious diarrhea in children within 48 hours, which contradicts the claim of probiotics potentially shortening the duration of the disease.","According to current studies, the duration of disease cannot be reduced by taking probiotics. This assessment is reasonably well supported."
Does high-dose vitamin D slow down the course of disease in multiple sclerosis (MS)?,"['However, such observations alone are not sufficient to actually demonstrate the benefit of highly dosed vitamin D in MS.   Studies on vitamin D in MS We have therefore been looking for meaningful studies on the high-dose treatment of vitamin D in multiple sclerosis.', 'At present, we cannot say for sure whether highly dosed vitamin D actually brings benefits to MS.', 'However, the data so far suggest that an effect, if any, would be rather small.']",1,"The claim that high-dose vitamin D slows down the course of disease in MS is not definitively supported by the provided sentences, which suggest there is currently insufficient evidence to confirm a significant benefit.","We can neither clearly exclude nor confirm that there is an effect. In a total of 15 studies, no benefit could be demonstrated for high-dose vitamin D in adults with multiple sclerosis. Because the studies had many weaknesses, we cannot draw any conclusions about positive or negative effects."
Does taking taiga root extract strengthen the immune system? Can it make vaccinations more effective or tolerable?,"['Taiga Root and Immune Defense: Extensive Studies Missing In our extensive research, we have not found any studies that can demonstrate an immune-strengthening effect of the Taiga Root.', 'However, the studies were too small and inadequate for reliable results.', 'Whether the taiga root is beneficial to the immune defense can not be proven at the present time – but also cannot be ruled out.', 'The two available studies also do not provide any information on whether taiga root extract could even make vaccinations more effective.']",1,"While there is no concrete evidence from the studies found to support an immune-strengthening effect of taiga root, its potential benefit also cannot be ruled out, and no information is available regarding its impact on vaccination effectiveness.",The alleged immune-strengthening effect of taiga root (also called Siberian ginseng) has apparently never been investigated in appropriate studies. The positive effect claimed by dietary supplement manufacturers after vaccinations is also not proven.
Does short-term fasting improve quality of life in cancer?,"['On this basis, we cannot reliably say whether fasting during chemotherapy is actually useful or not, thus reducing side effects and improving the quality of life.', 'In terms of quality of life, there are already contradictions within the individual studies: in the study [1b], in which the participants switched between fasting and non-fasting after half of the chemotherapy, only in one group did the quality of life improve during fasting, in the other the quality of life did not improve.', 'Whether this is actually noticeable for cancer patients remains questionable.']",1,"The claim that short-term fasting improves quality of life in cancer is not reliably supported, as individual studies show contradictions and the overall impact on cancer patients' quality of life remains questionable.",We found only three very small studies on both questions. Their results are so unreliable that we cannot make any assessment. So we cannot say whether the quality of life of those affected is improved and whether fasting during chemotherapy reduces side effects.
Does zinc preventively protect against covid-19 disease???,"['A preventive effect has not yet been researched in a single study.', 'It is therefore unclear whether the preventive use of zinc preparations protects against an infection with SARS-CoV-2 or a Covid-19 disease.']",1,"The claim that zinc prevents Covid-19 disease is not supported by the provided sentences, as no research has been conducted to establish a preventive effect and it remains unclear if zinc protects against SARS-CoV-2 infection or Covid-19 disease.",The results of two studies on this suggest that sufferers with Covid-19 do not recover more quickly with zinc than without. A preventive effect has not yet been investigated in studies.
Do herbal remedies with nasturtium and horseradish alleviate the symptoms of cystitis as well as an antibiotic???,"['The antibiotic alleviated the discomfort faster than the product with capuchin cress and horseradish, after eight days there was no difference.', 'Therefore, the herbal agent is not likely to be a full substitute for an antibiotic.']",1,"While the antibiotic provided faster relief initially, after eight days there was no difference in symptoms between it and the herbal remedy with nasturtium and horseradish, suggesting that the herbal agent may not be as effective at alleviating discomfort as an antibiotic, but it might help manage symptoms over a longer period.","As for prevention, we have found only one small but somewhat reliable study. According to this, nasturtium-horseradish remedies probably cannot prevent cystitis. For the treatment of cystitis, we were also only able to evaluate one study. However, it leaves too many questions unanswered to be able to clearly assess its effectiveness."
Does mistletoe therapy help against cancer or can it improve the quality of life of cancer patients?,"['It is currently unclear whether cancer sufferers live longer or better due to mistletoe therapy.', 'No longer survival time detectable The analysis of the previously published survival studies [1] shows that overall mistletoe therapy does not seem to be able to prolong the lifetime of cancer patients.', 'In order to prove this, meaningful studies are still missing – even after about a hundred years.The studies in detail We looked for overviews in three different databases, which summarize the current study situation on mistletoe therapy in cancer.']",1,"The claim that mistletoe therapy helps against cancer or improves the quality of life for cancer patients is not supported, as current studies do not show a prolonged survival time for these patients.","Mistletoe therapy for cancer has been investigated in some studies. However, these are very poor and come to inconsistent results. They cannot prove that mistletoe therapy is effective. In addition, there is a suspicion that mistletoe preparations may even stimulate tumor growth in some types of cancer."
Can homeopathic remedies prevent colds in children?,"['Benefits for prevention improbable The conclusion of the review work: Homeopathy is probably not an effective means of preventing colds in children.', 'Children who regularly took homeopathic medicines were not less likely to become ill in the meaningful studies and their colds were not milder.', 'Overall, the studies could not find a preventive effect of homeopathic medicines; they did not reduce the frequency or severity of cold diseases.']",2,"The claim that homeopathic remedies can prevent colds in children is refuted by the sentences stating that children who regularly took homeopathic medicines were not less likely to become ill, and overall studies found no preventive effect of homeopathic medicines in reducing the frequency or severity of cold diseases.","Well-conducted studies find neither a preventive nor an alleviating effect of homeopathy on children's colds (chills). However, these studies have examined too few children for a truly conclusive result. Larger studies would be needed for a clear answer.  It is not scientifically plausible that homeopathic remedies are effective."
Do agents containing uridine and/or cytidine improve the symptoms of polyneuropathy?,"['Despite searching in three large databases, we have not been able to find any studies that met these criteria.', 'Whether drugs with uridine and/or cytidine actually help with polyneuropathia, we cannot estimate on this basis.']",1,"The claim cannot be supported or refuted based on the provided sentences, as there is no evidence found in three large databases regarding the impact of agents containing uridine and/or cytidine on polyneuropathy symptoms.",We have not been able to find any meaningful studies on this question.
Can regular exercise prevent you from getting a cold or other respiratory infections???,"['People who practice sports on a regular basis are likely to suffer as often from respiratory infections as sports muffles.', 'The studies suggest that although the number of infections can not be reduced by sport, it may be a little milder for the duration of the disease and for the duration of the disease as a whole.']",2,"While regular exercise may not prevent the occurrence of respiratory infections, it could potentially lessen their severity and duration, as suggested by the studies.","Previous studies suggest that sports-playing people may be just as likely to have respiratory infections as sports-muffle people. However, the illnesses are likely to be somewhat less severe and a bit shorter overall."
"Can the Wim Hof method - consisting of breathing training, meditation and acclimatization to cold - strengthen the immune system of healthy people and thus prevent infectious diseases?","['Cold without proven effect for health For none of these promises there is evidence.', 'The study also cannot answer whether trained people reacted less strongly to the bacterial poison than non-trained people – because they lack accurate data.', 'Even if the study had been carried out better, the extent to which this actually brings health benefits such as a reduced risk of infectious diseases is entirely speculative.', 'Even if it were better methodically, it could not answer whether it is the cold that does anything.', 'The cold records from Wim Hof are partly impressive, but whether cold training has a health benefit can not prove this study.']",1,The study's limitations and lack of evidence for a causal relationship prevent confirmation of the claim that the Wim Hof method strengthens the immune system to prevent infectious diseases.,"There are individual small studies on the Wim Hof method, but they are poor and inconclusive. Whether the method reduces the probability of infectious diseases has never been researched."
Do saw palmetto preparations improve the symptoms of benign enlarged prostate (benign prostatic hyperplasia) in the longer term compared to placebo?,"['No better than placebo The two systematic overviews [1,2] come to the conclusion in the summary in agreement: The saw palm preparations do not relieve prostate problems better than a sham medication.', 'In other studies that tested saw palm as an addition to tamsulosin, the addition of saw palm did not bring any extra benefit.']",2,The two systematic overviews and additional studies show that saw palmetto preparations do not alleviate prostate problems more effectively than a placebo or when added to tamsulosin.,"According to current studies, remedies with saw palmetto do not improve the symptoms of a benign enlarged prostate in the longer term more than a placebo. This assessment is well supported."
Does honey help against acute cough in children?,"['Probably effective – a little It turned out that honey as an anti-cough remedy is likely to have a certain justification.', 'With honey, the severity of the cough was about 2 points better the next day.', 'Thus, honey can obviously help children with acute cough a little by reducing discomfort and shortening their duration.', 'The shortening of the cough duration was also noticeable, but not spectacular: it was reduced from a good 5 days (with placebo) to about four and a half days (with honey).', 'Thus, honey is likely to have a positive effect both on the duration of coughing and on the symptoms associated with coughing, albeit on a modest scale.']",0,"The sentences provide evidence that honey may modestly alleviate cough severity and reduce its duration in children, supporting the claim.","Honey should help children with acute cough: The coughing attacks are likely to become somewhat less frequent, weaker and less distressing. Children's and parents' sleep may also improve, and the time to resolution is likely to be a little shorter. However, the effects achieved are only small."
Can Artemisia tea cure malaria as well as drugs?,"['And even if there were no problems with resistance – it is questionable whether Artemisia remedies from non-professional self-cultivation could reliably compete with the standardized quality of artemisinin drugs.', 'Based on the studies available to us, we can neither clearly demonstrate nor completely exclude the benefit of Artemisia tea for sustainable malaria treatment with low relapse probability.']",1,"The claim that Artemisia tea can cure malaria as well as drugs is not clearly supported by the provided sentences, as one states the difficulty in reliably competing with standardized artemisinin drugs, and the other indicates unclear or partially excluded benefits for sustainable malaria treatment with low relapse probability.","Four studies with a total of relatively few participants come to contradictory results. Since all studies have problems, we cannot draw any meaningful conclusions about the healing success - i.e., we can neither confirm nor exclude a positive lasting effect."
Does thyme help against cough?,"[""We couldn't find a single clinical trial that investigated exclusively thyme for an effect against cough."", 'Conjectures without evidence Although it is not proven that ingredients of the thyme can actually relieve cough, it is also not refuted.', 'However, there is no scientific evidence to date that the mucus solution itself has a relieving or shortening effect on cough [7,8].', 'Therefore, it cannot be said directly whether thyme alone can relieve cough.']",1,"While there is no clinical trial evidence specifically investigating thyme's effect on cough, and no scientific proof of its mucus solution relieving or shortening cough, it remains unproven but also unrefuted that thyme's ingredients can alleviate cough.",Whether thyme is effective against cough has not yet been researched in meaningful studies.
Does coenzyme Q10 relieve muscle discomfort during treatment with statins?,"['In seven studies, the coenzyme Q10 group was no better than the placebo group.', 'When the research team removed this study from the overall evaluation, the remaining studies came together to a relatively similar result: Coenzyme Q10 does not help better than a sham medication.']",1,"The seven studies collectively show no benefit of coenzyme Q10 over a placebo in alleviating muscle discomfort during statin treatment, and this conclusion remains unchanged when one study is excluded.","Several studies come to contradictory results. In addition, the range of variation in the estimated effect is very large, and the individual studies have certain shortcomings. On this basis, no firm conclusions can be drawn."
Does Chaga mushroom help against cancer or other diseases?,"['Such study results cannot say anything concrete about the effect in the human body.', 'It is therefore impossible to answer whether the chaga mushroom can cure or prevent diseases.']",1,"The claim that Chaga mushroom helps against cancer or other diseases cannot be confirmed or refuted based on the provided sentences, as they state that study results cannot make concrete statements about its effect in the human body, and it's impossible to definitively say whether it can cure or prevent diseases.",The effect of Chaga mushrooms has not yet been investigated in studies with humans.
Is strophanthin an effective cardiovascular drug?,"['Furthermore, the positive results of strophanthin are not credible according to studies.', ""Whether strophanthin relieves symptoms of coronary heart disease or heart failure better than today's standard medications, can therefore not be derived from these studies."", 'Whether strophanthine has a benefit in this respect, the two found studies do not answer.']",1,"The provided sentences, which include a skeptical view of strophanthin's positive results and an absence of evidence for its superiority over standard medications, do not provide enough information to support the claim of its effectiveness as a cardiovascular drug.","We found two small flawed studies. They only investigated whether complaints improve in the short term, but not the long-term effect on disease progression and deaths. Since the studies are quite old, it is also not possible to assess how strophanthin compares with modern, well-studied drugs."
Can taking vitamin C after the onset of a cold relieve symptoms or shorten the illness?,"['Symptom treatment probably without effect The recommendation to take high-dose vitamin C at the first signs of a cold cannot be confirmed by studies.', 'The combined results of previous studies do not show that vitamin C can relieve cold symptoms.']",2,"The claim that vitamin C can relieve cold symptoms or shorten the illness is refuted by the combined results of previous studies, which do not show any symptom relief from vitamin C.","Preventive intake of high-dose vitamin C for a long time does not prevent the occurrence of colds.

Does a diet that includes as many organic foods as possible lower the risk of cancer?,"['Both studies can neither prove nor refute that organic foods protect against cancer.', 'Furthermore, the authors cannot rule out that there is another explanation for the lower risk of cancer in the French study: for example, it could also be that the proponents of bio-foods have reduced the likelihood of cancer for quite different reasons, for example through factors such as income, education or access to the health system.', 'Overall, it remains questionable whether a diet with a high proportion of organic food can reduce the risk of cancer.', 'Therefore, it remains unclear whether the slightly lower number of cancer cases in the French study was really due to the diet with more organic food.', 'Conclusion Overall, all data can neither prove nor refute the established thesis.']",1,"While two studies cannot confirm or deny the protective effects of organic foods against cancer, it is also plausible that other factors, such as income, education, or healthcare access, could explain the lower cancer risk observed in one study, leaving the claim's validity uncertain.","To date, only two studies have been published that have explored a possible link between the consumption of organic products and cancer risk. Both publications have methodological flaws. Moreover, they contradict each other: One suggests that people with higher organic consumption are less likely to develop cancer, while the second study found no differences between organic and conventional diets."

Do amalgam fillings affect the mental development of school children compared to plastic dental fillings?,"['Although the study authors found slightly higher amounts of mercury in the body in children with amalgam fillings, the levels were well below the level of health concern [6, 14].', 'Overall, it is unlikely that amalgam fillings will affect the mental abilities of children.', 'The amalgam did not seem to be the cause of the complaints, even if those persons who could remove the fillings had slightly lower mercury levels [4].', 'Amalgam had no negative effects on the intelligence, memory or concentration of the children.']",2,"The claim is refuted by the sentences, as they indicate that amalgam fillings do not negatively impact the mental abilities of children, with mercury levels remaining below health concern levels.","Children who receive at least one amalgam filling between the ages of six and ten have slightly more mercury in their bodies than their peers with plastic fillings. However, these levels are almost certainly too low to impair mental abilities such as intelligence, concentration and memory over a five-year period. This is what previous studies have shown. Little research has been done on the possible effects of amalgam fillings on children under the age of six and, in the case of pregnant women, on their unborn offspring.

So it remains open whether the DMPS test really benefits people who suspect heavy metal poisoning. However, risks of DMPS are known. All in all, this diagnostic tool therefore does not appear to be recommendable."
Can stevia lower high blood pressure?,"['Although this trend was observed in a systematic review, the effect was very small [5].', 'We found a systematic review of the effect of blood pressure lowering.', 'Due to the blood pressure lowering effect, people with low blood pressure should be careful with the sweetener.']",0,"The review showed a minimal blood pressure lowering effect, but cautions those with already low blood pressure.","With all foods, ""the dose makes the poison"". As a sugar-free sweetener, substances from the stevia plant do not promote tooth decay and have no calories. A medical benefit beyond that may be an effectiveness against high blood pressure."
Is eating genetically modified corn a health concern?,"['Unexplored hazards for humans Whether genetically modified maize varieties can pose a potential health risk for humans is still little researched.', 'Little meaningful On closer examination, however, these abnormalities proved to be of little significance, since they could have occurred by chance.', 'In any case, there is no concrete evidence of a noticeable toxicity of genetically modified maize plants for humans in scientific literature – with a share of 70% of all maize plants grown in the USA.', '[6] Nevertheless, there are no investigations to exclude possible rare long-term effects in humans – after all, a human being differs significantly from a rat in several characteristics.']",1,"While some studies suggest unexplored long-term health risks for humans and genetically modified maize, the majority of scientific literature shows no concrete evidence of noticeable toxicity in humans, who differ significantly from rats in several characteristics.",Several feeding studies in rats over short periods of time provide no clear indications of a health concern for various genetically modified corn varieties Whether side effects may occur over a longer period of time cannot be answered due to the lack of conclusive long-term studies in humans.
Is a gluten-free diet recommended for people who do not have celiac disease?,"['Whether gluten itself does not actually cause digestive problems, if one does not suffer from celiac disease, has to be examined better in larger studies.', 'Hardly surprising, there are no solid long-term studies on healthy individuals on the risks of a gluten-free diet.', 'Currently, there are no convincing studies that argue for the absence of gluten by healthy people.', 'So we currently do not know whether a gluten-free diet has long-term advantages.', 'Overall, the studies conducted so far on gluten-free nutrition in people without celiac disease are not meaningful.']",1,"While some studies question the direct impact of gluten on digestive health in non-celiac individuals, there is a lack of solid long-term research supporting the benefits of a gluten-free diet for this group.","There are no well-done studies that have investigated gluten abstinence in people who do not suffer from the autoimmune disease celiac disease. Therefore, there is a lack of reliable data on the possible benefits of a long-term gluten-free diet in the general population.

Does the plant substance nobiletin contained in mandarins protect against weight gain?,"['Mandarin active substance for overweight laboratory mice No, most likely not: Nobiletin occurs mainly in the shell of mandarins.', '...but no studies in humans The results of this animal study are not easily transferable to humans.', 'Therefore, no evidence of the efficacy of the mandarin active substance can be made for humans until results have been obtained.', 'Whether the study participants have also lost weight has not been investigated.', 'The claim that mandarins can protect against obesity is not scientifically valid at the moment.']",1,"The claim is not scientifically valid at this time since nobiletin's effectiveness in preventing weight gain has not been proven in human studies, and it is mainly found in the mandarin peel.","In genetically modified laboratory mice, the additional administration of nobiletin to a high-fat and high-sugar diet appears to be able to prevent obesity. Such an effect has not yet been studied in humans."
Does consumption of dairy products in middle and advanced age protect against bone fractures?,"['Milk and dairy products no protection against broken bones Healthy bones need calcium, and milk contains a lot of it.', 'But the consumption of calcium-rich dairy products alone is not enough for strong bones.', 'An analysis of all relevant studies up to 2010 speaks more clearly: The results indicate that dairy products have no influence on the probability of developing a fracture of the thigh neck at an age of over 40 years [1] A summary of those studies published until 2015 also comes to the same conclusion [1a].Nevertheless, it is still too early to provide clear evidence.', 'However, it also indicates that dairy products are ineffective in preventing bone fractures [2].', 'Effect at a young age unclear Whether the consumption of dairy products in youth can influence the probability of bone fractures in old age is not sufficiently investigated at present.']",2,The claim that dairy product consumption in middle and advanced age protects against bone fractures is refuted by the statements indicating multiple analyses of relevant studies up to 2010 and 2015 concluding that dairy products have no influence on the probability of developing a thigh neck fracture at an age over 40 years.,Those who are 40 or older and consume a lot of dairy products do not seem to be able to reduce their risk of age-related bone fractures.
Is the milk of horn-bearing cows less rich in allergens and more easily tolerated by lactose-intolerant individuals?,"['In the above-mentioned doctoral thesis, the comparison of proteins in the milk of cows with and without horns is based only on a few exemplary samples – far too little and too imprecise to come to a durable statement.', 'The author has not investigated whether milk-allergic persons actually react to one of the two types of milk with less complaints.', 'Also that the milk of horned cows is better tolerated for lactose-intolerant people, the data of the doctoral thesis in no way show.', 'In some respects, they are more stringent than bio-criteria, which are therefore exceeded in Demeter operations.']",1,"The claim is not supported by the sentences provided, as the doctoral thesis only used a small number of samples, did not investigate milk-allergic reactions to each type of milk, and did not show that the milk of horned cows is better tolerated by lactose-intolerant individuals.",There is no well-done study that would provide conclusive scientific evidence to support these questions.
"Does daily flossing protect against tooth decay, periodontitis and tooth loss?","['Study situation not sufficient for dental floss recommendation Although prayer mill-like repeated, the effectiveness of dental floss for dental health has in fact hardly been studied more closely so far.', 'It is therefore not clear whether floss actually results in rare caries, gum inflammation or periodontitis or if the teeth are preserved longer.', 'Whether the additional effort is worthwhile for people with healthy teeth and intact gums remains as open as the question of to what extent floss can help with severe inflammation of the gums.', 'In fact, there is evidence that the correct cleaning technique with floss could be decisive for the success and avoidance of side effects: The lateral tooth surfaces should therefore be freed from tooth coverings by careful up-and-down movements [1] [2] [5].', 'The studies so far do not really help: because they have observed too few people over too short periods of time and are partly of poor quality, they do not provide sufficient basis for the general recommendation to use floss every day and from childhood onwards.']",1,"The claim that daily flossing protects against tooth decay, periodontitis, and tooth loss is not supported by the provided sentences, as there is a lack of substantial studies demonstrating its effectiveness and the role of correct cleaning technique in its success remains unclear.","It is possible that regular flossing of the interdental spaces can help with mild gingivitis.

Does music therapy promote recovery from severe limitations of consciousness after severe brain injury?,"['Effects of music therapy too little investigated In a detailed literature research, we have only been able to promote few relevant investigations to the surface.', 'None of the studies found involved music as a single treatment for severe brain damage and unconsciousness.', 'Most studies have had very few patients, have serious methodological deficiencies and do not answer the question whether the patients actually achieve significant and long-term improvements in consciousness through treatment.', 'This makes it unclear whether the results are transferable to people who have been in a wake-up coma or minimal state of consciousness for a long time.', 'In addition, it is unclear whether the results of the study can also be transferred to other forms of treatment such as playing familiar pieces of music.']",1,"The claim is not sufficiently supported because the studies investigating music therapy's effects on severe brain injury are limited, with small sample sizes, methodological deficiencies, and unclear applicability to long-term consciousness improvements or other forms of treatment.","We have not found any high-quality studies that specifically investigate the effect of music therapy. Some scientists explored the influence of stimulation of the senses, in which acoustic stimuli are also used.

Can eating grapefruit in combination with some medications lead to harmful interactions?,"['A whole range of different medicines should be able to have serious health consequences in combination with grapefruits – either as fruit or as juice.', '85 medicines have been found, the effect of which may be influenced by the consumption of grapefruits.', 'A list of medicines for which severe side effects have been observed or suspected in combination with grapefruit can be found at the end of this article.', 'In some cases, the consumption of a single fruit or a glass of grapefruit juice appears to be sufficient, in other cases harmful overdoses were observed only after days or weeks of regular consumption.', 'The thrombosis-promoting effect of ethinylestradiol, a main active substance of conventional contraceptive pills, is increased by grapefruits.']",0,"The claim is supported by the sentences, as they mention various medications whose effects can be altered by grapefruit consumption, including ethinylestradiol, a main active substance of contraceptive pills, with potential thrombosis-promoting effects.","Yes, grapefruits can enhance the effects of some medications. However, the risk, type, and severity of side effects are only partially known, depend on the particular drug, and likely vary from person to person."
Can regular consumption of chocolate prevent cardiovascular disease?,"['An analysis of long-term studies investigating the relationship between chocolate consumption and cardiovascular disease indicates a significantly reduced risk.', 'In a period of eight to 16 years, regular chocolate consumption decreased the likelihood of developing a heart attack, stroke or related disease by about a third [1].', 'An overview of the results of individual studies to date showed a positive influence of flavonoid-rich chocolate and cocoa products on the blood pressure of study participants.', 'Long-term effect unclear Short-term studies over a few weeks, which only examined the effect of chocolate, provide evidence that chocolate could at least temporarily lower too high blood pressure and cholesterol levels, albeit only to a very small extent.']",0,"Regular chocolate consumption's long-term potential in preventing cardiovascular disease is suggested by studies indicating reduced risk and positive influences on blood pressure, despite short-term studies showing only minor temporary effects on blood pressure and cholesterol.","It is possible, but by no means certain, that chocolate could reduce the risk of developing cardiovascular disease such as heart attack or stroke. However, the high proportion of sugar and fat in most types of chocolate could also have negative effects."

Are diets with reduced carbohydrate content better for weight loss than other weight loss programs?,"['However, there is no evidence that they work better than fat-reduced diets or programs that put on a balanced nutrient combination [1-4].', 'Therefore, it cannot be completely ruled out that individual studies have shown the effects of low-carb diets a little more positive than they actually were.', 'In summary, the four overviews show very similar results: Low-carb diets are comparable to other diets, but more weight than with conventional weight loss programs can probably not be lost in the long term.']",2,"The claim that low-carb diets are better for weight loss than other programs is not supported, as multiple overviews indicate similar results between low-carb and other diets, with no significant long-term weight loss advantage.","There is much evidence to suggest that, in the case of obesity, low-carbohydrate diets lead to at least comparable weight loss over one to two years as fat-reduced diets or weight-loss programs with a balanced diet."
Is Bulletproof Coffee recommended?,"['Conclusion Published studies with human subjects who have dealt with the subject of Bulletproof Coffee are not available.', 'It also lacks the basis to make statements about side effects and long-term safety of this food form.', 'Thus it should not be quite easy to make various effects dingfest.', 'Ingredients under the microscope We have not found any clinical studies on the effects of Bulletproof Coffee.', 'However, there are still various unexplained aspects around these references.']",1,"The claim cannot be definitively supported or refuted due to the lack of published human studies and clinical evidence on the effects of Bulletproof Coffee, as stated in the sentences.","Bulletproof coffee is high in caffeine and fat. Is the hip breakfast substitute a kind of fitness potion? Or is it even harmful? Because there have been no studies on this coffee blend with human test subjects, we cannot make any reliable statements."
Does skipping breakfast increase heart attack risk?,"['Obviously, therefore, the main reason for the increased risk of heart attacks was not to skip the morning meal, but overweight, diabetes, increased blood pressure, or too high cholesterol levels.', 'Thus, it is unclear whether the omission of breakfast leads to overweight or excess weight leads to the omission of breakfast.']",1,"The claim is not directly supported or refuted by the sentences, as one sentence suggests other factors like overweight and high cholesterol as the main reasons for increased heart attack risk, while the other sentence questions the causality between skipping breakfast and being overweight.","There is no clear evidence that not eating breakfast could be a cause of obesity and, as a consequence, an increased risk of heart attack. It is possible, however, that it is primarily those people who are overweight and have a higher heart risk who forgo their morning meal."
Do whole grains lower the likelihood of dying early?,"['Against cancer, heart problems and diabetes The current study situation shows something else: Those who frequently resort to whole grains get less cancer or cardiovascular diseases, for example a heart attack [1–4].', 'Thus, people in whom whole grains play a major role in their daily diet seem to live longer and healthier.', 'All four summaries come to the same conclusion: They show a clear correlation between a full-grain diet and a reduced chance of dying early.', 'At least as far as the reduced risk of disease is concerned, the data show a robust dose-effect relationship: the more whole grains are eaten, the lower the risk of disease [6].']",0,"The sentences provide evidence supporting the claim that whole grains lower the likelihood of dying early, as they indicate a correlation between whole grain consumption and reduced risk of disease, as well as longer and healthier lifespans.",People who eat whole grain products instead of foods made from refined flour are likely to live longer and probably have a lower risk of dying from cancer or cardiovascular disease.
Does regular consumption of energy drinks harm heart health?,"['Thus, energy drinks could potentially increase heart rate and blood pressure in the short term, but this is not the case in all studies.', 'However, the fact that the energy drinks had caused death is not certain.', 'There is no evidence that caffeine can cause cardiac arrhythmias or atrial fibrillation at moderate doses.', 'Larger doses of energy drinks can cause, for example, heart turf, tremor, arousal and digestive problems.']",1,"While energy drinks may transiently increase heart rate and blood pressure, there is no definitive evidence linking them to heart-related deaths or caffeine-induced cardiac arrhythmias at moderate doses, and larger doses primarily cause non-cardiac issues like tremors and digestive problems.",This question is insufficiently researched. Larger studies over a longer period of time are needed to assess the heart risk from energy drinks.
Do light drinks promote obesity?,"['However, the fact that sweeteners actually affect blood sugar and insulin levels has not been proven.', 'The largest work, a summary analysis of three studies involving a total of 125,000 participants [7], comes to the opposite conclusion – light drinks should therefore reduce the weight slightly.', 'No scientific evidence whether artificially sweetened lemonades promote the development of overweight is therefore not yet available.']",1,"While a summary analysis of three studies suggests that light drinks might slightly reduce weight, there is no scientific evidence proving that artificially sweetened lemonades promote overweight development, making it unclear if light drinks contribute to obesity.","Several cohort studies show that people who frequently drink light drinks are more likely to be overweight. However, this does not prove that sweetener drinks make you fat. For it is equally conceivable that overweight people try to lose weight with light drinks. Whether they are successful in doing so is unclear."
Does coffee reduce the risk of dementia?,"['Scientists from Finland even want to find out that regular coffee drinking may also keep the brain fresh in the long term, in which it protects against dementia [1] [2].', 'And in fact, the scientists were able to establish a positive connection, but this effect seems to be above all a question of the coffee dose: the mental decline occurred most rarely during the course of the study in people who drank an average of one or two cups a day.', 'From the data from a total of eleven individual studies, the scientists concluded that people who consume a lot of caffeine had a reduced risk of dementia by about one-sixth (16%).', 'Further studies are necessary There are indications that people who drink a moderate amount of coffee daily are less at risk of developing cognitive disorders in the long term.']",0,"The claim is supported by the sentences, as scientists found a positive connection between regular coffee consumption and reduced risk of dementia, with the most significant effect observed in individuals drinking an average of one or two cups a day.",One to two cups of coffee a day may protect against mental decline in the long term. It should not be more than that. It is unclear where this effect comes from and whether other caffeinated beverages might also be protective.
Does sugar consumption increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes regardless of obesity?,"['Soft drinks increase the risk of diabetes People with a preference for large amounts of sugar-containing sodas also suffer more frequently from diabetes.', 'In their analyses, two research teams [1,2] were able to independently show that the more sugar the study participants consume in the form of soft drinks, the higher the probability of developing type 2 diabetes.', 'It seems that daily consumption of sugared soft drinks can trigger diabetes over many years even if it does not make you fat.', 'Sugar content of other foods with unclear influence The association with type 2 diabetes is relatively clear for soft drinks.']",0,"While soft drink sugar consumption is strongly associated with increased type 2 diabetes risk, potentially independent of obesity, the impact of sugar from other food sources remains unclear, leaving the claim partially unsupported.","Sugar-containing soft drinks can - if consumed regularly - cause obesity. Obesity, in turn, increases the likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes. However, sugared soft drinks probably also increase the risk of diabetes independently of obesity."
Is less eaten from red plates?,"['The result: The test subjects who were served their pretzels on red plates accessed significantly less than participants with blue or white plates.', 'In a second experiment, subjects also drank soft drinks in a larger amount of blue instead of red cups.', 'As logical as this explanation may sound, the study does not yet provide scientific evidence that red plates really eat less.', 'In both salty and sweet snacks, the participants gained less when they were lying on a red plate in front of them.']",0,"The study suggests that people consume less from red plates, as indicated by the reduced intake of pretzels and snacks on red plates compared to blue or white ones, but this observation needs further scientific validation to confirm the causality.","In two psychological experiments, participants were less likely to eat salty pretzels, popcorn or chocolate chips if they were served on red plates. It is unclear whether the effect lasts over a longer period of time."
Does breastfeeding reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome?,"['The scientists conclude that the risk of breastfed children is halved compared to un breastfed children [2].', 'However, the matter has a small catch: the studies analysed show a connection.', 'The studies in detail The fact that breastfeeding reduces the risk of unexpected death of a baby is only moderately secure.', 'However, this does not necessarily prove that breastfeeding is the reason for the lower risk of infant death.']",0,"While the studies suggest a connection between breastfeeding and a reduced risk of sudden infant death syndrome, they do not definitively prove that breastfeeding is the cause of this lower risk.","Breastfeeding can possibly reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome, but this is not entirely certain.

"Do boron preparations such as borax, boric acid, or calcium fructoborate relieve pain associated with age-related joint wear (osteoarthritis)?","['Even if their authors want to give a positive impression in their work – a critical look at the data shows that the Borax tablets could not alleviate arthrosis complaints among the participants.', 'There is no evidence that borax or boric acid can actually improve the discomfort in people with worn joints.', 'Those who suffer from chronic osteoarthritis pains and stiff joints and are hoping for relief through Borax should rely on more effective alternatives.']",1,"The claim that boron preparations like borax or boric acid alleviate pain associated with osteoarthritis is not supported by the sentences, which mention the inability of Borax to reduce arthrosis complaints and the lack of evidence for borax or boric acid improving discomfort in people with worn joints.","The few studies on this are of poor quality and therefore not trustworthy. Moreover, there is no evidence that the human body needs boron at all."
Can glutamate in food cause intolerance symptoms?,"['There are many case reports of an alleged glutamate hypersensitivity, but these can hardly be verified.', 'But among the alleged glutamate-sensitive subjects there was no one who showed symptoms after all glutamate [3].', 'The available studies show that up to three grams of glutamate does not cause symptoms in a selected group of healthy individuals.']",1,"While there are claims of glutamate hypersensitivity, no individual in a selected group showed symptoms after consuming all glutamate, and up to three grams of glutamate did not cause symptoms in healthy individuals, providing insufficient evidence to directly support or refute the claim of glutamate in food causing intolerance symptoms.","There is no conclusive evidence that the consumption of glutamate triggers complaints. However, since studies conducted to date have shown deficiencies, it cannot be ruled out that there are isolated individuals who react sensitively to large amounts of glutamate."
Does the Orthopulse device accelerate the orthodontic correction of malocclusions?,"['Little meaningful The three published studies [1-3] cannot convince: None of the studies actually investigates the entire duration of treatment, but only the speed of tooth movements in the correction phase of brace therapy.', 'This does not make any sure statements about the reduction of the overall duration of treatment with which the manufacturer advertises.', 'Theoretically, two effects of orthopulses would be conceivable: positive effects if the duration of treatment were shortened, or negative effects if conversion processes at the tooth root were accelerated.', 'Thus, it is also questionable whether the faster treatment with the orthopulse device actually results from infrared therapy: In the control group, the teeth move on average by 0.44 mm per week, in the group with the orthopulse device on average by 1.27 mm per week.']",1,"While the studies mentioned do not cover the entire treatment duration and there is a theoretical possibility of negative effects, the data shows a significant increase in weekly tooth movement with the Orthopulse device, which may suggest a shortened treatment duration.",Poorly done studies show that the device can accelerate tooth movement in the short term. Whether this reduces the overall treatment time has not yet been sufficiently proven. The methodological weaknesses of the studies also mean that the results are not very credible. Possible side effects have not yet been sufficiently investigated.
Is it harmful for the mental development of the unborn child if the mother regularly eats fish contaminated with mercury during pregnancy?,"['For previous studies suggest that the consumption of larger amounts of mercury-containing fish could slightly affect the mental performance of the offspring [1, 2, 3].', 'The studies in detail The fact that methyl mercury can damage the brain of unborn children already in concentrations in which the pregnant mothers themselves do not notice any symptoms is beyond question [6].', 'In investigations into the Faroe Islands and New Zealand, the assumption was confirmed: expectant mothers with high mercury levels were given children, whose mental performance was on average slightly worse in later tests than that of unloaded mothers – the mercury levels of the mothers were mostly so high, because they had consumed large amounts of contaminated fish before and during pregnancy.', 'Impact on the IQ Despite these contradictions, the consumption of contaminated fish seems to reduce the intelligence of the offspring measurable, although it is not yet clear how much.', ""A research team at Harvard University calculated an average reduction in the intelligence ratio of 0.7 points for each micrograms of mercury in mother's hair [2] in the analysis of studies from the Faroe Islands, Seychelles and New Zealand.""]",0,"The claim is supported by the sentences, as multiple studies suggest a correlation between mercury-contaminated fish consumption during pregnancy and slightly reduced mental performance in offspring, with a calculated average IQ reduction of 0.7 points for each microgram of mercury in the mother's hair.","Many commercially available types of edible fish are contaminated with traces of methyl mercury. There are indications that regular consumption of such mercury-containing fish during pregnancy can impair the brain development of unborn children and thus their later mental abilities. In contrast, consumption of fish low in mercury could promote brain development in the unborn."
Can the consumption of caffeine during pregnancy harm the unborn child?,"['However, the study showed that it made no difference whether the participants drank around three cups of caffeine or decaffeinated coffee.', ""On average, the weight of birth at birth was about the same, was similar in size and was not more frequently born too early even after the mother's caffeine consumption."", 'Similar to the summary of the Cochrane overview work: In early pregnancy three cups of coffee daily would have no effect on birth weight, growth or premature birth [2].']",1,"The study and Cochrane overview work found no significant differences in birth weight, size, or premature birth between mothers who consumed caffeine and those who consumed decaffeinated coffee during pregnancy, supporting the claim that caffeine consumption does not harm the unborn child.",There is insufficient evidence that moderate consumption of caffeinated beverages would have a negative impact on the child's development. Up to three cups of coffee a day does not appear to reduce the child's birth weight. Very large amounts of caffeine-containing beverages could possibly contribute to lower birth weight.
Are vegetables prepared in a microwave oven less healthy than those prepared in other ways?,"['Recent studies see the matter more differentiated: Depending on the variety of vegetables and the exact type of preparation, the microwave can sometimes be better and sometimes worse suited than, for example, cooking [2-12].', 'In the worst case, if it is exaggerated with the duration and the number of watts, the corresponding food is less health-promoting, but in no way harmful to health.', 'If there are health problems related to the microwave, then this is not because the microwave ingredients are destroyed or changed, but because it is simply too unhealthy to eat altogether.', 'The week-long feeding with always several times warmed up in the microwave has not led to any signs of poisoning in the animals.']",2,"While the microwave can sometimes be less suitable than other methods for preparing vegetables, depending on the type and duration of cooking, there is no evidence that it destroys or changes ingredients in a way that makes vegetables harmful to health, even after prolonged warming.","How vegetables change during preparation is extremely variable. With any type of heating, ingredients can be lost or become more easily accessible. In sum, it cannot be said that preparation in the microwave is always a bad choice."
Can garlic extract reduce high blood pressure and thus the risk of cardiovascular disease?,"['Two better performed randomised-controlled studies provide cautious evidence that garlic can lower too high blood pressure [1].', 'However, even the results of these two studies are insufficiently valid for a clear assessment [1].', 'Whether garlic taken regularly can lower too high blood pressure and thus lower the risk of cardiovascular disease remains unclear for the time being.', 'At least in theory, there may also be interactions with anticoagulant drugs or side effects in persons with a tendency to bleed, as garlic is suspected to have an anticoagulant effect.']",1,"While two studies suggest garlic can lower high blood pressure, their validity is questioned, leaving unclear whether regular garlic use reduces cardiovascular disease risk, and potentially interacting with anticoagulant drugs or causing side effects in those prone to bleeding due to garlic's suspected anticoagulant effect.","Studies to date provide tentative evidence of a blood pressure-lowering effect of garlic. However, they are of too low quality to be able to prove a reduction in the risk of cardiovascular disease as a result of high blood pressure."
Can fructose damage the liver?,"['Fruit sugar as a cause not proven There are no meaningful indications for the assumption that fruit sugar is responsible for the development of the liver disease [1].', 'In other words, for the liver, it may not matter what kind of sugar you eat.']",1,"While there is no concrete evidence linking fructose to liver disease development, the type of sugar consumed may not significantly impact the liver, according to the provided sentences.",There is no conclusive evidence for a possible liver-damaging effect of fructose.
Is matcha tea particularly healthy?,"['No recommendations, no warnings Due to the current study situation, it is therefore not possible to make specific recommendations for tea consumption.', 'The studies in detail Matcha is the trend for many consumers, but in scientific literature this special green tea hardly exists.']",1,"Despite matcha tea's popularity among consumers, the lack of extensive scientific studies on its specific benefits makes it difficult to make definitive health recommendations.","There is a lack of conclusive studies on the health effects of specific matcha. However, there is some evidence that green tea in general may reduce the likelihood of dying prematurely, especially from cardiovascular disease."
Can acupuncture prevent migraines and tension headaches?,"['Acupuncture works... From chronic migraines or tension headaches Affected patients get significantly rare headache attacks when they not only take conventional medication, but also undergo prophylactic acupuncture treatment.', '...but as good as migraine medications Another point suggests that acupuncture has a valuable prophylactic effect – at least for migraine sufferers: Further studies showed that acupuncture can only partially prevent migraine attacks, but at least as well as common medications [1].']",0,"The claim is partially supported by the sentences, as they suggest acupuncture can reduce the frequency of migraines and tension headaches, although it may not completely prevent them, and its effectiveness is comparable to conventional medications.","In the case of migraine, the preventive effect of acupuncture is probably similar to that of prophylactic medication. However, for both migraine and tension headaches, acupuncture performs only slightly better than sham acupuncture. Whether the pricking of traditional acupuncture points plays a role is unclear."
Can plant sterols or foods with them reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease?,"['However, it is unclear whether the intake of such high amounts of plant sterols – e.g.', 'Whether these results are a coincidence or whether the higher rate of cardiovascular problems are actually due to plant sterols and not to other causes is unclear.', 'Cholesterol is also different Whether plant sterols can actually reduce not only LDL cholesterol levels, but also the risk of cardiovascular diseases, has not been investigated in a single clinical study.']",1,"While plant sterols have been shown to lower LDL cholesterol levels, there is no clinical study demonstrating that they can reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases specifically, leaving uncertainty about their role in cardiovascular disease prevention.","Plant sterols do lower cholesterol levels. However, whether they also reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease has not been researched. Animal studies even provide evidence that plant sterols in large quantities could increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. Whether this also applies to humans has not been investigated."
Can too much iodine cause autoimmune thyroid disease and consequently hypothyroidism?,"['Individual studies suggest that too large amounts of iodine may be responsible.', 'Probably a variety of causes These study results suggest that Hashimoto disease is more likely to occur in people with particularly high iodine consumption.', 'However, large amounts of iodine may cause serious disturbances in people with potentially undetected thyroid problems [8].', 'The studies in detail Whether large amounts of iodine can actually cause inflammation of the thyroid gland by an overreacting immune system is not well protected.', 'The result: the higher the iodine intake in a region, the greater the proportion of residents who suffer from autoimmune thyroid inflammation.']",0,"High iodine intake correlates with increased autoimmune thyroid inflammation, potentially triggering hypothyroidism in individuals with preexisting thyroid issues, although the exact mechanism is not well-established.",Autoimmune thyroid disease appears to occur more frequently in individuals with high iodine consumption. Whether high levels of iodine actually cause this disease has not been conclusively determined.
Is the sweetener aspartame harmful to health?,"['The result: the sweetener is in all probability safe.', 'Safety levels Based on the results of numerous studies in laboratory animals and humans, the scientists established a safety limit for aspartame.', 'Thus, every person can take 40 milligrams per kilogram of body weight every day for the rest of his life without fear of health consequences.', 'Even those who exceed this amount will not suffer any health hazard.']",2,"Based on the results of numerous studies, scientists have set a safety limit for aspartame, indicating that it is unlikely to be harmful to health even when consumed daily at levels above the established limit.","Health damage from aspartame is unlikely.

Does alpha lipoic acid help prevent or treat Alzheimer's disease?,"[""Thus, we do not know whether alpha lipoic acid can mitigate the disease or even protect it from Alzheimer's disease [1]."", 'Due to the few existing observational studies, they could not draw any conclusions or even make recommendations for the intake of alpha lipoic acid.', ""So we have no indication whether the intake of alpha lipoic acid by healthy people (from food, as a dietary supplement) can prevent Alzheimer's from breaking out at all.""]",1,"The claim that alpha lipoic acid helps prevent or treat Alzheimer's disease is not supported, as there is no evidence from the provided sentences indicating its disease-mitigating or preventative effects.",It remains to be seen whether alpha lipoic acid can help prevent or delay the onset of Alzheimer's disease. There is also a lack of conclusive studies on the question of the extent to which the substance can favorably influence the course of a disease that has already broken out.
Are Vemma products good for health?,"['Quickly clarified There is no reason to believe that Vemma products have any health benefits; according to our research, they were only once the subject of a medical study – which, however, is completely unusable due to serious defects [1] Vemma, on the other hand, was often the subject of investigations, since the distribution system is very reminiscent of a pyramid game [b] [c].', 'However, the results are worthless for several reasons: there is no information on how the random assignment to the trial or placebo group happened, whether the blinding has kept, whether and how a blinding of the treating physicians has happened at all, the results contradict text and graphics and in the statistical analysis also serious errors have been made [1].']",1,"The claim that Vemma products are good for health is not supported, as the only medical study on them had serious defects and the distribution system resembles a pyramid scheme, according to the provided sentences.","We have found only one study that investigates health effects of Vemma.

Does bioresonance therapy help with health complaints?,"['In this regard, the Commission refers primarily to physical opinions which allegedly show that the basic principles of bioresonance are incorrect [1], but also mentions three clinical studies which have shown ineffectiveness.', 'What to Know About Bioresonance There are no meaningful studies that certify efficacy of bioresonance, while two small clinical studies clearly speak against [7] [9].', 'The studies in detail The three studies already mentioned in the position name clearly show, on the one hand, that the method is not suitable for diagnosing allergies [8], on the other hand, they are only partly meaningful as a verification of efficacy – simply due to the low number of participants [7] [9].', 'Since 2006, some studies have been published, which allegedly speak for bioresonance, but most of them are scientifically worthless.']",2,"The claim that bioresonance therapy helps with health complaints is refuted by the Commission's reference to physical opinions contradicting the basic principles of bioresonance and three clinical studies showing its ineffectiveness, as well as the lack of meaningful studies supporting its efficacy and the questionable scientific value of studies claiming to support it.","Good studies on the question are hard to find. Due to the lack of proof of efficacy, the risk of misdiagnosis and the lack of plausibility, professional associations have been warning against bioresonance for some time."
Do irradiations with cold red light help with chronic gingivitis?,"['Few studies, no effect The few studies published so far indicate, however, that cold red light cannot effectively relieve such inflammations [1] [2] [3].', 'The fact that cold red light is intended to reduce pain after dental surgery can also not prove previous research results [4].', 'In none of these, the participating researchers were able to find an additional benefit of cold red light irradiation for the usual periodontitis treatment.', 'The summary analysis of existing studies does not indicate that cold red light can alleviate the consequences of dental surgery.']",2,"The claim that cold red light helps with chronic gingivitis is refuted by the studies mentioned, which found no additional benefit of cold red light irradiation for usual periodontitis treatment or alleviation of dental surgery consequences.",Previous studies indicate that chronic gingivitis and inflammation after dental surgery do not improve with irradiation with cold red light.
Does the Aspire system help you lose weight?,"['Whether this system leads to the desired weight loss, however, can not be said for sure at the present time.', 'However, it points to a strong effect: the study participants with the Aspire system lost an average of 21 kilograms in the first year, the comparison group only about 6 kilograms [1].', 'Patients with Aspire decreased an average of 21 kilograms in the first year, compared with about 6 kilograms in the comparative group.']",0,"The first year weight loss of 21 kilograms for Aspire system users, compared to 6 kilograms for the non-users, suggests that the Aspire system may help with weight loss, but the claim's uncertainty indicates that more time is needed to confirm this effect.","Although there is only one small study on this, it shows a very large effect - which indicates that it is effective."
Can FLEXISEQ ointment relieve osteoarthritis pain?,"[""So the ointment FLEXISEQ would have to be compared to a placebo ointment – that hasn't happened yet; compared to a medication to be swallowed, a placebo to be swallowed, and an ointment with an active substance, but its effectiveness itself is not too clear."", 'So it is not sure whether the ointment helps better than a suitable placebo.', 'The study duration in the four individual studies described is a maximum of 12 weeks, so long-term effects have not yet been investigated.']",1,"While there is no comparison to a placebo ointment or investigation into long-term effects, the direct comparison to other treatments is unclear, making it uncertain whether FLEXISEQ ointment alleviates osteoarthritis pain better than a suitable placebo.",Comparisons to date with other commonly used treatments are difficult to interpret but do not yield clear evidence of efficacy.
Can butterbur prevent migraine attacks?,"['In summary, both studies show that it is twice as likely that the number of migraine attacks will halve after twelve weeks with the Pestwurz preparation compared to a dummy medication.', 'The above overviews are of different quality, but all come to the same conclusions due to the two same studies: Pestwurz can reduce the number of migraine attacks for some patients.']",0,"Both studies summarized indicate that butterbur, referred to as Pestwurz, has shown a higher likelihood of reducing the frequency of migraine attacks compared to a placebo, supporting the claim.","Two well-done randomized-controlled trials show efficacy - the number of migraine attacks can probably be reduced with butterbur. Even if the effect is not huge, taking it may be worthwhile due to only minor side effects."
Does bisphenol A trigger allergies?,"['Hormone-like substances on the pill For BPA, the evidence of an allergy-promoting effect is currently not very strong.', 'The same study, which showed no correlation between the once measured BPA value in urine and existing allergies, found such association with the triclosan concentration in urine [2].']",1,"The claim that bisphenol A triggers allergies is not strongly supported by the evidence provided, as a study found no correlation between BPA urine levels and existing allergies, but did find an association with triclosan.","Individual observational studies suggest an association between bisphenol A intake and the development of asthma, but not allergy, in early childhood. Asthma is often the consequence of allergy. However, the measurement of bisphenol A intake in these studies is too imprecise for a clear statement."
Can maggots accelerate the healing of chronic wounds compared to conventional treatment?,"['Although the thorough cleansing of the wound is important for the healing process [2], there seems to be no indication that wounds heal faster after the maggot treatment [1].', 'Twelve months after the start of treatment, the number of subjects with healed chronic wounds in the maggot group was no greater than in patients with hydrogel associations.']",2,"The claim that maggots accelerate the healing of chronic wounds compared to conventional treatment is refuted by the sentences, as there is no evidence of faster healing in wounds treated with maggots versus hydrogel after twelve months.","Maggot therapy may not heal chronic wounds any faster than conventional wound care. However, the maggots seem to be able to clean the wound of dead tissue more quickly - but also cause more pain."
Do antidepressants from the group of serotonin reuptake inhibitors help with depression?,"['Even if not all questions have been finally clarified around the SSRI group, the current study situation has revealed the following: SSRIs are effective.', ""SSRIs are not ‘happy pills', the effects achieved are rather moderate."", 'SSRI can be helpful in severe and probably also moderate depression.', 'In fact, the study situation with SSRI, as measured by its wide spread, was rather modest over a long period of time.']",0,"The first sentence supports the claim that SSRIs are effective in treating depression, while the second sentence clarifies that their effects are moderate, not transforming users into a constantly happy state; the third sentence further corroborates the claim by stating SSRIs can be helpful in severe and probably moderate depression, despite a modest number of studies over a long period, as indicated in the fourth sentence.","Serotonin reuptake inhibitors have been shown to be helpful in more severe depression, although the exact mechanisms are not clear. Overall, very strong or rapid effects are not expected. For milder depression, efficacy is more debatable. Sometimes patients have to try several SSRI preparations until they feel an improvement in symptoms, and some sufferers are not helped by the drugs at all. Well-done studies should help clarify the situation in the future so that more targeted treatment is possible."
Is there a health risk from metal contaminants in lipsticks?,"['Risk in individual cases unclear The cited study by the team led by study leader Liu [1] analysed 32 products on their metal content.', 'The small amounts of lipstick thus do not lead to an increased risk of poisoning.', 'If the use of lipsticks is therefore a health risk when used very frequently, only more detailed and extensive studies can show.']",1,"While the study analyzed 32 products for metal content and found small amounts not leading to poisoning risk, the potential health risk from frequent use remains unclear without more detailed and extensive studies.","Several chemical analyses find traces of metals in lipsticks, which can in principle be harmful in high concentrations. However, the analyses do not examine the quantities in which the metals are actually absorbed and whether they cause damage in the body. Overall, there is still too little research into whether there could be a risk for some of the metal impurities if they are used very frequently."
Does particulate matter pollution increase the risk of heart attack - even if the EU limits are complied with?,"['The study of over 367,000 adults from 13 European countries indicates that long-term exposure to particulate matter generally increases the risk of mortality – meaning life-saving [1].', ""The authors reported that long-term exposure to particulate matter at the place of residence makes the occurrence of heart attack and unstable angina pectoris ('heart', a sign of an imminent heart attack) more likely."", 'An English cohort study from 2013 could not deduce a link between heart attack risk and fine dust air pollution, but fine dust exposure increased the risks of other heart diseases.', 'The short-term inhalation of larger amounts of fine dust may also make a heart attack more likely.']",0,"Long-term exposure to particulate matter can increase the risk of heart attack and unstable angina pectoris, supporting the claim that such pollution may still pose risks within EU limits, as the claim does not specify the level or duration of exposure.","Recent studies from Europe indicate that everyday exposure to particulate matter may increase the risk of acute heart disease (myocardial infarction, angina pectoris). General mortality may also be increased already by 'allowed' long-term exposure within the current EU limits."
Are endocrine disruptors in cosmetics a health risk?,"['Thus, the risk for parabens is not demonstrated by clinical studies, especially not by cosmetics.', 'Many chemicals are not researched at all, the interaction with certain diseases is unknown and it is also not sufficiently clear when and how endocrine disruptors intervene in the physical development of adolescents [b].', 'Humans are therefore exposed to many such influences, which makes risk assessment very difficult.']",1,"While there is no demonstrated risk for parabens in cosmetics, many endocrine disruptors remain under-researched, making it unclear how they interact with certain diseases and affect adolescent development, which complicates risk assessment.","Although many cosmetics do indeed contain substances that can influence the hormone system, a health risk has not been proven. Ecological consequences, on the other hand, have already been demonstrated."
"Can a dietary supplement containing omega-3 fatty acids, lipids, vitamins, and nutrients (""Souvenaid"") noticeably slow or halt the decline of mental performance in Alzheimer's disease?","['A comparison of the test values of the product and placebo groups with the end of the study shows no noticeable difference in the memory performance of the participants.', ""Two randomised-controlled studies for six to twelve months [4] and a third randomised-controlled study for 18 months [5] show that omega-3 fat-containing fish oil capsules cannot improve mental capacity in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease."", ""Whether one can prevent or delay the outbreak of Alzheimer's disease, if one regularly eats fish oil capsules, is not sufficiently investigated [6]."", ""Those who swallow preparations containing vitamin B6, B12 and folic acid should not be able to prevent mild to mild Alzheimer's disease from progressing [6].""]",2,"The claim is refuted by a randomized-controlled study showing that omega-3 fat-containing supplements do not improve mental capacity in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease, similar to the effect of vitamin B6, B12, and folic acid preparations on preventing disease progression.",Three randomized-controlled trials show that such a dietary supplement (Souvenaid®) is unlikely to markedly slow or halt the progression of Alzheimer's dementia. Taking omega-3 fatty acid or vitamin B supplements alone also does not appear to have such an effect.
Do vitamin E supplements increase the likelihood of early death?,"['The result: more deaths occur in the vitamin E group than in the comparison group without vitamin supplements.', 'This meta-analysis also results in a slightly increased number of deaths due to vitamin E preparations.', 'This calculates an increased risk of premature death in vitamin E intake by three percent [2].']",0,"The sentences provide evidence supporting the claim that vitamin E supplements increase the likelihood of early death, as they mention a higher number of deaths in the vitamin E group and a calculated increased risk of premature death.","Studies on this topic are very inconsistent.

Does eye training help prevent myopia?,"['A systematic review did not find a controlled study in 2005 that could show an effect of eye training on shortsightedness – nor any that would suggest a preventive effect of eye training [1].', 'For other forms of falseness, there are also small and methodologically weak studies that find no difference between eye training and a control group [1].', 'But in most cases there is no evidence of the effect of visual training [1] [3].']",2,"The systematic review and studies mentioned in the sentences do not provide evidence supporting the claim that eye training helps prevent myopia, and instead suggest a lack of effect.","According to the current state of studies, an effectiveness of eye training can only be expected for very few diseases; an effect as prevention or therapy against myopia cannot be assumed at present."
Does Cryolipolysis cause noticeable body fat reduction?,"['Whether the method can effectively reduce body fat cannot be said based on its results.', 'Whether the reason for the alleged figure improvements after three to six or twelve months was actually the cold treatment, however, can not be determined by previous-after-comparisons without an untreated control group anyway.', 'Even if the authors of previously published studies conjure the effectiveness of cryolipolysis – this cannot be objectively assessed on the basis of their results.']",1,"The claim that cryolipolysis causes noticeable body fat reduction cannot be substantiated based on the provided sentences, as they question the effectiveness of the method, the role of the cold treatment in observed improvements, and the objectivity of previous study results.","The effectiveness of cryolipolysis cannot be assessed objectively, as there are no scientific efficacy studies on it."
Is acupuncture for chronic pain more effective than placebo acupuncture treatment?,"['Acupuncture slightly surpasses dummy treatment A recent study is now to show that the pain-relieving effect of acupuncture exceeds that of a mere placebo effect, several media write.', 'The very thorough analysis of all these clinical studies showed that acupuncture in chronic pain was not only better than no treatment, but also slightly better than a sham acupuncture.', 'Also in fibromyalgia, a chronic pain disorder of the musculature, acupuncture probably has a slight, but hardly noticeably better effect than sham acupuncture [9].', 'Even if the mechanism of action of acupuncture is unknown and the placebo effect is partly responsible for its analgesic effect, it appears to be an interesting alternative or additional therapy for patients with chronic pain.']",0,"The analysis of clinical studies indicates that acupuncture has a slightly better effect on chronic pain than sham acupuncture, supporting the claim.","Acupuncture is slightly superior to sham acupuncture treatment for some types of pain. However, pain patients are unlikely to notice this difference."
Does treatment with radioactive agents help with pain in chronic inflammatory joint disease?,"['If the correct amount of a suitable radioactive substance is injected directly into the joint, the radiation causes the swollen and inflamed joint mucosa to die – after healing, a healthy skin can grow back, the inflammation is gone [1].', 'According to a 2009 overview study, success rates in small joints vary from 54 to 100 percent pain reduction 12 months after treatment, from 29 to 94 percent pain reduction in large joints [1].', 'A somewhat recent randomized-controlled study compared two drugs for radiosynoviorthesis and cortisone: after 48 weeks, the frequently used yttrium performed better than cortisone and the comparator, but only in a single point – namely on a particular pain scale.']",0,"The first sentence supports the claim by describing how radioactive substances can reduce inflammation in joints, while the second sentence provides success rates for pain reduction in small and large joints after treatment.

Do today's children have a shorter life expectancy than their parents?,"['Overweight leads to a higher rate of premature deaths – which reduces life expectancy on average by 3 to 9 months.', 'So it would be a reversal of the trend: for the first time in a long time, children would have a life expectancy less than their parents.', 'There are some reasons to assume that it will be worse than the 3 to 9 months less: Obesity is becoming more common and occurs in increasingly younger children [1].', 'If this trend continues, there may be a reduction in life expectancy of three to five years.']",0,"The claim is not directly supported by the sentences, as they discuss a potential reduction in life expectancy due to obesity, but do not provide concrete evidence that today's children already have a shorter life expectancy than their parents.","Obesity and physical inactivity are increasing risk factors worldwide that can shorten life. In 2005, a study from the USA concluded that life expectancy could be reduced by 3 to 9 months when these risks were included."
Do rising temperatures and CO2 levels increase the risk of pollen allergy?,"['It is unclear whether the increase in CO2 has already caused a noticeable increase in the amount of pollen released.', 'Influence on allergy risk unclear However, whether the increasing pollen exposure also increases the risk of developing pollen allergy for non-allergic agents is unclear.', 'Whether higher levels of pollen increase the probability of hay fever is so far unclear [5].', 'There is nothing to read about pollen becoming more aggressive in so far published studies.']",1,"While there is evidence of increased pollen exposure due to rising temperatures and CO2 levels, it remains unclear whether this leads to a higher risk of developing pollen allergy, according to the provided sentences.","Rising temperatures and increased CO2 concentrations cause plants to produce larger amounts of pollen over a longer period of time. However, it is unclear whether larger amounts of pollen and a longer pollen season increase the likelihood of developing pollen allergy."
Does training on vibration platforms cause a noticeable buildup of muscle strength?,"['Therefore, training on vibration platforms could actually strengthen the muscle strength of the leg muscles.', 'However, compared to conventional strengthening training, the results do not indicate superiority of vibration platforms.', 'According to the results of this study, it could be concluded at most that training on a vibration platform in combination with a diet can lead to weight loss, which could also be achieved by a conventional fitness program or a mere diet without exercise program.']",0,"While training on vibration platforms may strengthen leg muscles to some extent, it does not show superiority over conventional strengthening training and can only contribute to weight loss when combined with a diet, which can also be achieved through conventional fitness programs or diets without exercise.","Vibration training may be helpful for building muscle strength in the legs, but it is not better than conventional training for this purpose. Whether the method is also suitable for weight reduction has not been sufficiently studied."
Does glucosamine prolong life?,"['This is exactly what happens once again in the article on glucosamine as a life prolonger: The study was conducted on nematodes (fade worms) and mice and in which glucosamine led to an extended life span [1].', 'The conclusion of the researchers: If glucosamine has the same effect in two different species and these processes are also conceivable in humans, then glucosamine is highly likely to prolong life expectancy in humans.', 'Yes, with many limitations There is a cohort study on humans on this question: In 2010, a first evaluation looked at the influence of 20 vitamins or dietary supplements on life expectancy [3]; of these 20 only glucosamine and chondroitin showed a possible relationship with life expectancy.', 'The researchers speculate that glucosamine prolongs life expectancy just as was found in aspirin [2].', 'Until then, the life-prolonging effect of glucosamine remains optimistic speculation with little evidence.']",0,"While some studies suggest a possible relationship between glucosamine and extended lifespan in nematodes, mice, and humans, the evidence is limited, and the life-prolonging effect in humans remains speculative.","Although research here is still in its infancy and there is only one cohort study in humans besides basic studies, this shows possible effects. Further studies with better methods and other groups of participants are necessary."
Does Kinesio tape help in the treatment of joint and muscle injuries?,"['Therefore, it cannot be said whether the tape could contribute to the improvement of the pain after a long period of time.', 'Overall, the efficacy of Kinesio tape in musculoskeletal pain and injuries is at best unclear.', 'Since no studies have been carried out for more than 6 days, however, nothing can be said about a possible longer-term effect of the tape.']",1,"While some studies on Kinesio tape's effectiveness in musculoskeletal pain and injuries have been conducted, their duration was limited to 6 days or less, leaving uncertainty about any potential long-term effects, which aligns with the claim of unclear efficacy.",There is no evidence that kinesio tape can reduce pain within a few days. It is unclear whether taping can help improve movement restrictions caused by an injury.
Do injections with Botulinum Toxin A (Botox®) help with urinary incontinence?,"['According to the standard, Botulinum Toxin A (known as Botox®) has been approved in Ireland and possibly other European countries for the treatment of incontinence caused by multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injuries.', 'Efficacy of Botulinum Toxin A A summary of the results of 19 randomised-controlled studies, each with a relatively small number of participants, shows good efficacy [1].', ""Therefore, a single series of injections with Botulinum Toxin A in the bladder's detrusor muscle can significantly reduce the frequency of urinary loss in patients with incontinence.""]",0,"The claim is supported by the sentences as Botulinum Toxin A (Botox®) has been approved in Ireland and possibly other European countries for treating incontinence caused by multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injuries, and multiple studies show its good efficacy in reducing the frequency of urinary loss.","Several small randomized-controlled trials show that injections of botulinum toxin A into the detrusor muscle surrounding the urinary bladder can reduce, but not completely prevent, the incidence of involuntary urinary leakage."
Can apigenin reduce cancer risk or prevent cancer progression?,"['On the other hand, a laboratory study [5] found that apigenin might inhibit the effect of chemotherapy treatments.', 'However, when treated with apigenin, the cancer cells became resistant to this drug and did not die.', 'Apigenine without influence on cancer risk What applies in small cases could also apply in large cases.', 'This showed that those participants who had eaten the most apigenine with food were not less likely to have cancer than other women in the study.', 'Unefficacious and possibly risky Apart from laboratory findings, previous observational studies show that the potential protective effect of apigenin is not able to significantly reduce the risk of cancer in normal diets [8].']",2,"While some laboratory studies suggest apigenin might inhibit chemotherapy effects and cause resistance in cancer cells, observational studies show no significant reduction in cancer risk with normal dietary intake.","Studies suggest that even high levels of apigenin in food do not protect against cancer. In individual cases, it is suspected that apigenin in high amounts could weaken the effect of chemotherapy or even accelerate cancer growth."
Do generic drugs work as well as original drugs?,"['Results & Interpretation In a review of 7 individual studies [1] published in 2010, three active substances against epilepsy were compared with generic drugs, with no evidence of an increased probability of seizures.', 'For none of the active substances studied, there was evidence of a lower efficacy of the generic medicinal product.', 'Based on the studies published so far, there is no evidence of inferiority of generic medicinal products compared to original medicinal products.']",0,"The review of seven studies in 2010 found no increased probability of seizures with generic drugs and no evidence of lower efficacy compared to original drugs for three active substances against epilepsy, providing support for the claim that generic drugs work as well as original drugs.","Yes, the summarized results of clinical studies do not provide any evidence for a poorer efficacy of generics compared to originator drugs. However, comparative studies exist only for some agents against cardiovascular diseases and epilepsy."
Are animal-assisted therapies effective for mental illness?,"['The authors conclude from the data that animal assisted therapies may be effective in some diseases, including mental disorders and behavioural disorders such as depression, schizophrenia and addiction.', 'There is still no reliable data on the efficacy of animal-based therapy, for example in patients with cancer and advanced fatal diseases, in terms of state of health and quality of life.']",0,"While the first sentence supports the claim that animal-assisted therapies may be effective for mental and behavioral disorders like depression, schizophrenia, and addiction, the second sentence indicates a lack of reliable data for their efficacy in patients with cancer and advanced fatal diseases, leaving the claim's applicability to these conditions uncertain.","Studies on the effects of animal-assisted therapies are only partially conclusive. It seems plausible that animal-assisted therapies can be supportive for some mental illnesses; however, very large or rapid effects are unlikely."
Can lack of sleep cause obesity?,"['So, most likely, lack of sleep is just one of many different factors that can affect weight gain.', 'Cause unclear The mere fact that people with a lack of sleep are more likely to be overweight or gain more weight than those who sleep, however, does not necessarily mean that the lack of sleep is the real cause of obesity.', 'People who sleep too little usually have an unhealthy lifestyle in general, so other factors can also play a role in increasing weight gain.', ""Whether lack of sleep actually makes you fat can't be said from previous study results – even if there is evidence that people who sleep little may become overweight rather than people with normal sleep.""]",1,"While there is a correlation between lack of sleep and obesity, the sentences suggest that it may be part of a larger unhealthy lifestyle pattern, and the causality between sleep deprivation and weight gain is not definitively established by previous studies.",People who regularly get too little sleep may be more likely to be overweight than those who get enough sleep. But whether lack of sleep itself causes obesity is unclear.
Does copper intake increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease?,"[""Because there are no studies that associate an increased uptake of copper directly with an increased Alzheimer's risk [6].""]",1,"The claim that copper intake increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease is not supported, as there are no studies directly linking increased copper uptake with an increased Alzheimer's risk.",Some studies claim to have found links between high copper levels and Alzheimer's disease. Whether copper intake actually has an impact on Alzheimer's risk is not clear.
Do air ions cause an improvement of asthma??,"['Compared to asthma patients who were exposed to dummy treatment, actual therapy with air ionization devices did not show any improvement in asthma symptoms or lung function.']",2,"The claim that air ions cause an improvement of asthma is not supported by the provided sentences, as a study found no difference in asthma symptoms or lung function between patients exposed to air ionization devices and those who received a dummy treatment.","Whether ionized air can reduce allergic symptoms is unclear, as no studies exist on this question. Air ionization devices do not appear to be effective against asthma in general."
Do smoking bans lead to fewer preterm births?,"['Smoking bans mean that mothers smoke less in pregnancy and that unborn women are exposed to less passive smoke.', 'It is a methodically very good work, but there are some limitations to the statements: the results of the individual studies vary greatly, whether the real effect is really 10% each, will only be able to clarify future studies.']",0,"The claim is supported to some extent by the first sentence, indicating that smoking bans could lead to fewer preterm births due to reduced smoking and passive smoke exposure for pregnant mothers, but the second sentence suggests variability in the results of individual studies, leaving room for future clarification.","A large review shows a 10% reduced risk of preterm birth. Due to some limitations, the evidence is nevertheless low, further studies from different countries will probably soon bring clarity."
Do special garments with the active ingredient Liporeductyl help against cellulite?,"['An effect could not be found for any active substance [1].', 'Or, to put it more carefully, for none of the innumerable forms of treatment have well-derived scientific evidence that speaks for effectiveness.']",1,"The claim that special garments with Liporeductyl help against cellulite is not supported by the provided sentences, which state that no active substance, including Liporeductyl, has been found to have an effect on cellulite, and no form of treatment for cellulite has well-derived scientific evidence of effectiveness.","There are only small studies that neither stand up to methodological criteria nor have been scientifically published. Sustained efficacy has not been proven, which, according to the current status, applies to all common remedies against cellulite."
Does alcohol in moderate amounts prolong life?,"['Alcohol: Beyond good and evil As described in our article on red wine, moderate alcohol consumption probably has a positive effect on cardiovascular health [2]; moderate means an alcoholic drink per day – a small beer or an eighth of wine.']",0,"Moderate alcohol consumption, as defined in the article, may potentially benefit cardiovascular health, which could indirectly contribute to a longer lifespan, providing a rationale for the claim.","In moderate amounts, alcohol could reduce the likelihood of dying prematurely. In higher doses, however, it clearly increases this risk. This is unclear for caffeine."
Does light freezing help with weight loss?,"['Much speculation, little knowledge A scientific work taken up by many media does not help with this question [1].', 'Nevertheless, weight loss was not significantly higher than after the same exercise program at more pleasant temperatures.']",1,"The claim that light freezing helps with weight loss is not supported by the provided sentences, as a scientific study found no significant difference in weight loss between exercise at cold temperatures and more pleasant ones.","Some laboratory studies show that the body reacts to colder temperatures with higher energy consumption and burns more fat. Nevertheless, it is completely unclear whether this supports weight loss; that is, whether the process is strong enough and whether other mechanisms do not work against it. Weight loss through freezing has not been investigated in clinical studies."
Does acupuncture help against hay fever?,"['As with other acupuncture studies, it is therefore questionable whether the improvement of hay fever symptoms was due to the needle stitches themselves.', 'In order to distinguish between the placebo effect and the specific effect of acupuncture in the future, further studies with better study designs are necessary.']",1,"The improvement of hay fever symptoms may not be directly attributable to acupuncture itself, as other factors such as placebo effect could also be involved, requiring further studies with improved designs to distinguish between the two.",We have not found any meaningful studies that can provide evidence of improvement in hay fever.
"Does the ""Rolfing"" treatment cause an improvement of body malpositions as well as certain pains?","['Therefore, it cannot be automatically deduced from these results that the cause of the pain reduction lies in the Rolfing treatments.', 'Overall, the scientific evidence on the effectiveness of Rolfing technology for the treatment of pain or correction of body malpositions is insufficient.']",1,"The claim that Rolfing treatment causes improvement of body malpositions and pain is not definitively supported by the provided sentences, which indicate that the scientific evidence is insufficient and pain reduction may not necessarily be a result of Rolfing treatments.","The few studies on ""Rolfing"" are too inconclusive to answer the question."
Does marijuana use reduce the risk of developing diabetes?,"['Marijuana users have rare diabetes A cross-sectional study in 2012 of 10,896 US-Americans [2] revealed that marijuana consumers were less likely to suffer from diabetes.', 'However, they cannot show with certainty that the use of marijuana is actually responsible for the reduced risk of diabetes.', 'Marijuana may reduce risk factors The authors of a smaller cross-sectional study in 4657 subjects [3] found a connection between smoking marijuana and the reduced occurrence of insulin resistance, a precursor of diabetes.', 'People who regularly consumed marijuana had a 12 percent lower chance of developing insulin resistance.']",0,"The 2012 cross-sectional study of 10,896 US-Americans suggests a link between marijuana use and lower diabetes occurrence, but it does not establish causality, and a smaller study connects marijuana smoking to reduced insulin resistance, a diabetes precursor.",Two cross-sectional studies provide evidence for a diabetes-preventive effect of active ingredients from the cannabis plant. That the consumption of marijuana actually reduces the risk of diabetes has yet to be confirmed by extensive studies.
Does virgin conception exist?,"['Until now, fertilization without sexual contact – biologists refer to it as parthenogenesis – is only known from a few animal species.', 'In humans, the phenomenon is hardly researched, the present study is the only scientific study on this subject so far.']",1,"The claim of virgin conception in humans is not supported by the sentences, as parthenogenesis, or fertilization without sexual contact, has only been observed in a few animal species and human research on this topic is extremely limited.","To date, only one study has been conducted on this issue. The scientific evidence based on this study does not allow a clear answer."
Are movement exercises useful for back pain?,"['Targeted exercise to strengthen torso muscles should both relieve and prevent back pain.', 'As a systematic overview [1] shows, strengthening exercises can clearly prevent the recurrence of pain.', 'One of the results: Chronic cross pain (duration over twelve weeks) improves at least something when the sufferers perform regular exercise.']",0,"The sentences provide support for the claim that movement exercises are useful for back pain, as they suggest exercises can relieve, prevent recurrence, and improve chronic cross pain.","Exercise reduces the risk of getting back pain again and can relieve chronic back pain somewhat. However, quick relief from acute pain is not to be expected."
Does UV light reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease?,"['The result: 20 minutes under artificial UVA light may reduce blood pressure slightly in the short term.', 'Whether regular UVA irradiation can also reduce blood pressure in the long term cannot be predicted from this, longer-term studies would be necessary.', 'Cardiovascular diseases vs. cancer Overall, the evidence for reducing the heart risk from sunbathing is still insufficient – only more extensive and more precise studies can give an answer.']",1,"The first sentence supports a potential short-term reduction in blood pressure with UVA light exposure, but the claim is about cardiovascular disease risk, which requires long-term evidence, as indicated in the second sentence.","It is theoretically conceivable that UVB light could reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. However, studies published so far cannot sufficiently confirm this assumption."
"Is the Gynefix® contraceptive necklace as effective for contraception as the birth control pill or the ""IUD""?","['Result According to a systematic review by Cochrane Collaboration (O-Brien & Marfleet, 2008), the prevention effectiveness of the 6-member Gynefix® smelting chain is comparable to that of the copper-holding intrauterine pessar (Spirale) TCu380 or TCu380A (There are insufficient meaningful data available for the assessment of the smaller 4-member fetter).', 'In both cases – with an old and a new insertion device for the contraceptive chain – there is no significant difference between the spiral group and the Gynefix® group.', 'There is therefore no significant difference between copper spiral and contraceptive chains in both studies.']",0,"The claim is supported by the first sentence, which states that the prevention effectiveness of the Gynefix® contraceptive necklace is comparable to that of the copper-holding intrauterine pessary, and the second and third sentences, which indicate no significant difference between the spiral group and the Gynefix® group in both studies.","The 6-link copper-containing contraceptive necklace Gynefix® is comparable in contraceptive effectiveness to other copper-containing intrauterine devices (""IUDs"").

Is there an increased risk of long-term effects on the unborn child with chemotherapy starting in the 2nd trimester of pregnancy?,"['Chemotherapy in pregnancy with possible effects Chemotherapy in pregnancy is in principle a risk to the unborn because of the toxic properties of cytostatic agents.', 'However, compared to healthy peers, more children of chemotherapy-treated mothers showed mild abnormalities of heartbeat.', 'A study [ 2 ], in which the children were accompanied for an average of over three years, found that the newborns who were exposed to chemotherapy from the second trimester of pregnancy were on average 200 grams lighter than children of cancer-sick mothers without chemotherapy treatment.', 'Conclusion The likelihood of a high accumulation of severe malformations or severe long-term effects for children who were exposed to chemotherapy from the second trimester of pregnancy appears to be low.']",0,"While chemotherapy in pregnancy poses risks due to toxic cytostatic agents and can result in mild heartbeat abnormalities and lower birth weight in newborns exposed from the second trimester, severe long-term effects or high accumulation of malformations seems unlikely.","Studies published to date do not suggest a greatly increased risk of adverse effects on the child, but such a risk cannot be ruled out."
Does removal and examination of the first lymph nodes after the prostate is affected by cancer (sentinel lymph nodes or sentinel lymph nodes) improve the chances of cure? (Reader Inquiry),"['In 2010, the claim that removal and examination of the guardian lymph nodes can reduce the risk of further metastases in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Another series of cases involving a little over 1000 patients [ 2 ] showed that in about two thirds of prostate cancer cases nodes were found infected with the guardian lymph node examination, which would have been disregarded at a conventional removal of most surrounding lymph nodes.']",1,The first sentence supports the claim by stating that removal and examination of sentinel lymph nodes can reduce the risk of further metastases in patients with prostate cancer.,"Removal and examination of sentinel lymph nodes helps assess the progression of prostate cancer. However, whether it improves the chances of cure cannot be said due to the low level of scientific evidence."
Can a treatment with singing bowls relieve pain?,"['The participants felt much more relaxed, calmer and better tuned both after the treatment and after the sham treatment.', 'An effect is therefore attributable solely to the placebo effect.']",2,"The first sentence indicates a positive response to both the treatment and the sham treatment, suggesting that any perceived pain relief may be due to the placebo effect mentioned in the second sentence, which contradicts the claim of specific pain relief from singing bowls.",Singing bowl therapy does not appear to be effective for relieving pain.
Does religion promote mental health?,"['Nevertheless, the question is far from clear, for which there are a number of reasons: Hardly any significance religion, religiosity and spirituality can be distinguished from each other and also very difficult to measure.', 'It is almost impossible to bring together the results of the individual studies and, subsequently, the survey work.', 'The term ""religion"" is simply too comprehensive to be judged as a single factor.']",1,"The distinction and measurement difficulties among religion, religiosity, and spirituality, as well as the comprehensive nature of the term ""religion,"" make it challenging to decisively claim that religion promotes mental health.","The studies do not allow any conclusion to be drawn for several reasons: the results are contradictory, only a few studies are by independent authors, and religion is not a concept that is measured uniformly; neither effects nor side effects can be clearly attributed to the factor ""religion"" because there is no such thing as a uniform factor ""religion."""
Do braces treatments have preventive medical benefits in addition to aesthetic ones?,"['At present, it is not yet possible to assess all the health consequences of dental regulation, neither the positive nor the negative.', 'The result was somewhat devastating for orthodontics: no studies were found to investigate long-term efficacy, nor any that dealt with general oral health: ""Whether remedying tooth defects is an effective prerequisite for maintaining natural toothing cannot be answered,"" says the summary.', 'It is not clear when there is a need for regulation at all (""research is almost completely lacking""), nor how the risk of caries or the breakdown of the tooth root are affected.', 'Adverse reactions and long-term consequences are therefore far too little researched.', 'There is no indication of a risk from regulation, nor that dental regulation can prevent or treat diseases of the jaw joints [7] [8].']",1,"While braces treatments may have aesthetic benefits, there is currently insufficient research to conclusively determine preventive medical benefits or effects on general oral health, caries risk, or jaw joint diseases, as stated in the provided sentences.","The long-term effects of tooth straightening are still very poorly researched.

Can an anti-oxidant such as pseudocatalase stop or reverse hair graying?,['Whether pseudocatalase can return its colour to gray hair due to age (which only appear grey but are actually white) has not been investigated.'],1,"The claim that an antioxidant like pseudocatalase can stop or reverse hair graying due to age is not directly supported by the provided sentence, as it states that the potential of pseudocatalase to restore color to gray hair has not been investigated.",This question has not yet been scientifically investigated and therefore cannot be answered.
Does transcranial direct current stimulation help against severe depression?,"['tDCS therefore shows little success in the treatment of severe depression.', 'While the effect of tDCS is unclear, a number of active substances and psychotherapeutic procedures have been shown to be effective in the treatment of severe depression.']",1,"The first sentence directly refutes the claim by stating that tDCS shows little success in treating severe depression, while the second sentence does not provide clear evidence for or against the claim.","A brand new review shows that tDCS does not lead to lasting improvement in patients with major depression, nor is the response to therapy better than to placebo treatment. However, the number of participants, both overall and in the individual studies, is too low for a reliable assessment."
Is the success of conventional treatment of a herniated disc equivalent to that of disc surgery?,"['The pain was shown to decrease faster after surgery than with conventional treatment methods.', 'Intervertebral disc surgery is also much more expensive than conventional therapy.', 'However, the scientific evidence that operations do not bring an advantage in the long term compared to conventional treatment methods is low, as there are few studies of high quality.']",0,"While surgery may result in faster pain reduction initially, there is limited scientific evidence supporting long-term advantages over conventional treatment methods, which are less expensive.","Disc surgery leads to faster pain relief in the short term, but in most cases is unlikely to bring any long-term benefit compared to conventional therapy.

Does increased time outdoors inhibit myopia in children?,"['In most of these studies [ 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11 ], various research groups discovered a connection between the extent of shortsightedness and the time spent by children and adolescents in closed spaces rather than outdoors.', 'In two studies [ 8, 9 ] there was also no connection between increased outdoor activity and reduced short-sightedness.']",0,"While many studies suggest a link between less time outdoors and increased myopia in children, two studies found no connection between increased outdoor activity and reduced shortsightedness, leaving the claim partially unsupported.","There is probably a correlation between reduced myopia and outdoor activities. However, it is not possible to say beyond doubt whether increased time spent outdoors is actually the cause of reduced myopia. Various other factors also play a role in the development of myopia."
Do household cleaners and room fresheners in spray form cause damage to the heart?,"['Risk to the heart little investigated The impact of detergents or household sprays on the cardiovascular system has so far been little investigated.', 'In particular, there was a strong correlation between abnormal heart rhythm and the use of fresh cleaning and space sprays, while the regular use of other perfumed household products was not accompanied by an unusual pattern of heartbeat.', 'Whether household sprays can directly increase the risk for cardiovascular diseases, however, cannot be derived from this with certainty.', 'Conclusion Whether household cleaners can affect heart health is not yet certain, a study that not only investigates ECG abnormalities but also the actual incidence of cardiovascular diseases after regular household cleaner use would be necessary.']",1,"While a correlation between abnormal heart rhythms and the use of certain household sprays is noted, the data does not conclusively establish that household cleaners directly increase the risk for cardiovascular diseases.","There is evidence that people who often use household sprays more often have asymptomatic abnormalities of the heart rhythm. However, whether these abnormalities will later lead to disease, and whether household sprays are actually the cause, remains to be determined by larger and longer studies.

Can stress promote dementia?,"['However, according to the Internet magazine Vorarlberg Online, stress is also the most common reason for the emergence of dementia.', 'However, studies suggest that permanent performance pressure as one of many factors could be partly responsible for the development of age dementia [1] [2] [3] [4].', 'This suggests that the subjectively perceived stress level is more decisive for the risk of dementia than the actual workload.', ""Diabetes, depression, elevated cholesterol levels and smoking are among the factors that could also favour Alzheimer's disease [6].""]",0,"The claim is partially supported by the sentences, as studies suggest that chronic performance pressure and subjectively perceived stress levels could contribute to the development of dementia, although other factors like diabetes, depression, high cholesterol, and smoking may also play a role.","There is evidence that chronic stress in work and private life may increase the risk of dementia in old age. However, this needs to be confirmed by larger studies. However, stress is only one of many possible influences."

Do milk or dairy products promote colon cancer and rectal cancer?,"['For ovarian cancer, breast cancer and cancer of the uterine mucosa, the authors of extensive systematic reviews have so far found no evidence of a reduction in risk or an increase in risk [3] [4] [5].', 'However, the study situation is still too unclear to draw definitive conclusions, which requires more and more meaningful studies.', 'There is also the possibility that dairy products will reduce the likelihood of bladder cancer.']",2,"The claim that milk or dairy products promote colon cancer and rectal cancer is not directly addressed in the provided sentences, which discuss breast, ovarian, uterine, and bladder cancers.","It is likely that dairy products reduce the risk of colon and rectal cancer, and possibly bladder cancer. However, very large amounts of milk & dairy products could possibly increase the risk of prostate cancer. It should be remembered that about the same number of men die from colon and rectal cancer as from prostate cancer. For breast and ovarian cancer and cancer of the endometrium, it is unclear whether cancer risk is affected by milk and dairy products."
Does yoga change the genetic makeup?,"['The genes themselves remain unchanged, only their activity fluctuates; just as in each cell the activity of the different genes is adjusted according to current needs.', 'The difference between a liver cell and a muscle cell is not due to different genes, but to different gene activity.', 'The study shows that shortly after the activity, the gene activity differs from certain white blood cells in these two groups.']",1,"The claim is supported by the sentences, as they explain how yoga can influence gene activity without altering the genes themselves, similar to how different cell types have varying gene activity.",Yoga - like any other physical activity - can influence the activity of genes. But the genes themselves are not changed by it.
Which of the three most common laser eye surgeries produces the best results and has the fewest side effects?,"['However, the study situation is still rather thin, new and large studies could still change somewhat in this assessment.', 'At present, all three methods lead to very good results, which, according to the first long-term studies [3], are likely to be sustainable.', 'Results from a few years ago are no longer meaningful today because the treatment method has changed.', 'Long-term studies therefore always refer to the state of the art at that time, but already suggest that laser treatments are safe and sustainable [1] [2] [3].']",0,"While current long-term studies indicate that all three laser eye surgeries lead to safe and sustainable results, the claim of one method being superior with fewer side effects cannot be supported, as the study situation is still evolving and treatment methods have changed over time.","If only new studies are considered, all three techniques are equally successful. Probable advantages of LASIK: less pain after surgery and good vision more quickly."
"Can electromagnetic fields with a specific pattern (pulsed electromagnetic fields, PEMF) heal injuries?","['Evidence that this pattern in particular has a good therapeutic effect has not been provided.', 'In fact, only a randomized-controlled study on fatigue in multiple sclerosis (MS) [1] and some laboratory results can be found.', 'Apart from the fact that a study on fatigue in a particular disease naturally does not say anything about effects on completely different symptoms, this one study is not yet meaningful: there were very few participants (37) and the intake of medications differed in the experimental and control groups.', 'Many approaches, little evidence Even if the whole variety of similar treatments is considered, there are not enough good studies to prove an effect of PEMF therapies.', 'For a meaningful assessment of PEMF as a form of therapy, studies with good methodology, a higher number of participants and a comparison of the different forms of application (among others) are missing.']",1,"While a single study on fatigue in multiple sclerosis exists and some laboratory results are available, the claim lacks substantial evidence as the study had a small sample size, differing medication intake between groups, and did not address other symptoms or forms of application.","No good injury studies can be found on the device. The only randomized-controlled study treats fatigue in patients with the incurable nerve disease multiple sclerosis and is not very conclusive. Even for the whole range of similar treatment methods, there is no sufficient evidence of efficacy."
Does the drug fingolimod reduce the progression of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis similarly or better than previous drugs?,"['The recently newly approved active substance Fingolimod in Europe causes white blood cells (T cells) to be held back in the lymph nodes, which prevents them from causing inflammation by immigrating to the brain.', 'By means of systematic literature research, we wanted to find out whether fingolimod is similar to or better than previous multiple sclerosis – drugs can inhibit the progression of the disease.']",0,"The first sentence supports the claim by explaining how fingolimod works to reduce inflammation in multiple sclerosis, but the second sentence only mentions the purpose of the literature research without providing any results regarding the comparison with previous drugs.","Two manufacturer-funded clinical trials attest Fingolimod such efficacy that exceeds that of interferon beta therapy. However, the drug can also cause serious side effects."
Can cancer be successfully fought with intentionally induced fever?,"['==References== In the 19th century, the idea was born that fevers protect against cancer.', 'No major modern studies have been conducted in which deliberately triggered fever has been tested as therapy.']",1,"While the concept of fever as a protective measure against cancer originated in the 19th century, there is a lack of modern studies investigating deliberately triggered fever as therapy, leaving insufficient evidence to support or refute the claim.","In the early 20th century, cancer was indeed sometimes fought with fever, sometimes successfully. But the therapies and trials are poorly documented and were risky. An assessment of efficacy is not possible based on the studies to date."
Can some forms of headache be successfully treated with heat?,"['Accordingly, there is no scientific evidence of the effectiveness of this measure.', 'However, there is no sufficient evidence to support this claim.', 'A Cochrane overview work from 2004 [1] investigates all non-invasive physical treatment methods for all forms of headache: Heat treatment plays only a very small role according to this study (dryer is not mentioned) – heat was tested in combination with other measures: In one study, the combination of heat, home training and stretching is worse than a combination of biofeedback and relaxation.']",1,"While a Cochrane overview from 2004 investigated non-invasive physical treatment methods for all headache forms and found heat to play a minor role, there is no scientific evidence or sufficient support specifically demonstrating the effectiveness of heat treatment for headaches.","Heat on tense muscles is pleasant, but no evidence exists that the tension is released and the headache is relieved."
Does electro-acupuncture on the ear help against pain?,"['Thus, the repeated electrical irritation of acupuncture points on the ear seems to be able to stop some chronic neck or cross pain [ 2, 3 ].', 'The pain could not be brought to total disappearance, but the study participants needed less painkillers than without electro-acupuncture over the duration of a few weeks.', 'Acupuncture on the ear probably effective against pain Overall, different acupuncture methods on the ear may effectively reduce pain.']",0,"The claim is partially supported by the sentences, as they suggest a reduction in pain and need for painkillers with electro-acupuncture on the ear, but total disappearance of pain was not achieved.","Electro-ear acupuncture could be supportive against chronic pain such as neck or low back pain. The method cannot completely replace painkillers. For surgery-related pain, the effectiveness is uncertain."
Does treatment with the new drug erenumab reduce the number of migraine days per month?,"['In other words, compared to a sham medication, individuals with episodic migraines were spared on average 1 to 2 migraine days per month by erenumab [1-4].', 'So far no serious side effects The side effects of erenumab – as far as the earlier rather shorter studies at least – do not seem to be serious: those who used erenumab complained a little more frequently than those with the dummy medication about injection site reactions, constipation, muscle cramps and itching [6].', 'Because erenumab has so far only been compared with placebo.', 'No long-term data The results on efficacy and safety first sound as if people with a similar condition as in the studies could actually benefit from erenumab.']",0,"The claim is supported by the first sentence, which states that individuals with episodic migraines experienced fewer migraine days per month when treated with erenumab compared to a sham medication.","In five studies available to date, which tend to be shorter, participants suffered from migraine less frequently with erenumab than with a placebo. The studies were of high methodological quality. In episodic migraine, people ""saved"" about 1 to 2 migraine days per month . For chronic migraine, sufferers had about 2.5 fewer days of pain per month. However, the efficacy and safety data relate to a maximum time frame of six months; the long-term benefit still needs to be explored. The benefit of erenumab compared to other established preventive migraine drugs has also not yet been researched."
Is screening by optical coherence tomography superior to conventional examinations for the early detection of diabetic macular edema?,"['Early detection: Optical coherence tomography unreliable Most diabetes patients with such pathological retinal damage will not notice symptoms such as dark spots in the field of vision or impairment of sharp vision long after the start.', 'However, laser treatment is not without risk, in some cases it may also result in an unwanted reduction in vision or other side effects that affect vision.']",2,"The claim is refuted by the first sentence, which states that optical coherence tomography is unreliable for early detection of diabetic macular edema, as most patients will not notice symptoms until after the start of pathological retinal damage.","No, screening by optical coherence tomography alone is too inaccurate. An examination using an ophthalmoscope and pupil dilating eye drops or with the help of fundus photography is a safer method."
Does the treatment of diabetes-related retinal diseases by injection of VEGF inhibitors provide an advantage compared to conventional laser treatment?,"['The majority (5 out of 100 inhabitants) suffer from type 2 diabetes (formerly also called age diabetes), which is practically always lifestyle-related and in most cases is accompanied by overweight, one-sided diet and lack of exercise [ 4 ].', 'The presentation of the effectiveness of VEGF inhibitor injections as a new treatment method is also clearly exaggerated and biased – the newspaper article does not inform about risks and uncertainties.']",0,"The claim that VEGF inhibitor injections provide an advantage over conventional laser treatment for diabetes-related retinal diseases is not directly supported or refuted by the sentences, as they discuss the prevalence of type 2 diabetes and the bias in presenting the effectiveness of VEGF inhibitor injections without mentioning comparative risks or uncertainties.","There is evidence of better short-term efficacy for VEGF inhibitor injections compared with laser coagulation, but the method is insufficiently studied. Whether the effect is safe in the long term and effective at the same time is unclear."
