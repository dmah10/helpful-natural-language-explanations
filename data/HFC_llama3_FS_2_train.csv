Does paxlovid protect unvaccinated people with risk factors from severe or even fatal covid 19 disease?,"['Patients at risk without corona vaccination appear to be well protected from serious to fatal events by Paxlovid.', 'However, it is not certain how well Paxlovid helps people who have already received corona vaccination.', 'In addition, the scientists investigated whether Paxlovid alleviated the Covid-19 symptoms, shortened the duration of the disease and reduced the need for medical treatment: Half of the participants improved the symptoms with Paxlovid after 13 days, with placebo after 15 days.', 'With Paxlovid, 14 out of 1000 participants needed medical treatment for Covid-19 within a month, with placebo 76 out of 1000.', 'Whether with or without antibodies in the blood, Paxlovid basically protected all humans from a severe course.']",0,"The claim that Paxlovid protects unvaccinated people with risk factors from severe or even fatal Covid-19 disease is supported by the finding that Paxlovid basically protected all humans from a severe course, regardless of the presence of antibodies in the blood.","In a large, well-done study, paxlovid prevented hospitalizations and deaths in high-risk patients. They were unvaccinated and had contracted the delta variant. For vaccinated people, the benefit cannot be reliably estimated. This also applies to people with immunodeficiency."
Does the consumption of soy foods or soy isoflavones affect the appearance of acne skin?,"['In both cases, certain soya ingredients are responsible for the effect on the skin: the isoflavones.', 'There are two competing theories that contradict each other: according to the first theory, isoflavones confuse the hormone balance and are supposed to promote acne in this way.', 'Surprisingly, despite searching in two large databases, we could not find a study on soy products and acne – whether soy milk, soy sauce or tofu.', 'The isoflavones improved the skin appearance more than an anti-acne cream with vitamin A acid (Tretinoin).', 'Conclusion: There is currently no evidence from reliable studies that soy makes acne worse.']",1,"The claim that soy consumption affects acne skin is uncertain due to the lack of reliable studies on the topic, despite some theories suggesting isoflavones may impact hormone balance and skin appearance.","We could not find any meaningful studies at all on the influence of soy foods on acne. On soy isoflavones, we found two small studies of questionable quality that examined a very specific group of sufferers. Soy isoflavones improved the skin appearance somewhat. However, this result is not reliable."
Is the homeopathic remedy Neradin effective for erectile dysfunction?,"['No studies on Neradin Also our search for studies on the product Neradin remained resultless.', 'Studies on the product Neradin also appear to be missing.']",1,The claim that Neradin is effective for erectile dysfunction lacks supporting evidence as no studies on the product's effectiveness have been found.,"The extract from the Damiana plant (Turnera diffusa) is advertised as a remedy for erectile dysfunction for men. However, this claimed effect on potency is by no means proven. It has apparently never been tested on humans. This also applies to homeopathic remedies such as the product Neradin."
Does regular HPV testing in addition to the recommended Pap smear detect more precancerous lesions than just the Pap smear alone?,"['According to the studies, the HPV test is likely to detect slightly more precursors of cervical cancer over several years than the PAP swab alone.', 'We are therefore relatively sure that with an additional HPV test at least a little more precursors of uterine cancer are detected than only with the PAP swab alone.']",0,The claim that regular HPV testing in addition to the recommended Pap smear detects more precancerous lesions than just the Pap smear alone is supported by studies suggesting that the HPV test is likely to detect slightly more precursors of cervical cancer over time than the Pap smear alone.,"Regular examination of the cervix by means of PAP smear tests detects precancerous stages of the cervix in most cases in good time. This reduces the risk of developing cervical cancer. An additional HPV test every three to five years can make screening even more reliable. However, the difference should not be too great."
Can monk's pepper reduce PMS symptoms? PMS is the abbreviation for premenstrual syndrome. This refers to complaints that occur in the days before menstruation.,"['Reference to efficacy in PMS According to previous studies, monk peppers could actually help in PMS.', 'The summarized study results indicate that the symptoms with monk pepper are reduced in more patients than with a sham medication (placebo).', 'Therefore, it would be possible for monk peppers to act against PMS symptoms such as breast spacing.']",0,"The claim that monk's pepper can reduce PMS symptoms is supported by previous studies indicating that monk pepper reduces symptoms in more patients than a placebo, suggesting its potential to alleviate symptoms such as breast tenderness.","In the studies to date, monk's pepper seems to relieve PMS symptoms better than a placebo. However, this is not well proven, because the studies have significant weaknesses. There is no evidence of an effect on menstrual disorders. Significant studies are lacking."
Can olive leaf extract reduce high blood pressure?,"['These studies therefore do not indicate whether olive leaf extract can help with significantly increased blood pressure.', 'Without success, however, we could not find any studies that investigated the effect of olive leaf extract on cardiovascular health.', 'However, they cannot provide clear answers.', 'It is therefore impossible to say whether olive leaves extract could have a better or worse effect with significantly increased blood pressure.']",1,"The available studies do not provide conclusive evidence to determine whether olive leaf extract can help reduce high blood pressure, as they do not investigate its effect on cardiovascular health.","Whether olive leaf extract lowers blood pressure has been investigated in five suitable studies to date. They all found no effect or only a slight effect of the extract. The problem with this is that most of the study participants had only slightly elevated blood pressure. They cannot answer how olive leaf extract works in people with significantly elevated blood pressure (hypertension). The studies also had gross flaws, few participants, and ran for a very short time. They cannot provide reliable answers."
Do green-lipped mussel preparations improve the symptoms of osteoarthritis?,"['Studies overall not meaningful The conclusion of our research: Scientific evidence for the claimed effect is missing.', 'It is also unclear whether the measured positive effects are large enough to actually be felt by those affected.', 'Whether or not green-lipped mussel helps with osteoarthritis cannot be said at the moment.', 'However, as early as 2009, the European Food Safety Authority considered that a protective effect of the green-lipped mussel on healthy joints has not been established.', 'In our opinion, no reliable conclusions can be drawn from the studies found.']",1,"The claim that green-lipped mussel preparations improve osteoarthritis symptoms lacks conclusive evidence, as existing studies are deemed unconvincing and their results are unclear or unreliable.","The question was examined in four small studies with serious methodological deficiencies, which also arrived at partly contradictory results. No clear conclusions can be drawn from them. The claim that green-lipped mussel helps with osteoarthritis is not scientifically proven."
Can probiotics lower blood sugar in type 2 diabetes?,"['And if so, can probiotics reverse this change and reduce blood sugar levels again?', 'At the most small effect, they may actually be able to.', 'However, the effect of the capsules and tablets does not seem to be large: in the previous studies, they were able to reduce the long-term sugar level HbA1c by an average of 0.55 points.']",0,"While probiotics may have a small effect in reducing blood sugar levels, the impact is limited, as seen in previous studies where they only lowered HbA1c levels by an average of 0.55 points.","The summarized results of studies to date suggest that probiotics in capsule or tablet form could lower blood sugar somewhat. At least if they are taken over a period of two to three months. However, the effect is not well established. Probiotic dairy products and probiotic powder for dissolving do not seem to have any demonstrable effect."
Can the so-called Tupler technique help against rectus diastasis?,"['No studies on the Tupler technique As intense as we were looking for, we could not find the promised studies on the Tupler technique.', 'The claim that this is a scientifically proven therapy for rectus diastase is therefore simply wrong.', 'The studies in detail We did not find any studies that investigated the effectiveness of the Tupler technique for the treatment of rectus diastase.']",1,The claim that the Tupler technique is a scientifically proven therapy for rectus diastase is unsubstantiated due to the lack of studies investigating its effectiveness for this condition.,We could not find a single study that examined whether the Tupler technique actually works. And this despite the fact that providers of the method advertise that its effectiveness is scientifically proven.
Can CBD (cannabidiol) help with migraines or other headaches?,"['Apparently, CBD has never been investigated to see if it can help with migraine seizures.', 'The claim that CBD would help with migraines or headaches is pure speculation.', 'The studies in detail Despite extensive search in three databases, we could not find any studies on CBD against migraine or other types of headache, neither for treatment nor for prevention.']",1,"There is currently no scientific evidence to support the claim that CBD can help with migraines or other headaches, as no studies have been conducted to investigate its effectiveness for treatment or prevention.",There are no studies that have investigated the effectiveness of CBD against migraine. So claims that CBD can help with or prevent migraine attacks have no scientific basis. The same is true for other types of headache.
Can laser irradiation of blood by infusion needle (hemolaser treatment) relieve discomfort or help with diseases?,"['It is also unclear by what mechanism blood irradiation with bundled red light – i.e.', 'red laser – should improve health.', 'Although the authors of the three studies found [1-3] claim to have established a clear efficacy of haemolaser treatment, none of the three studies is suitable to prove this.']",1,The claim that hemolaser treatment can relieve discomfort or help with diseases is uncertain because the mechanism behind its supposed benefits is unclear and existing studies are insufficient to prove its efficacy.,There is no scientific evidence that hemolaser treatment has a palliative or curative effect on health problems.
Can CBD help with period pain?,"['Because despite searching in three different databases we could not find a single study on CBD in case of regular pain.', 'Scientifically, it is not sufficiently researched whether CBD actually promotes sleep, as providers claim.', 'The studies in detail We could not find any studies that investigated whether CBD can help with normal pain – neither for treatment nor for prevention.']",1,"The claim that CBD helps with period pain lacks concrete evidence, as no studies have been found to investigate its effectiveness in treating or preventing normal pain.",Whether CBD can relieve menstrual pain has apparently never been scientifically studied. We could not find any studies on this. Women who suffer from severe period pain should talk to a gynecologist about it. Diseases such as endometriosis could be behind it.
"Can a bioresonance device like ""Bioscan"" or ""Vieva Vital Analyser"" measure mineral and vitamin deficiencies or detect health problems?","['This experiment clearly shows that the devices studied are completely unsuitable to diagnose a lack of vitamins or minerals.', 'Sentenced for fraud at the end of May 2022, a German court also concluded that the Bioscan device cannot fulfil the claimed claims.', 'Claims for comparable products are equally implausible.', 'Even if 1000 subjects had participated in the study and only five to six people had shown such unreliable readings, such a device would be worthless for diagnostics.']",2,"The claim that bioresonance devices like ""Bioscan"" or ""Vieva Vital Analyser"" can measure mineral and vitamin deficiencies or detect health problems is refuted by experimental evidence and a German court's conclusion that such devices are unsuitable for diagnostics.","An experiment shows that the devices cannot distinguish between healthy people, seriously ill people and a corpse. The claimed mode of action behind the measurement method is also scientifically implausible. A German court has convicted the manufacturers of the Bioscan device (not legally binding) of fraud."
Does arthroscopy (joint endoscopy) help with osteoarthritis of the knee joint?,"['What might sound logical, however, has a catch: the arthroscopy of osteoarthritis does nothing to the treated person.', 'Studies clearly speak against a benefit A research team summarized the most meaningful of all previously published studies on arthroscopy in knee arthritis.', 'In these studies, patients treated after arthroscopy had no noticeably less pain or movement restrictions than those treated only for appearance or not at all.', 'Arthroscopy against osteoarthritis: not effective, but also not very risky After all: Undesirable events were not conspicuously common in the arthroscopy groups either.']",2,The claim that arthroscopy helps with osteoarthritis of the knee joint is contradicted by multiple studies that found no significant difference in pain or movement restrictions between patients who underwent arthroscopy and those who did not.,The data are clear: Arthroscopy is useless as a treatment for knee osteoarthritis. It can neither relieve pain nor improve the function of the knee joint in the long term.
"Do dietary supplements containing silicon (e.g. as ""organic silicon"" or silica) have health benefits?","['So far it is also completely unclear what role the element silicon plays in the human body at all [8].', 'We have researched: Previous studies do not provide any evidence that dietary supplements with silicon support bone build-up and thus protect older women from osteoporosis and bone fractures in old age [1,2].', 'There is no evidence that silicon improves the hair structure [3,4], strengthens the fingernails [4] or makes the skin more beautiful and elastic [4,6,7].', 'Also that silicon supports the formation of collagen and connective tissue is only a conjecture [8].', 'Conjectures without studies Neither we nor the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) [8] were able to find clinical studies on any other alleged health benefits of silicon.']",1,"The claim that dietary supplements containing silicon have health benefits is not supported by existing evidence, as previous studies have found no link between silicon supplements and benefits such as bone build-up, hair structure, fingernail strength, or skin elasticity, and no clinical studies have been found to support other alleged health benefits.","There is no evidence so far that the additional intake of silicon can promote health. Also that it strengthens nails, skin and hair is an unsubstantiated claim. Moreover, it is unclear whether silicon plays any role at all in the body."
Can regular intake of cranberry juice or cranberry extract prevent recurrent cystitis in women?,"['The summarized results show that the regular intake of cranberry products could have a preventive effect.', 'There is also only evidence that cranberry products can prevent bladder inflammation for otherwise healthy women.', 'Overall, there is evidence of a possible preventive effect of cranberry.']",0,"The claim that regular intake of cranberry juice or cranberry extract can prevent recurrent cystitis in women is supported by evidence suggesting a possible preventive effect, particularly in healthy women.","Women who repeatedly have to deal with bladder infections might become ill somewhat less frequently if they regularly take cranberry juice or extract. However, this is not well established. And it only applies to uncomplicated bladder infections in otherwise healthy women. Whether cranberry products help when cystitis is already present remains unclear. This has not yet been investigated in meaningful studies."
Will women who have recurrent bladder infections get rid of them faster if they take cranberry products only after the disease is already there???,"['There is also only evidence that cranberry products can prevent bladder inflammation for otherwise healthy women.', 'However, there does not seem to be any meaningful studies that have investigated this in women with recurrent bladder inflammation.', 'The preventive effect of cranberry in children, men and people with urinary catheters or certain diseases has not been studied.']",1,"The claim that cranberry products can help women with recurrent bladder infections recover faster is not supported by existing studies, which have only investigated the preventive effect of cranberry in healthy women.","Women who repeatedly have to deal with bladder infections might become ill somewhat less frequently if they regularly take cranberry juice or extract.

Can extract from St. John's wort relieve the symptoms of depression? Is it similarly effective as drugs against depression (antidepressants)?,"[""St John's wort: effective in mild to moderate depression Probably yes."", ""In mild to moderate depression, St John's wort preparations probably work better than placebo."", ""St John's wort preparations are probably as good as antidepressants."", ""St. John's wort and antidepressants can relieve the discomfort, but the depression can probably not cure for good.""]",0,"The claim that St. John's wort can relieve symptoms of depression is supported by evidence suggesting its probable effectiveness in mild to moderate depression, with some studies indicating it may be as good as antidepressants in providing relief.",St. John's wort is likely to relieve the symptoms of mild to moderate depression better than a placebo. It also appears to be similarly effective to approved medications for depression (antidepressants). St. John's wort preparations are generally better tolerated than antidepressants.
"Does the Zisano bracelet strengthen the immune system, increase endurance and performance or reduce fatigue?","['Whether such bracelets have an effect, for example whether they can actually increase physical performance or strengthen the immune system, has apparently never been investigated.', 'Bracelets for more performance: studies show ineffectiveness All five studies came to the same conclusion: the bracelets had no effect on the performance or well-being of the subjects.', 'A scientifically plausible explanation as to how exactly such bracelets should develop their effect remains to be found in their suppliers.', 'The studies in detail We could not find any studies on the Zisano bracelet or comparable bracelets with silicon chip.']",1,"The claim that the Zisano bracelet strengthens the immune system, increases endurance and performance, or reduces fatigue is not supported by scientific evidence, as multiple studies have found no effect on performance or well-being, and no plausible explanation for its supposed benefits has been found.","The promised positive effects of the ""Powerband"" wristband on health and well-being have apparently not been scientifically studied. We could not find any studies on this. It is also unclear how the wristband is supposed to work in concrete terms. A scientifically plausible explanation is missing."
"Does microimmunotherapy improve symptoms of allergies, cancer, joint inflammation, autoimmune diseases, dementia or various viral infections?","['None of these studies are meaningful – because they are poorly carried out and the published data are incomplete.', 'They cannot give any indication of the benefits of microimmune therapy.', 'Entitled doubts Since microimmune therapy preparations are highly diluted as homeopathic agents, we have fundamental doubts about the method.']",1,The claim that microimmunotherapy improves symptoms of various diseases is doubtful due to the poor quality of existing studies and fundamental concerns about the method's underlying principles.,"So far, studies seem to exist only on microimmunotherapy against hay fever and cancer. Their significance is far too low to conclude that the therapy is effective. We found no studies on other health problems. Thus, there is no proven benefit of microimmunotherapy for any disease."
Can ginkgo extract improve mental performance in dementia patients?,"['Dementia patients taking Ginkgo extract often seemed to perform better in thinking, memory, and concentration tasks than those who swallowed placebo preparations without an active substance [1.3].', 'Although the studies indicate that Ginkgo extract can help people with dementia, the significance of the individual studies is limited.']",0,"While individual studies suggest that ginkgo extract may improve mental performance in dementia patients, the overall significance of these findings is limited.",Previous studies suggest that ginkgo extract can improve mental performance in dementia - but this is not well established.

Does pine wood improve sleep?,"['So there is no indication that the pine wood improves sleep.', 'The importance of these laboratory measurements for the sleep of the participants is unclear – even if the researchers interpret them as positive effects of the circling bed.', 'Whether a pine bed actually improves sleep would have to study more rigorous studies carried out according to scientific criteria on significantly more subjects in the future.The studies in detail [1,2] Grote et al.']",1,The claim that pine wood improves sleep is uncertain due to the lack of rigorous scientific studies and unclear interpretations of existing laboratory measurements.,"So far, only one small study has investigated this question. However, the results of this study are not conclusive due to numerous deficiencies in the conduct of the study."
Do green-lipped mussel preparations improve the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis?,"['For us, therefore, this claim is not credible.', 'Whether green-lipped mussel helps with rheumatism or not, can therefore not be said for sure at the moment.', 'Whether the results can be transferred to other products or other dosages is unclear.', ""The studies are all badly done according to today's standard: so it is unclear how reliable the measurements of the treatment success are."", 'Whether rheumatism patients would still benefit from green-lipped mussel preparations remains unclear.']",1,"The claim that green-lipped mussel preparations improve rheumatoid arthritis symptoms is uncertain due to the poor quality of existing studies and unclear results, making it difficult to determine their effectiveness.","Five small studies provide no overall evidence of benefit from green-lipped mussel in rheumatism.

Therefore, we cannot draw any reliable conclusions from these studies."
Does covid vaccination reduce the likelihood of getting long-lasting symptoms (long covid) in case of corona infection?,"['Long-Covid risk with low vaccination Two studies [1,2] suggest that the long-covid risk is likely to be lower if vaccinated twice: In one of these studies with Corona infected [1], twice vaccinated patients reported 40 to 50 percent less likely to be affected by Long Covid compared to non-vaccinated patients.', 'Results Two-fold Vaccinated people reported to be affected by long-covid symptoms only about half as often as non-vaccinated people.']",0,The claim that covid vaccination reduces the likelihood of getting long-lasting symptoms is supported by studies suggesting that twice-vaccinated individuals are 40 to 50 percent less likely to be affected by Long Covid compared to non-vaccinated patients.,"If twice-vaccinated people are infected, their risk of later being affected by Long Covid may be only half that of non-vaccinated people. Since there is no clear definition of long covid, the protective effect cannot be precisely quantified."
Can the preventive intake of lysine prevent cold sores (lip herpes) and genital herpes? Can lysine help when the blisters are already there?,"['You cannot answer whether preventively taken lysine can prevent herpes, or whether it helps if the blisters are already there.', ""So the lysine didn't seem to have any effect."", 'Does a higher dose of lysine work better than a lower dose?', 'Results Overall, the participants had no less frequent herpes, whether they were taking high-dose lysine, low-dose lysine or placebo.', 'Results The results are ambiguous and do not allow for certain conclusions: both the Lysin group and the placebo group were less likely to have lip herpes after 6 months.']",1,"The claim that lysine can prevent or help with herpes is uncertain due to conflicting results, with some studies showing no effect on frequency of herpes and others suggesting ambiguous outcomes.",Research is coming up with inconclusive and contradictory results. All available studies are small and of unclear quality. We could not say whether lysine protects against herpes or can alleviate it.
"Do hormonal contraceptives to swallow (the ""pill"") affect endurance performance in women?","['The conclusion of the work: Women taking the pill could actually have a minor disadvantage in sports.', 'Specifically, women with a pill may absorb less oxygen during training and are out of breath faster.', 'Possibly a slightly lower performance through the pill – to this conclusion also came another current overview work [2].']",0,"The claim that hormonal contraceptives affect endurance performance in women is supported by research suggesting that women taking the pill may absorb less oxygen during training and experience faster breathlessness, potentially leading to slightly lower performance.","Taking the pill could possibly impair endurance performance in sports somewhat. However, there are no indications of less muscle strength due to the pill. However, these - somewhat contradictory - findings are anything but certain.

Is quarantining persons who have had contact with infected persons or who enter from high-risk areas an effective measure to reduce the number of COVID-19 infections and deaths?,"['In their review, the researchers concluded that quarantine should be an effective measure.', 'There is also evidence that the quarantine of returning travellers from risk areas can help to reduce the spread.', 'They support the assumption that the precautionary withdrawal of potentially infected people from public life is an important contribution to contain the pandemic.', 'Quarantine alone is too little The research team stresses, however, that even if an early and strict quarantine seems to be effective – as a sole measure to curb the current COVID-19 pandemic, it is probably not sufficient.', 'Despite the methodological weaknesses, the studies mainly point in one direction: the isolation of potentially infected persons without symptoms seems to reduce the number of cases of infection and deaths – especially at an early start and in combination with other measures such as school closures and social/physical distancing.']",0,"The quarantine of individuals who have had contact with infected persons or who enter from high-risk areas is likely to be an effective measure in reducing COVID-19 infections and deaths, especially when implemented early and in combination with other measures such as school closures and social distancing.","The analysis of 29 studies suggests that quarantine can prevent COVID-19 infections and deaths. The validity of the studies to date is diminished by the fact that only mathemathic modeling studies are available for coronavirus. However, observational studies and modeling of the related diseases SARS and MERS show much the same thing: precautionary quarantine of those who may be infected is likely to be effective, especially if the action is taken early. As a stand-alone measure, quarantine is unlikely to be sufficient to sustainably contain the pandemic."
Can homeopathic globules protect against infection with the novel coronavirus?,"['After studies on homeopathy against coronaviruses one is looking in vain.', 'Whether globuli can do anything against the new Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has never been scientifically verified.', 'Our conclusion: Based on the available scientific studies, we can currently assume that homeopathic remedies themselves have no effect.']",1,"The claim that homeopathic globules can protect against infection with the novel coronavirus is unsubstantiated by scientific evidence, as studies have found no effect of homeopathic remedies against coronaviruses or the new Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.","There is no evidence that globules can protect against the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).

On the other hand, there are individual cases of bone cancer in people treated with teriparatide - although a causal relationship cannot be clearly proven here. Systematic studies of people treated with teriparatide could not provide clear results. Since bone cancer is a very rare disease, its risk factors are difficult to pin down in studies."
Can therapy with EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) alleviate the symptoms of people with post-traumatic stress disorder?,"['Probably effective Our research revealed that people with post-traumatic stress disorder are probably better off after a psychotherapy with EMDR than people who have not received any psychotherapeutic treatment at all.', 'Our conclusion With EMDR therapy, post-traumatic stress disorder is likely to improve more than completely without therapy.', 'That they are effective has been shown in well conducted studies [1].Studies in detail Since the 1990s, the topic of trauma therapy has been intensively researched using EMDR.', 'The result: with EMDR therapy, the subjects had less complaints than without any treatment.']",0,The claim that EMDR therapy can alleviate symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder is supported by research studies that show a significant improvement in symptoms with EMDR treatment compared to no treatment at all.,Therapy with EMDR is probably more effective than no therapy at all for people suffering from the psychological consequences of a traumatic experience.

"Does daily flossing protect against tooth decay, periodontitis and tooth loss?","['Study situation not sufficient for dental floss recommendation Although prayer mill-like repeated, the effectiveness of dental floss for dental health has in fact hardly been studied more closely so far.', 'It is therefore not clear whether floss actually results in rare caries, gum inflammation or periodontitis or if the teeth are preserved longer.', 'Whether the additional effort is worthwhile for people with healthy teeth and intact gums remains as open as the question of to what extent floss can help with severe inflammation of the gums.', 'In fact, there is evidence that the correct cleaning technique with floss could be decisive for the success and avoidance of side effects: The lateral tooth surfaces should therefore be freed from tooth coverings by careful up-and-down movements [1] [2] [5].', 'The studies so far do not really help: because they have observed too few people over too short periods of time and are partly of poor quality, they do not provide sufficient basis for the general recommendation to use floss every day and from childhood onwards.']",1,"The claim that daily flossing protects against tooth decay, periodontitis, and tooth loss is uncertain due to the lack of sufficient and high-quality studies that demonstrate its effectiveness.","It is possible that regular flossing of the interdental spaces can help with mild gingivitis. However, there are no good studies that investigate whether this has a preventive effect against inflammation in healthy gums. The effect on the development of plaque is unclear. There are no studies at all on the question of whether flossing leads to fewer cavities, periodontitis or tooth loss."
Does music therapy promote recovery from severe limitations of consciousness after severe brain injury?,"['Effects of music therapy too little investigated In a detailed literature research, we have only been able to promote few relevant investigations to the surface.', 'None of the studies found involved music as a single treatment for severe brain damage and unconsciousness.', 'Most studies have had very few patients, have serious methodological deficiencies and do not answer the question whether the patients actually achieve significant and long-term improvements in consciousness through treatment.', 'This makes it unclear whether the results are transferable to people who have been in a wake-up coma or minimal state of consciousness for a long time.', 'In addition, it is unclear whether the results of the study can also be transferred to other forms of treatment such as playing familiar pieces of music.']",1,"The available research on music therapy for severe brain injury is limited and plagued by methodological flaws, making it unclear whether music therapy can promote recovery from severe limitations of consciousness.","We have not found any high-quality studies that specifically investigate the effect of music therapy. Some scientists explored the influence of stimulation of the senses, in which acoustic stimuli are also used. However, since these studies followed only a few people over short periods of time and had many methodological problems, they do not allow us to draw any firm conclusions."
Can eating grapefruit in combination with some medications lead to harmful interactions?,"['A whole range of different medicines should be able to have serious health consequences in combination with grapefruits – either as fruit or as juice.', '85 medicines have been found, the effect of which may be influenced by the consumption of grapefruits.', 'A list of medicines for which severe side effects have been observed or suspected in combination with grapefruit can be found at the end of this article.', 'In some cases, the consumption of a single fruit or a glass of grapefruit juice appears to be sufficient, in other cases harmful overdoses were observed only after days or weeks of regular consumption.', 'The thrombosis-promoting effect of ethinylestradiol, a main active substance of conventional contraceptive pills, is increased by grapefruits.']",0,"The claim that eating grapefruit in combination with some medications can lead to harmful interactions is supported by the fact that numerous medicines have been found to be affected by grapefruit consumption, with some interactions resulting in severe side effects.","Yes, grapefruits can enhance the effects of some medications.

Is Bulletproof Coffee recommended?,"['Conclusion Published studies with human subjects who have dealt with the subject of Bulletproof Coffee are not available.', 'It also lacks the basis to make statements about side effects and long-term safety of this food form.', 'Thus it should not be quite easy to make various effects dingfest.', 'Ingredients under the microscope We have not found any clinical studies on the effects of Bulletproof Coffee.', 'However, there are still various unexplained aspects around these references.']",1,The claim that Bulletproof Coffee is recommended is questionable since there are no published studies with human subjects to support its effects and long-term safety.,"Bulletproof coffee is high in caffeine and fat. Is the hip breakfast substitute a kind of fitness potion? Or is it even harmful? Because there have been no studies on this coffee blend with human test subjects, we cannot make any reliable statements."
Do apples help with smoking cessation?,"['However, it is open which ingredients of apples should take the pleasure of tormenting – scientific evidence for this claim is missing.', 'However, apples do not appear in this context and in evidence-based recommendations [a], at least not as an aid.', 'However, the effects are small, and whether the apple taste is responsible can only be speculated.', 'On the other hand, it is not researched whether the apple really takes the appetite for the cigarette.']",1,"The claim that apples help with smoking cessation lacks concrete scientific evidence, and while some effects are observed, it is unclear whether the apple itself is responsible for these effects.",Apples contain numerous ingredients and rightly have the reputation of being a healthy snack. Whether they can help to give up cigarettes has not yet been investigated in studies.
Do products made from fenugreek seeds help you lose weight?,"['However, the results do not indicate that an extract of plant seeds could help to reduce weight.', 'It is therefore unclear whether fenugreek seeds are able to lower blood sugar both in the short term and over longer periods of time.', 'Therefore, it remains unclear to what extent fenugreek seeds can be helpful in weight loss.', 'Whether the Fenulife product helps with weight loss can by no means be demonstrated by a study carried out for only three days.', 'The result is sobering: no meaningful studies of high quality were found.']",1,The claim that products made from fenugreek seeds help with weight loss is uncertain due to the lack of high-quality studies and unclear results from existing research.,"We found only one study in which participants had not lost weight after six weeks. However, the study period is very short, the number of participants small and the quality mediocre. It therefore remains unclear whether fenugreek seeds can help lose weight in the longer term."
Does skipping breakfast increase heart attack risk?,"['Obviously, therefore, the main reason for the increased risk of heart attacks was not to skip the morning meal, but overweight, diabetes, increased blood pressure, or too high cholesterol levels.', 'Thus, it is unclear whether the omission of breakfast leads to overweight or excess weight leads to the omission of breakfast.']",1,"The claim that skipping breakfast increases heart attack risk is uncertain because the relationship between breakfast omission and heart attacks may be influenced by underlying factors such as overweight, diabetes, and high cholesterol levels.","There is no clear evidence that not eating breakfast could be a cause of obesity and, as a consequence, an increased risk of heart attack. It is possible, however, that it is primarily those people who are overweight and have a higher heart risk who forgo their morning meal."
Does wheat make you fat and sick?,"['But even if all of these mechanisms were correctly described, this does not necessarily mean that wheat makes you sick – the interplay of all mechanisms is not known.', 'Thus, the reduction of excess weight leads to health improvements, not the elimination of wheat.']",1,"The claim that wheat makes you fat and sick is challenged by the uncertainty of the interplay between mechanisms and the fact that weight reduction, not wheat elimination, leads to health improvements.",There is no evidence in current studies that wheat has a special connection with obesity and its consequences. Attributing a special role to wheat seems implausible.
Do whole grains lower the likelihood of dying early?,"['Against cancer, heart problems and diabetes The current study situation shows something else: Those who frequently resort to whole grains get less cancer or cardiovascular diseases, for example a heart attack [1–4].', 'Thus, people in whom whole grains play a major role in their daily diet seem to live longer and healthier.', 'All four summaries come to the same conclusion: They show a clear correlation between a full-grain diet and a reduced chance of dying early.', 'At least as far as the reduced risk of disease is concerned, the data show a robust dose-effect relationship: the more whole grains are eaten, the lower the risk of disease [6].']",0,"The claim that whole grains lower the likelihood of dying early is supported by the consistent correlation found in multiple studies, which show that a diet rich in whole grains is associated with a reduced risk of diseases and a longer, healthier life.",People who eat whole grain products instead of foods made from refined flour are likely to live longer and probably have a lower risk of dying from cancer or cardiovascular disease.
"Does the consumption of dairy products promote mucus and diseases of the ear, nose and throat?","['No correlation between milk consumption and laboratory values The results of studies published so far in a systematic review do not indicate that high milk consumption increases inflammation levels in the blood.', ""However, the fact that the long-standing popular belief that cow's milk has a smearing effect is not likely to be confirmed by this, according to current knowledge.""]",1,"The claim that dairy products promote mucus and diseases of the ear, nose, and throat is not supported by current scientific knowledge, as high milk consumption has not been shown to increase inflammation levels in the blood.",There is no scientific evidence to prove that cow's milk causes mucus.
Do light drinks promote obesity?,"['However, the fact that sweeteners actually affect blood sugar and insulin levels has not been proven.', 'The largest work, a summary analysis of three studies involving a total of 125,000 participants [7], comes to the opposite conclusion – light drinks should therefore reduce the weight slightly.', 'No scientific evidence whether artificially sweetened lemonades promote the development of overweight is therefore not yet available.']",1,"The claim that light drinks promote obesity is uncertain due to conflicting findings, with some research suggesting they may even lead to weight reduction, while the impact of sweeteners on blood sugar and insulin levels remains unproven.","Several cohort studies show that people who frequently drink light drinks are more likely to be overweight. However, this does not prove that sweetener drinks make you fat. For it is equally conceivable that overweight people try to lose weight with light drinks. Whether they are successful in doing so is unclear."
Does coffee reduce the risk of dementia?,"['Scientists from Finland even want to find out that regular coffee drinking may also keep the brain fresh in the long term, in which it protects against dementia [1] [2].', 'And in fact, the scientists were able to establish a positive connection, but this effect seems to be above all a question of the coffee dose: the mental decline occurred most rarely during the course of the study in people who drank an average of one or two cups a day.', 'From the data from a total of eleven individual studies, the scientists concluded that people who consume a lot of caffeine had a reduced risk of dementia by about one-sixth (16%).', 'Further studies are necessary There are indications that people who drink a moderate amount of coffee daily are less at risk of developing cognitive disorders in the long term.']",0,"The claim that coffee reduces the risk of dementia is supported by studies suggesting a positive connection between moderate coffee consumption and a lower risk of dementia, with an optimal daily dose of one or two cups.",One to two cups of coffee a day may protect against mental decline in the long term. It should not be more than that. It is unclear where this effect comes from and whether other caffeinated beverages might also be protective.
Does sugar consumption increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes regardless of obesity?,"['Soft drinks increase the risk of diabetes People with a preference for large amounts of sugar-containing sodas also suffer more frequently from diabetes.', 'In their analyses, two research teams [1,2] were able to independently show that the more sugar the study participants consume in the form of soft drinks, the higher the probability of developing type 2 diabetes.', 'It seems that daily consumption of sugared soft drinks can trigger diabetes over many years even if it does not make you fat.', 'Sugar content of other foods with unclear influence The association with type 2 diabetes is relatively clear for soft drinks.']",0,"The claim that sugar consumption increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes regardless of obesity is supported by the findings that daily consumption of sugared soft drinks can trigger diabetes over many years, even if it does not lead to obesity.","Sugar-containing soft drinks can - if consumed regularly - cause obesity. Obesity, in turn, increases the likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes. However, sugared soft drinks probably also increase the risk of diabetes independently of obesity."
Does a lower salt diet reduce the likelihood of cardiovascular disease?,"['Whether the many salt in the food was really the reason for cardiovascular diseases, however, cannot be unquestionably clarified.', 'The result: a low-salt diet seems to be able to actually reduce the likelihood of cardiovascular diseases.', 'Those who reduce their salt consumption can reduce blood pressure in the medium term.', 'Lowering the risk of consequential diseases caused by high blood pressure can help a diet that is poorer in salt.']",0,"The claim that a lower salt diet reduces the likelihood of cardiovascular disease is supported by the finding that reducing salt consumption can lower blood pressure, which in turn can help prevent consequential diseases caused by high blood pressure.","A lower-salt diet has been shown to help reduce elevated blood pressure somewhat. It is possible, but not certain, that this reduces the likelihood of dying from a stroke or the consequences of narrowed heart vessels, such as a heart attack."
Is less eaten from red plates?,"['The result: The test subjects who were served their pretzels on red plates accessed significantly less than participants with blue or white plates.', 'In a second experiment, subjects also drank soft drinks in a larger amount of blue instead of red cups.', 'As logical as this explanation may sound, the study does not yet provide scientific evidence that red plates really eat less.', 'In both salty and sweet snacks, the participants gained less when they were lying on a red plate in front of them.']",0,"The claim that less is eaten from red plates is supported by the experiments where participants consumed less pretzels and snacks when served on red plates, but the underlying reason for this phenomenon is still unclear.","In two psychological experiments, participants were less likely to eat salty pretzels, popcorn or chocolate chips if they were served on red plates. It is unclear whether the effect lasts over a longer period of time."
Does red wine protect better against cardiovascular disease than white wine?,"['However, they usually did not distinguish between white and red wine [1] [2] [3].', 'It can therefore not be proven that red wine protects particularly well against cardiovascular diseases.', 'Thus, people who consume small amounts of alcohol daily seem to have a lower cardiovascular risk and live a little longer than strict non-drinkers [1] [2] [3] [4].', 'The result: For a moderate dose of eight to ten grams of pure alcohol per day, the overall mortality and risk of cardiovascular disease were lower than for non- or minor drinkers.', 'The impact of the studies is limited Even if people who eat a glass of wine or beer daily live longer and healthier, this does not necessarily mean that alcoholic beverages are responsible.']",1,"The claim that red wine protects better against cardiovascular disease than white wine is not supported by the studies, which do not distinguish between the two types of wine and instead focus on the overall moderate consumption of alcohol.","There is evidence that moderate amounts of alcohol may protect against cardiovascular disease, but the effect is not well established. Whether this possibly protective effect is stronger with red wine than with white wine or other alcoholic beverages has not been sufficiently investigated."
Do azo food dyes cause attention deficit disorder and hyperactivity in children?,"['Since 2010, the EU has committed manufacturers to label food with azo dyes ""May affect the activity and attention of children"".', 'However, the summarized results of these and other previously published studies provide clear evidence that artificial food colours can cause attention and hyperactivity disorder (ADHS).', 'Although the bright-colored dyes could be a partial cause of ADHD, there are certainly many other unknown triggers [5].', 'The studies in detail The fact that azo dyes could be responsible for behavioural abnormalities of children suggests a clean summary of previous studies [2].', 'Compared to children who continued to consume azo dyes, behavioural abnormalities decreased slightly.']",0,"The claim that azo food dyes cause attention deficit disorder and hyperactivity in children is supported by studies that suggest a link between artificial food colours and attention and hyperactivity disorder, although the exact extent of their responsibility remains unclear.",Some studies fuel the suspicion that azo dyes can exacerbate ADHD symptoms.
Does turmeric prevent or cure cancer?,"['However, well-executed studies of this kind have so far been scarce.', 'After 6 months of administration, the values did not differ between turmeric and dummy subjects.', 'This makes it unclear whether any improvement observed is due to turmeric treatment or whether the health status of the study participants would have improved without turmeric.']",1,"The claim that turmeric prevents or cures cancer is uncertain due to the scarcity of well-executed studies and the inconclusive results of existing research, which fail to demonstrate a clear difference between turmeric treatment and placebo.",Animal studies provide tentative evidence that turmeric can prevent or treat cancer. Whether turmeric has such an effect in humans cannot be assessed due to the low confidence level of a few studies conducted to date.
Does breastfeeding reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome?,"['The scientists conclude that the risk of breastfed children is halved compared to un breastfed children [2].', 'However, the matter has a small catch: the studies analysed show a connection.', 'The studies in detail The fact that breastfeeding reduces the risk of unexpected death of a baby is only moderately secure.', 'However, this does not necessarily prove that breastfeeding is the reason for the lower risk of infant death.']",0,"While the studies suggest a connection between breastfeeding and a lower risk of sudden infant death syndrome, the evidence is moderately secure and does not necessarily prove causality.","Breastfeeding can possibly reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome, but this is not entirely certain.

"Do boron preparations such as borax, boric acid, or calcium fructoborate relieve pain associated with age-related joint wear (osteoarthritis)?","['Even if their authors want to give a positive impression in their work – a critical look at the data shows that the Borax tablets could not alleviate arthrosis complaints among the participants.', 'There is no evidence that borax or boric acid can actually improve the discomfort in people with worn joints.', 'Those who suffer from chronic osteoarthritis pains and stiff joints and are hoping for relief through Borax should rely on more effective alternatives.']",1,"The claim that boron preparations relieve pain associated with age-related joint wear is not supported by evidence, as critical examination of the data reveals no alleviation of arthrosis complaints and no improvement in discomfort in people with worn joints.","The few studies on this are of poor quality and therefore not trustworthy. Moreover, there is no evidence that the human body needs boron at all."
Does the Orthopulse device accelerate the orthodontic correction of malocclusions?,"['Little meaningful The three published studies [1-3] cannot convince: None of the studies actually investigates the entire duration of treatment, but only the speed of tooth movements in the correction phase of brace therapy.', 'This does not make any sure statements about the reduction of the overall duration of treatment with which the manufacturer advertises.', 'Theoretically, two effects of orthopulses would be conceivable: positive effects if the duration of treatment were shortened, or negative effects if conversion processes at the tooth root were accelerated.', 'Thus, it is also questionable whether the faster treatment with the orthopulse device actually results from infrared therapy: In the control group, the teeth move on average by 0.44 mm per week, in the group with the orthopulse device on average by 1.27 mm per week.']",1,"The claim that the Orthopulse device accelerates orthodontic correction of malocclusions is uncertain because the existing studies only investigate the speed of tooth movements during the correction phase, not the overall treatment duration, and the faster treatment results may not necessarily be attributed to the infrared therapy.",Poorly done studies show that the device can accelerate tooth movement in the short term. Whether this reduces the overall treatment time has not yet been sufficiently proven. The methodological weaknesses of the studies also mean that the results are not very credible. Possible side effects have not yet been sufficiently investigated.
Is it harmful for the mental development of the unborn child if the mother regularly eats fish contaminated with mercury during pregnancy?,"['For previous studies suggest that the consumption of larger amounts of mercury-containing fish could slightly affect the mental performance of the offspring [1, 2, 3].', 'The studies in detail The fact that methyl mercury can damage the brain of unborn children already in concentrations in which the pregnant mothers themselves do not notice any symptoms is beyond question [6].', 'In investigations into the Faroe Islands and New Zealand, the assumption was confirmed: expectant mothers with high mercury levels were given children, whose mental performance was on average slightly worse in later tests than that of unloaded mothers – the mercury levels of the mothers were mostly so high, because they had consumed large amounts of contaminated fish before and during pregnancy.', 'Impact on the IQ Despite these contradictions, the consumption of contaminated fish seems to reduce the intelligence of the offspring measurable, although it is not yet clear how much.', ""A research team at Harvard University calculated an average reduction in the intelligence ratio of 0.7 points for each micrograms of mercury in mother's hair [2] in the analysis of studies from the Faroe Islands, Seychelles and New Zealand.""]",0,The claim that eating fish contaminated with mercury during pregnancy harms the mental development of the unborn child is supported by studies showing that high mercury levels in mothers are associated with slightly lower mental performance in their offspring.,"Many commercially available types of edible fish are contaminated with traces of methyl mercury. There are indications that regular consumption of such mercury-containing fish during pregnancy can impair the brain development of unborn children and thus their later mental abilities. In contrast, consumption of fish low in mercury could promote brain development in the unborn."
Can the consumption of caffeine during pregnancy harm the unborn child?,"['However, the study showed that it made no difference whether the participants drank around three cups of caffeine or decaffeinated coffee.', ""On average, the weight of birth at birth was about the same, was similar in size and was not more frequently born too early even after the mother's caffeine consumption."", 'Similar to the summary of the Cochrane overview work: In early pregnancy three cups of coffee daily would have no effect on birth weight, growth or premature birth [2].']",1,"The claim that caffeine consumption during pregnancy harms the unborn child is challenged by studies showing that moderate caffeine intake has no effect on birth weight, growth, or premature birth.",There is insufficient evidence that moderate consumption of caffeinated beverages would have a negative impact on the child's development. Up to three cups of coffee a day does not appear to reduce the child's birth weight. Very large amounts of caffeine-containing beverages could possibly contribute to lower birth weight.
Are vegetables prepared in a microwave oven less healthy than those prepared in other ways?,"['Recent studies see the matter more differentiated: Depending on the variety of vegetables and the exact type of preparation, the microwave can sometimes be better and sometimes worse suited than, for example, cooking [2-12].', 'In the worst case, if it is exaggerated with the duration and the number of watts, the corresponding food is less health-promoting, but in no way harmful to health.', 'If there are health problems related to the microwave, then this is not because the microwave ingredients are destroyed or changed, but because it is simply too unhealthy to eat altogether.', 'The week-long feeding with always several times warmed up in the microwave has not led to any signs of poisoning in the animals.']",2,"The claim that microwave-prepared vegetables are less healthy than those prepared in other ways is disputed, as the microwave's impact on vegetable healthiness depends on factors like cooking time, wattage, and vegetable type, and excessive use can lead to unhealthy eating habits rather than destroying or altering the ingredients themselves.","How vegetables change during preparation is extremely variable. With any type of heating, ingredients can be lost or become more easily accessible. In sum, it cannot be said that preparation in the microwave is always a bad choice."
Can fructose damage the liver?,"['Fruit sugar as a cause not proven There are no meaningful indications for the assumption that fruit sugar is responsible for the development of the liver disease [1].', 'In other words, for the liver, it may not matter what kind of sugar you eat.']",1,"The claim that fructose damages the liver is disputed as there is no conclusive evidence to suggest that fruit sugar, a type of fructose, is responsible for the development of liver disease.",There is no conclusive evidence for a possible liver-damaging effect of fructose.
Can green tea affect the likelihood of dying early and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease?,"['In fact, the summarized results of observational studies show that passionate green tea drinkers live longer on average – apparently because they are less likely to die from cardiovascular diseases such as heart attack [2,3].', ""However, a 100% proven cause-effect relationship à la ‘Green tea use protects against stroke, heart attack and co' cannot be derived from these observational studies."", 'We do not know exactly what the substances from the green tea in our body do – and what amounts can trigger a positive health effect.', 'Overall, the study data show that passionate green tea drinkers are less likely to die from cardiovascular diseases and thus live longer overall.', 'Seven RCTs are summarized here, and the authors concluded that green tea as a beverage or dietary supplement may have a beneficial influence on the risk factors of blood pressure, total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol.']",0,"While observational studies suggest that passionate green tea drinkers live longer and are less likely to die from cardiovascular diseases, the exact mechanisms and amounts of green tea required for a positive health effect are still unknown, and RCTs indicate a potential beneficial influence on risk factors such as blood pressure and cholesterol levels.","There is a lack of conclusive studies on the health effects of specific matcha. However, there is some evidence that green tea in general may reduce the likelihood of dying prematurely, especially from cardiovascular disease."
Can acupuncture prevent migraines and tension headaches?,"['Acupuncture works... From chronic migraines or tension headaches Affected patients get significantly rare headache attacks when they not only take conventional medication, but also undergo prophylactic acupuncture treatment.', '...but as good as migraine medications Another point suggests that acupuncture has a valuable prophylactic effect – at least for migraine sufferers: Further studies showed that acupuncture can only partially prevent migraine attacks, but at least as well as common medications [1].']",0,"Acupuncture appears to have a prophylactic effect on migraines and tension headaches, reducing the frequency of attacks, although its effectiveness may be comparable to conventional medications.","In the case of migraine, the preventive effect of acupuncture is probably similar to that of prophylactic medication. However, for both migraine and tension headaches, acupuncture performs only slightly better than sham acupuncture. Whether the pricking of traditional acupuncture points plays a role is unclear."
Can green tea reduce the likelihood of dying from cancer ?,"['In some studies, there was indeed a slightly reduced probability of disease, but other studies even suggested an increased risk of cancer from the use of green tea.', 'The result provides sobering clarity: people who regularly drink large amounts of green tea die in sum as often at some kind of cancer as people who hardly touch green tea [8].', 'To a degree harmless Although the benefits of green tea against cancer are questionable, there is no evidence of a health-impairing effect in moderate consumption of some cups a day [2].']",2,"While some studies suggest a possible link between green tea consumption and reduced cancer risk, the overall evidence is inconsistent and does not conclusively demonstrate that green tea can reduce the likelihood of dying from cancer.",The results of previous studies suggest that green tea cannot reduce the risk of dying from cancer.
Can plant sterols or foods with them reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease?,"['However, it is unclear whether the intake of such high amounts of plant sterols – e.g.', 'Whether these results are a coincidence or whether the higher rate of cardiovascular problems are actually due to plant sterols and not to other causes is unclear.', 'Cholesterol is also different Whether plant sterols can actually reduce not only LDL cholesterol levels, but also the risk of cardiovascular diseases, has not been investigated in a single clinical study.']",1,"The claim that plant sterols or foods with them can reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease is uncertain due to a lack of clinical studies investigating their direct impact on cardiovascular disease risk, despite their potential to lower LDL cholesterol levels.","Plant sterols do lower cholesterol levels. However, whether they also reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease has not been researched. Animal studies even provide evidence that plant sterols in large quantities could increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. Whether this also applies to humans has not been investigated."
Can too much iodine cause autoimmune thyroid disease and consequently hypothyroidism?,"['Individual studies suggest that too large amounts of iodine may be responsible.', 'Probably a variety of causes These study results suggest that Hashimoto disease is more likely to occur in people with particularly high iodine consumption.', 'However, large amounts of iodine may cause serious disturbances in people with potentially undetected thyroid problems [8].', 'The studies in detail Whether large amounts of iodine can actually cause inflammation of the thyroid gland by an overreacting immune system is not well protected.', 'The result: the higher the iodine intake in a region, the greater the proportion of residents who suffer from autoimmune thyroid inflammation.']",0,"The claim that excessive iodine consumption can lead to autoimmune thyroid disease and hypothyroidism is supported by individual studies suggesting a link between high iodine intake and increased incidence of Hashimoto disease, as well as potential disturbances in people with undetected thyroid problems.",Autoimmune thyroid disease appears to occur more frequently in individuals with high iodine consumption. Whether high levels of iodine actually cause this disease has not been conclusively determined.
Does coffee affect cancer death risk?,"['Both studies concluded that coffee consumption has no effect on cancer mortality.', 'In other words, coffee generally does not seem to favor or prevent death through cancer.', 'For breast cancer, prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer and bladder cancer there seems to be no association with the consumption of coffee.', 'Conclusion: Coffee consumption does not seem to affect cancer mortality.', 'They did not detect any influence of coffee on the number of cancer deaths.']",2,"The claim that coffee affects cancer death risk is refuted by multiple studies that found no association between coffee consumption and cancer mortality, including breast, prostate, pancreatic, and bladder cancer.",Current evidence suggests that coffee consumption in general is neither protective nor detrimental to cancer death risk.
Do diets with primarily or exclusively uncooked foods have health benefits?,"['Whether raw food followers suffer a heart attack or stroke less often, need less medication or live longer overall, can not be derived from this.', 'Conclusion A health benefit of raw food, which goes beyond an increased consumption of vegetable foods, has not been conclusively proven.', 'Rather, there are indications that strict raw food diets may also have a negative impact on health – similar to other diets that severely restrict food selection.']",1,"The claim that diets with primarily or exclusively uncooked foods have health benefits is not supported by conclusive evidence, as the available data suggests that any benefits may be due to increased vegetable consumption rather than the raw food diet itself, and may even have negative health impacts.","In studies, we have not been able to find convincing evidence that raw foods provide health benefits over healthy diets that include cooked foods.

Does the drug Sovaldi (sofosbuvir) enable high cure rates for chronic hepatitis C?,"['Studies show that the new drug significantly increases treatment success: In patients who have not received treatment before, the chances of healing are now above 90 percent according to most studies [1] [2] [3] [a].', 'The active substance of Sovaldi (sofosbuvir) is very successful in most of these patient groups, although not all groups have the same evidence [1] [2].', 'In any case, Sovaldi and other agents that directly attack the virus have revolutionized the treatment of hepatitis C and studies are currently underway to test the different combinations of drugs in different patient groups.']",0,The claim that Sovaldi enables high cure rates for chronic hepatitis C is supported by studies showing treatment success rates above 90 percent in previously untreated patients and its active substance being successful in most patient groups.,"Yes, in combination with drugs that have been available for some time, cure rates of over 90 percent are possible with sofosbuvir. However, there are many different patient groups, and success rates are not the same for all."
Does alpha lipoic acid help prevent or treat Alzheimer's disease?,"[""Thus, we do not know whether alpha lipoic acid can mitigate the disease or even protect it from Alzheimer's disease [1]."", 'Due to the few existing observational studies, they could not draw any conclusions or even make recommendations for the intake of alpha lipoic acid.', ""So we have no indication whether the intake of alpha lipoic acid by healthy people (from food, as a dietary supplement) can prevent Alzheimer's from breaking out at all.""]",1,"The available evidence does not provide conclusive insights into whether alpha lipoic acid can prevent or treat Alzheimer's disease, as existing studies are limited and do not allow for definitive conclusions or recommendations.",It remains to be seen whether alpha lipoic acid can help prevent or delay the onset of Alzheimer's disease. There is also a lack of conclusive studies on the question of the extent to which the substance can favorably influence the course of a disease that has already broken out.
Do over-the-counter cough medicines relieve cough symptoms?,"['Thus, it is impossible to know whether freely available cough medications actually help, or only facilitate the purse.', 'The authors of the review analysed studies on a wide range of active substances: cough-saturating active substances: dextrometorphan, codeine (prescription) slime-solving agents: guaifenesin, bromhexin, ambroxol Various combinations of mucosa-swelling agents and antihistamines Overall, however, the studies analysed are of mostly doubtful quality and come to contradictory results.', 'Thus, for none of these active substances authorised in Austria there is evidence of effective relief of cough symptoms.', 'Even for the prescription codein, the study contribution in acute cough is unclear [1].']",1,"The analysis of various studies on over-the-counter cough medicines reveals inconsistent and low-quality results, casting doubt on their ability to effectively relieve cough symptoms.",That over-the-counter cough medicines provide relief from acute cough is neither proven nor disproven - there are simply no studies of sufficient quality to answer this question.

Can dowsers find harmful soil zones or water veins?,"['Of three known studies in this direction, however, no supporting results are available.', 'One of these three studies was carried out according to strict scientific guidelines – it finds no connection between harmful zones and an influence on skin resistance [3].', 'In the three studies found [6] [7] [8], dowsing rodents could not find artificially laid water veins more frequently than chance allows.The results of the studies are more similar to those of a statistical random experiment – according to the motto: Every blind chicken finds a grain.', 'Furthermore, there were no large concordances of the randomly found water veins within or between the studies.']",2,"The claim that dowsers can find harmful soil zones or water veins is unsupported by scientific studies, which have consistently found no connection between dowsing and the location of water veins or harmful zones.",Small studies show that dowsing rods cannot detect water veins or hypothetical interference zones in the ground.
Does bioresonance therapy help with health complaints?,"['In this regard, the Commission refers primarily to physical opinions which allegedly show that the basic principles of bioresonance are incorrect [1], but also mentions three clinical studies which have shown ineffectiveness.', 'What to Know About Bioresonance There are no meaningful studies that certify efficacy of bioresonance, while two small clinical studies clearly speak against [7] [9].', 'The studies in detail The three studies already mentioned in the position name clearly show, on the one hand, that the method is not suitable for diagnosing allergies [8], on the other hand, they are only partly meaningful as a verification of efficacy – simply due to the low number of participants [7] [9].', 'Since 2006, some studies have been published, which allegedly speak for bioresonance, but most of them are scientifically worthless.']",2,The claim that bioresonance therapy helps with health complaints is refuted by multiple clinical studies that have shown its ineffectiveness and the lack of meaningful scientific evidence to support its efficacy.,"Good studies on the question are hard to find. Due to the lack of proof of efficacy, the risk of misdiagnosis and the lack of plausibility, professional associations have been warning against bioresonance for some time."
Do irradiations with cold red light help with chronic gingivitis?,"['Few studies, no effect The few studies published so far indicate, however, that cold red light cannot effectively relieve such inflammations [1] [2] [3].', 'The fact that cold red light is intended to reduce pain after dental surgery can also not prove previous research results [4].', 'In none of these, the participating researchers were able to find an additional benefit of cold red light irradiation for the usual periodontitis treatment.', 'The summary analysis of existing studies does not indicate that cold red light can alleviate the consequences of dental surgery.']",2,The available studies consistently indicate that cold red light irradiation does not provide any additional benefits in alleviating chronic gingivitis or reducing pain after dental surgery.,Previous studies indicate that chronic gingivitis and inflammation after dental surgery do not improve with irradiation with cold red light.
Does the Aspire system help you lose weight?,"['Whether this system leads to the desired weight loss, however, can not be said for sure at the present time.', 'However, it points to a strong effect: the study participants with the Aspire system lost an average of 21 kilograms in the first year, the comparison group only about 6 kilograms [1].', 'Patients with Aspire decreased an average of 21 kilograms in the first year, compared with about 6 kilograms in the comparative group.']",0,"The claim that the Aspire system helps with weight loss is supported by study results showing a significant average weight loss of 21 kilograms in the first year, compared to 6 kilograms in the control group.","Although there is only one small study on this, it shows a very large effect - which indicates that it is effective."
Does bisphenol A trigger allergies?,"['Hormone-like substances on the pill For BPA, the evidence of an allergy-promoting effect is currently not very strong.', 'The same study, which showed no correlation between the once measured BPA value in urine and existing allergies, found such association with the triclosan concentration in urine [2].']",1,"The evidence for bisphenol A triggering allergies is currently limited and inconclusive, as a study found no correlation between BPA levels in urine and existing allergies.","Individual observational studies suggest an association between bisphenol A intake and the development of asthma, but not allergy, in early childhood.

Can maggots accelerate the healing of chronic wounds compared to conventional treatment?,"['Although the thorough cleansing of the wound is important for the healing process [2], there seems to be no indication that wounds heal faster after the maggot treatment [1].', 'Twelve months after the start of treatment, the number of subjects with healed chronic wounds in the maggot group was no greater than in patients with hydrogel associations.']",2,"The claim that maggots accelerate the healing of chronic wounds compared to conventional treatment is challenged by the findings that thorough cleansing is important for healing, but maggot treatment does not show a significant difference in healing rates compared to other treatments like hydrogel associations.","Maggot therapy may not heal chronic wounds any faster than conventional wound care. However, the maggots seem to be able to clean the wound of dead tissue more quickly - but also cause more pain."
Do electric toothbrushes protect oral health better than manual brushes?,"['After a thorough analysis of all the results, they have come to a clear conclusion: Yes, electric toothbrushes are actually better for oral hygiene – but the difference is not large [1].', 'The electric oral cleaning thus removes a trace better than hand toothbrushes.', 'If you brush your teeth electrically, you will also get a little less gingival inflammation than people who brush manually, according to the results of the analyzed studies.', 'The advantage of electric toothbrushes compared to conventional toothbrushes is small.']",0,"The claim that electric toothbrushes protect oral health better than manual brushes is supported by studies showing a slight advantage in oral hygiene and reduced gingival inflammation, although the difference is not significant.",Electric toothbrushes probably combat plaque and bleeding gums slightly better than conventional manual toothbrushes. The type of electric brush does not seem to play a major role.
Do antidepressants from the group of serotonin reuptake inhibitors help with depression?,"['Even if not all questions have been finally clarified around the SSRI group, the current study situation has revealed the following: SSRIs are effective.', ""SSRIs are not ‘happy pills', the effects achieved are rather moderate."", 'SSRI can be helpful in severe and probably also moderate depression.', 'In fact, the study situation with SSRI, as measured by its wide spread, was rather modest over a long period of time.']",0,"The claim that antidepressants from the serotonin reuptake inhibitors group help with depression is supported by the study situation, which reveals that SSRIs are effective, albeit with moderate effects, particularly in severe and moderate depression.","Serotonin reuptake inhibitors have been shown to be helpful in more severe depression, although the exact mechanisms are not clear. Overall, very strong or rapid effects are not expected. For milder depression, efficacy is more debatable. Sometimes patients have to try several SSRI preparations until they feel an improvement in symptoms, and some sufferers are not helped by the drugs at all. Well-done studies should help clarify the situation in the future so that more targeted treatment is possible."
Is there a health risk from metal contaminants in lipsticks?,"['Risk in individual cases unclear The cited study by the team led by study leader Liu [1] analysed 32 products on their metal content.', 'The small amounts of lipstick thus do not lead to an increased risk of poisoning.', 'If the use of lipsticks is therefore a health risk when used very frequently, only more detailed and extensive studies can show.']",1,"The claim that metal contaminants in lipsticks pose a health risk is uncertain, as while small amounts of lipstick do not lead to poisoning, more frequent and extensive use may still have unknown effects.","Several chemical analyses find traces of metals in lipsticks, which can in principle be harmful in high concentrations. However, the analyses do not examine the quantities in which the metals are actually absorbed and whether they cause damage in the body. Overall, there is still too little research into whether there could be a risk for some of the metal impurities if they are used very frequently."
Can topiramate reduce the frequency of migraine attacks?,"['The authors summarized the results of 17 studies and found that the number of headaches actually decreases – but only by one in 28 days.', '[1] The overview also shows positive effects on the overall quality of life, but only to a small extent and not quite without contradiction.', 'Although all studies go in the same direction and indicate the effectiveness of topiramate, despite the review work of Cochrane Collaboration, the evidence is low, also because there are other criticisms: The authors have several conflicts of interest and it is possible that studies with poor results have not been published (publication bias).', 'Little knowledge about chronic migraine In the expert recommendation on therapy and care for chronic migraine, two small studies are mentioned, according to which topiramate can also prevent in chronic migraine attacks [2].']",0,"Topiramate appears to reduce the frequency of migraine attacks, albeit with limited evidence and potential biases, and its effectiveness in chronic migraine is still uncertain.","Possibly yes. A review by the Cochrane Collaboration attests that topiramate slightly reduces the frequency of migraine attacks in adults, and in some patients the attacks even decrease significantly. Still, there are unanswered questions and the side effects should not be underestimated."
Does particulate matter pollution increase the risk of heart attack - even if the EU limits are complied with?,"['The study of over 367,000 adults from 13 European countries indicates that long-term exposure to particulate matter generally increases the risk of mortality – meaning life-saving [1].', ""The authors reported that long-term exposure to particulate matter at the place of residence makes the occurrence of heart attack and unstable angina pectoris ('heart', a sign of an imminent heart attack) more likely."", 'An English cohort study from 2013 could not deduce a link between heart attack risk and fine dust air pollution, but fine dust exposure increased the risks of other heart diseases.', 'The short-term inhalation of larger amounts of fine dust may also make a heart attack more likely.']",0,"The claim that particulate matter pollution increases the risk of heart attack even if EU limits are complied with is supported by the study's findings that long-term exposure to particulate matter increases the risk of mortality and heart attack, despite one English cohort study failing to establish a link between heart attack risk and fine dust air pollution.","Recent studies from Europe indicate that everyday exposure to particulate matter may increase the risk of acute heart disease (myocardial infarction, angina pectoris). General mortality may also be increased already by 'allowed' long-term exposure within the current EU limits."
Are endocrine disruptors in cosmetics a health risk?,"['Thus, the risk for parabens is not demonstrated by clinical studies, especially not by cosmetics.', 'Many chemicals are not researched at all, the interaction with certain diseases is unknown and it is also not sufficiently clear when and how endocrine disruptors intervene in the physical development of adolescents [b].', 'Humans are therefore exposed to many such influences, which makes risk assessment very difficult.']",1,The claim that endocrine disruptors in cosmetics pose a health risk is uncertain due to the lack of conclusive clinical studies and the complexity of assessing risks amidst multiple influences.,"Although many cosmetics do indeed contain substances that can influence the hormone system, a health risk has not been proven. Ecological consequences, on the other hand, have already been demonstrated."
"Can a dietary supplement containing omega-3 fatty acids, lipids, vitamins, and nutrients (""Souvenaid"") noticeably slow or halt the decline of mental performance in Alzheimer's disease?","['A comparison of the test values of the product and placebo groups with the end of the study shows no noticeable difference in the memory performance of the participants.', ""Two randomised-controlled studies for six to twelve months [4] and a third randomised-controlled study for 18 months [5] show that omega-3 fat-containing fish oil capsules cannot improve mental capacity in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease."", ""Whether one can prevent or delay the outbreak of Alzheimer's disease, if one regularly eats fish oil capsules, is not sufficiently investigated [6]."", ""Those who swallow preparations containing vitamin B6, B12 and folic acid should not be able to prevent mild to mild Alzheimer's disease from progressing [6].""]",2,"The claim that Souvenaid can slow or halt the decline of mental performance in Alzheimer's disease is not supported by the evidence, as multiple randomized-controlled studies have shown that omega-3 fatty acid supplements, similar to Souvenaid, do not improve mental capacity in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.",Three randomized-controlled trials show that such a dietary supplement (Souvenaid®) is unlikely to markedly slow or halt the progression of Alzheimer's dementia. Taking omega-3 fatty acid or vitamin B supplements alone also does not appear to have such an effect.
Does meditation help against stress?,"['Stress reduction in healthy people is shown, but not whether it is actually due to treatment.', 'A new review [3] summarizes 47 studies and brings better data – even if things remain complicated: Although some forms of meditation work against stress, only in comparison to control groups that receive no other targeted treatment.', 'The authors of an overview of mindfulness-based stress reduction [4] report in their summary that this form of therapy improves mental health, both in healthy people and in some patients with mental illnesses.', 'According to the systematic review work of 2014, not all types of meditation are equally effective: for mindfulness-based meditation, an effectiveness can be demonstrated, but not for transcendental meditation, in which the concentration of attention is sought to dissolve [3].']",0,"While some forms of meditation, such as mindfulness-based meditation, have been shown to be effective in reducing stress, the evidence is not conclusive and the effectiveness of meditation against stress varies depending on the type of meditation and the control group used.","Various forms of meditation seem to be able to alleviate stress both in healthy individuals and in people with mental illness.

Does eye training help prevent myopia?,"['A systematic review did not find a controlled study in 2005 that could show an effect of eye training on shortsightedness – nor any that would suggest a preventive effect of eye training [1].', 'For other forms of falseness, there are also small and methodologically weak studies that find no difference between eye training and a control group [1].', 'But in most cases there is no evidence of the effect of visual training [1] [3].']",2,"The claim that eye training helps prevent myopia is refuted by the lack of evidence from controlled studies and systematic reviews, which consistently find no preventive effect or difference between eye training and control groups.","According to the current state of studies, an effectiveness of eye training can only be expected for very few diseases; an effect as prevention or therapy against myopia cannot be assumed at present."
Does Cryolipolysis cause noticeable body fat reduction?,"['Whether the method can effectively reduce body fat cannot be said based on its results.', 'Whether the reason for the alleged figure improvements after three to six or twelve months was actually the cold treatment, however, can not be determined by previous-after-comparisons without an untreated control group anyway.', 'Even if the authors of previously published studies conjure the effectiveness of cryolipolysis – this cannot be objectively assessed on the basis of their results.']",1,The claim that cryolipolysis causes noticeable body fat reduction is uncertain because the existing studies lack a control group and their results cannot be objectively assessed.,"The effectiveness of cryolipolysis cannot be assessed objectively, as there are no scientific efficacy studies on it."
Is acupuncture for chronic pain more effective than placebo acupuncture treatment?,"['Acupuncture slightly surpasses dummy treatment A recent study is now to show that the pain-relieving effect of acupuncture exceeds that of a mere placebo effect, several media write.', 'The very thorough analysis of all these clinical studies showed that acupuncture in chronic pain was not only better than no treatment, but also slightly better than a sham acupuncture.', 'Also in fibromyalgia, a chronic pain disorder of the musculature, acupuncture probably has a slight, but hardly noticeably better effect than sham acupuncture [9].', 'Even if the mechanism of action of acupuncture is unknown and the placebo effect is partly responsible for its analgesic effect, it appears to be an interesting alternative or additional therapy for patients with chronic pain.']",0,"The claim that acupuncture is more effective than placebo acupuncture treatment for chronic pain is supported by studies showing a slight, but noticeable, difference in pain relief between the two.","Acupuncture is slightly superior to sham acupuncture treatment for some types of pain.

Can the active ingredient acetyl salicylic acid (ASA) protect against cancer?,"['Minor reduction in cancer risk According to a recent systematic review [ 1 ], daily intake of ASA actually results in a minor reduction in cancer risk.', 'Among 1000 subjects who took ASA, 16 people died of cancer on average, while those who received only an ineffective dummy medication (placebo) were19.', 'In a cohort study over ten years, the intake of ASA only led to a reduced risk of colorectal cancer every other day, but also to increased gastrointestinal bleeding [5].']",0,"The claim that ASA protects against cancer is supported by evidence suggesting a minor reduction in cancer risk, although the extent of this protection is limited and may be specific to certain types of cancer, such as colorectal cancer.","Taking ASA daily for several years seems to be able to reduce the risk of dying from cancer somewhat. However, it increases the risk of severe internal bleeding and stomach problems."
Is tick-borne tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) much milder in children than in adults?,"['Although only 20 children participated in this study, there is a certain trend: young patients generally had less severe symptoms and recovered faster than adults.', 'Except for one case of complete vaccination and two cases of incomplete vaccination, the affected children were unvaccinated [11] and more frequently developed meningitis, while adults were more likely to fight with the more dangerous inflammation of the brain and cerebral membranes (meningo-encephalitis).']",0,"The claim that TBE is milder in children than in adults is supported by the study's findings, which suggest that children tend to experience less severe symptoms and recover faster than adults, although they may be more likely to develop meningitis.","Current studies suggest that TBE is probably associated with milder symptoms in children than in adults. Permanent damage is also less frequent in younger patients. However, TBE can also have severe health consequences in children in individual cases."

Does condom use cause depression in women?,"['Like any contraceptive method, the condom has disadvantages that it causes depression in women, but is nowhere documented.', 'Maybe less fun We have not found a study that specifically investigated whether the use of condoms in sex can lead to depression in women.', 'If condoms were to promote depression, it would be unlikely that depression would decrease if used more frequently.', 'They have found no correlations between condom use and depression [4].', 'Risk factors for depression In any case, condoms cannot be found in the list of recognised risk factors.']",1,"The claim that condom use causes depression in women is unsubstantiated as no study has found a correlation between the two, and condoms are not recognized as a risk factor for depression.",A study examining exactly this question was not found. Some scientific works with a broad question rather lead to the conclusion that there is no connection between depression and condom use.
Do rising temperatures and CO2 levels increase the risk of pollen allergy?,"['It is unclear whether the increase in CO2 has already caused a noticeable increase in the amount of pollen released.', 'Influence on allergy risk unclear However, whether the increasing pollen exposure also increases the risk of developing pollen allergy for non-allergic agents is unclear.', 'Whether higher levels of pollen increase the probability of hay fever is so far unclear [5].', 'There is nothing to read about pollen becoming more aggressive in so far published studies.']",1,"The available research suggests that while rising temperatures and CO2 levels may increase pollen exposure, it remains unclear whether this leads to a higher risk of developing pollen allergy in non-allergic individuals.","Rising temperatures and increased CO2 concentrations cause plants to produce larger amounts of pollen over a longer period of time. However, it is unclear whether larger amounts of pollen and a longer pollen season increase the likelihood of developing pollen allergy."
Does glucosamine prolong life?,"['This is exactly what happens once again in the article on glucosamine as a life prolonger: The study was conducted on nematodes (fade worms) and mice and in which glucosamine led to an extended life span [1].', 'The conclusion of the researchers: If glucosamine has the same effect in two different species and these processes are also conceivable in humans, then glucosamine is highly likely to prolong life expectancy in humans.', 'Yes, with many limitations There is a cohort study on humans on this question: In 2010, a first evaluation looked at the influence of 20 vitamins or dietary supplements on life expectancy [3]; of these 20 only glucosamine and chondroitin showed a possible relationship with life expectancy.', 'The researchers speculate that glucosamine prolongs life expectancy just as was found in aspirin [2].', 'Until then, the life-prolonging effect of glucosamine remains optimistic speculation with little evidence.']",0,"While some studies on glucosamine in nematodes, mice, and humans suggest a possible link to increased life expectancy, the evidence is limited and largely speculative, leaving the claim unsubstantiated.","Although research here is still in its infancy and there is only one cohort study in humans besides basic studies, this shows possible effects. Further studies with better methods and other groups of participants are necessary."
Does Kinesio tape help in the treatment of joint and muscle injuries?,"['Therefore, it cannot be said whether the tape could contribute to the improvement of the pain after a long period of time.', 'Overall, the efficacy of Kinesio tape in musculoskeletal pain and injuries is at best unclear.', 'Since no studies have been carried out for more than 6 days, however, nothing can be said about a possible longer-term effect of the tape.']",1,"The available evidence does not provide conclusive results on the long-term benefits of Kinesio tape in treating joint and muscle injuries, as existing studies only examine its effects for a short period of time.",There is no evidence that kinesio tape can reduce pain within a few days. It is unclear whether taping can help improve movement restrictions caused by an injury.
Do injections with Botulinum Toxin A (Botox®) help with urinary incontinence?,"['According to the standard, Botulinum Toxin A (known as Botox®) has been approved in Ireland and possibly other European countries for the treatment of incontinence caused by multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injuries.', 'Efficacy of Botulinum Toxin A A summary of the results of 19 randomised-controlled studies, each with a relatively small number of participants, shows good efficacy [1].', ""Therefore, a single series of injections with Botulinum Toxin A in the bladder's detrusor muscle can significantly reduce the frequency of urinary loss in patients with incontinence.""]",0,"The claim that injections with Botulinum Toxin A (Botox) help with urinary incontinence is supported by the approval of Botox for incontinence treatment in Ireland and other European countries, as well as the results of 19 randomised-controlled studies showing good efficacy in reducing urinary loss frequency.","Several small randomized-controlled trials show that injections of botulinum toxin A into the detrusor muscle surrounding the urinary bladder can reduce, but not completely prevent, the incidence of involuntary urinary leakage."
Can apigenin reduce cancer risk or prevent cancer progression?,"['On the other hand, a laboratory study [5] found that apigenin might inhibit the effect of chemotherapy treatments.', 'However, when treated with apigenin, the cancer cells became resistant to this drug and did not die.', 'Apigenine without influence on cancer risk What applies in small cases could also apply in large cases.', 'This showed that those participants who had eaten the most apigenine with food were not less likely to have cancer than other women in the study.', 'Unefficacious and possibly risky Apart from laboratory findings, previous observational studies show that the potential protective effect of apigenin is not able to significantly reduce the risk of cancer in normal diets [8].']",2,"The claim that apigenin can reduce cancer risk or prevent cancer progression is challenged by findings that it may inhibit chemotherapy effects, show no significant reduction in cancer risk in observational studies, and even induce cancer cell resistance to treatment.","Studies suggest that even high levels of apigenin in food do not protect against cancer. In individual cases, it is suspected that apigenin in high amounts could weaken the effect of chemotherapy or even accelerate cancer growth."
Are animal-assisted therapies effective for mental illness?,"['The authors conclude from the data that animal assisted therapies may be effective in some diseases, including mental disorders and behavioural disorders such as depression, schizophrenia and addiction.', 'There is still no reliable data on the efficacy of animal-based therapy, for example in patients with cancer and advanced fatal diseases, in terms of state of health and quality of life.']",0,"The claim that animal-assisted therapies are effective for mental illness is partially supported by the data, which suggests they may be beneficial for certain mental disorders, but more research is needed to establish their efficacy in other areas.","Studies on the effects of animal-assisted therapies are only partially conclusive. It seems plausible that animal-assisted therapies can be supportive for some mental illnesses; however, very large or rapid effects are unlikely."
Can lack of sleep cause obesity?,"['So, most likely, lack of sleep is just one of many different factors that can affect weight gain.', 'Cause unclear The mere fact that people with a lack of sleep are more likely to be overweight or gain more weight than those who sleep, however, does not necessarily mean that the lack of sleep is the real cause of obesity.', 'People who sleep too little usually have an unhealthy lifestyle in general, so other factors can also play a role in increasing weight gain.', ""Whether lack of sleep actually makes you fat can't be said from previous study results – even if there is evidence that people who sleep little may become overweight rather than people with normal sleep.""]",1,"The claim that lack of sleep causes obesity is uncertain because the correlation between sleep deprivation and weight gain may be influenced by other unhealthy lifestyle factors, making it unclear whether sleep loss is a direct cause of obesity.",People who regularly get too little sleep may be more likely to be overweight than those who get enough sleep. But whether lack of sleep itself causes obesity is unclear.
Is breaking an energy-saving lamp harmful to health?,"['[3] If an energy-saving lamp breaks, the mercury contained therein escapes, among other things, in the form of mercury vapour.', 'However, these experiments did not directly investigate whether this could lead to signs of poisoning in humans.', 'Even if the safety limit has been exceeded in some cases, mercury vapour concentrations in the ambient air did not reach levels for which a health hazard is considered probable in any study.']",1,"While breaking an energy-saving lamp may release mercury vapour, studies have not found concentrations in the ambient air to be high enough to pose a probable health hazard.","If an energy-saving lamp breaks, mercury vapor is released in quantities that can exceed the limits considered safe. Whether this can cause damage to health has not been directly investigated. However, after removal of the broken glass and good ventilation of the room, the value quickly falls back below the limit value."
Does copper intake increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease?,"[""Because there are no studies that associate an increased uptake of copper directly with an increased Alzheimer's risk [6].""]",1,"The claim that copper intake increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease is not supported by any studies that directly link the two, suggesting a lack of evidence for this association.",Some studies claim to have found links between high copper levels and Alzheimer's disease. Whether copper intake actually has an impact on Alzheimer's risk is not clear.
Do air ions cause an improvement of allergies?,['Hardly any studies on anti-allergic effects No clinical studies have been performed to date on the alleged anti-allergic effects of air ions.'],1,"The claim that air ions improve allergies lacks concrete evidence, as no clinical studies have been conducted to investigate their alleged anti-allergic effects.","Whether ionized air can reduce allergic symptoms is unclear, as no studies exist on this question.

Do air ions cause an improvement of asthma??,"['Compared to asthma patients who were exposed to dummy treatment, actual therapy with air ionization devices did not show any improvement in asthma symptoms or lung function.']",2,The claim that air ions cause an improvement of asthma is contradicted by the finding that actual therapy with air ionization devices did not show any improvement in asthma symptoms or lung function compared to dummy treatment.,"Whether ionized air can reduce allergic symptoms is unclear, as no studies exist on this question. Air ionization devices do not appear to be effective against asthma in general."
Do smoking bans lead to fewer preterm births?,"['Smoking bans mean that mothers smoke less in pregnancy and that unborn women are exposed to less passive smoke.', 'It is a methodically very good work, but there are some limitations to the statements: the results of the individual studies vary greatly, whether the real effect is really 10% each, will only be able to clarify future studies.']",0,"While the study suggests that smoking bans may lead to fewer preterm births by reducing maternal smoking and passive smoke exposure, the varying results of individual studies necessitate further research to confirm the exact impact.","A large review shows a 10% reduced risk of preterm birth. Due to some limitations, the evidence is nevertheless low, further studies from different countries will probably soon bring clarity."
Do special garments with the active ingredient Liporeductyl help against cellulite?,"['An effect could not be found for any active substance [1].', 'Or, to put it more carefully, for none of the innumerable forms of treatment have well-derived scientific evidence that speaks for effectiveness.']",1,The claim that special garments with Liporeductyl help against cellulite is unsupported as scientific evidence fails to demonstrate the effectiveness of any active substance or treatment for this purpose.,"There are only small studies that neither stand up to methodological criteria nor have been scientifically published. Sustained efficacy has not been proven, which, according to the current status, applies to all common remedies against cellulite."
Does alcohol in moderate amounts prolong life?,"['Alcohol: Beyond good and evil As described in our article on red wine, moderate alcohol consumption probably has a positive effect on cardiovascular health [2]; moderate means an alcoholic drink per day – a small beer or an eighth of wine.']",0,"The claim that moderate alcohol consumption prolongs life is supported by the suggestion that it has a positive effect on cardiovascular health, which is a key factor in overall lifespan.","In moderate amounts, alcohol could reduce the likelihood of dying prematurely. In higher doses, however, it clearly increases this risk. This is unclear for caffeine."
Does caffeine make us die sooner???,"['However, this does not yet clarify whether caffeine shortens or prolongs life.', 'This does not mean that it is caffeine that reduces the risk of mortality; it only shows that people who drink a lot of coffee differ in their risk from people who drink little coffee.', 'Why this is so and what role caffeine itself plays is not clarified – even if it could be shown by which mechanisms caffeine may have its positive effect [c].']",1,"The claim that caffeine shortens life is not supported by conclusive evidence, as the relationship between caffeine consumption and mortality risk is still unclear and may be influenced by other factors.","In moderate amounts, alcohol could reduce the likelihood of dying prematurely. In higher doses, however, it clearly increases this risk. This is unclear for caffeine."
Does light freezing help with weight loss?,"['Much speculation, little knowledge A scientific work taken up by many media does not help with this question [1].', 'Nevertheless, weight loss was not significantly higher than after the same exercise program at more pleasant temperatures.']",1,The claim that light freezing helps with weight loss is unsubstantiated as scientific research has yielded little knowledge on the topic and existing studies have not shown a significant increase in weight loss compared to exercising at more pleasant temperatures.,"Some laboratory studies show that the body reacts to colder temperatures with higher energy consumption and burns more fat. Nevertheless, it is completely unclear whether this supports weight loss; that is, whether the process is strong enough and whether other mechanisms do not work against it. Weight loss through freezing has not been investigated in clinical studies."
Does acupuncture help against hay fever?,"['As with other acupuncture studies, it is therefore questionable whether the improvement of hay fever symptoms was due to the needle stitches themselves.', 'In order to distinguish between the placebo effect and the specific effect of acupuncture in the future, further studies with better study designs are necessary.']",1,The claim that acupuncture helps against hay fever is uncertain due to the questionable impact of the needle stitches themselves and the need for further studies to distinguish between the placebo effect and the specific effect of acupuncture.,We have not found any meaningful studies that can provide evidence of improvement in hay fever.
Do earrings cause discomfort by destroying acupuncture points or meridians?,"['However, we could not find any studies that would have investigated earrings and their effects on meridians or acupuncture points.']",1,"The claim that earrings cause discomfort by destroying acupuncture points or meridians lacks evidence, as no studies have investigated the relationship between earrings and their effects on meridians or acupuncture points.","Earrings very often lead to complications, fortunately most of them are harmless. However, whether earrings can also destroy meridians or similar representation points of body regions in the auricle and thus lead to health complaints has not been investigated in studies."
"Does the ""Rolfing"" treatment cause an improvement of body malpositions as well as certain pains?","['Therefore, it cannot be automatically deduced from these results that the cause of the pain reduction lies in the Rolfing treatments.', 'Overall, the scientific evidence on the effectiveness of Rolfing technology for the treatment of pain or correction of body malpositions is insufficient.']",1,"The claim that Rolfing treatment improves body malpositions and alleviates certain pains is not conclusively supported by scientific evidence, as the existing results do not definitively link the treatment to the desired outcomes.","The few studies on ""Rolfing"" are too inconclusive to answer the question."
Does marijuana use reduce the risk of developing diabetes?,"['Marijuana users have rare diabetes A cross-sectional study in 2012 of 10,896 US-Americans [2] revealed that marijuana consumers were less likely to suffer from diabetes.', 'However, they cannot show with certainty that the use of marijuana is actually responsible for the reduced risk of diabetes.', 'Marijuana may reduce risk factors The authors of a smaller cross-sectional study in 4657 subjects [3] found a connection between smoking marijuana and the reduced occurrence of insulin resistance, a precursor of diabetes.', 'People who regularly consumed marijuana had a 12 percent lower chance of developing insulin resistance.']",0,"While some studies suggest a correlation between marijuana use and a reduced risk of diabetes, including a lower incidence of insulin resistance, the evidence does not conclusively prove that marijuana use is the direct cause of this reduced risk.",Two cross-sectional studies provide evidence for a diabetes-preventive effect of active ingredients from the cannabis plant. That the consumption of marijuana actually reduces the risk of diabetes has yet to be confirmed by extensive studies.
Do fish oil capsules promote prostate cancer?,"['[4] [5] High dose of fish oil could increase prostate cancer risk The article in the courier is based on a recently published case-control study [1].', 'The US study authors concluded that high blood levels of omega-3 fatty acids DHA, EPA and DPA are associated with a higher probability of prostate cancer.', 'Study participants with particularly large amounts of this omega-3 fat in the blood had an increased risk of prostate cancer by 43 percent compared to men with low intake of fish oil.', 'A systematic review [2] of previous studies seems to support these findings: As a result, high concentrations of the two omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA in the blood could increase the risk of high-grade prostate cancer by 39 percent (i.e.', 'The researchers can show a connection between the consumption of high doses of fish oils and the occurrence of prostate cancer.']",0,"The claim that fish oil capsules promote prostate cancer is supported by studies showing a significant increase in prostate cancer risk with high blood levels of omega-3 fatty acids, particularly DHA and EPA.","In general, there seems to be a negative effect of omega-3 fatty acids in fish oil capsules: DHA and EPA in high doses could increase the risk of prostate cancer.

Is electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) in combination with ordinary fitness training more efficient than fitness training alone?,"['However, according to a meta-analysis summarising the results of 17 studies, the effect is no greater than in conventional strengthening exercises [ 1 ].', 'Full-body EMS as a fitness method hardly investigated While the electrical stimulation of individual muscle groups for therapeutic purposes was investigated by some research groups, there are hardly any scientific studies on the whole-body EMS as a fitness training replacement.']",1,"The claim that EMS in combination with ordinary fitness training is more efficient than fitness training alone is challenged by a meta-analysis of 17 studies, which found no greater effect than conventional strengthening exercises.","There is evidence for the principle effectiveness of EMS for muscle strengthening. For a superiority of the combination of EMS and ordinary training compared to fitness training alone, the evidence is contradictory."
Can vitamin and nutrient supplements prevent the eye disease age-related macular degeneration?,"['Progress probably slows down In fact, the summarized results of previously published studies show that a combination of vitamin C, E, beta-carotene and zinc can probably maintain the increasingly deteriorating vision longer.', 'However, the fact that a vitamin mix seems to slow the progression of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is largely due to the results of a single study conducted by the US ""AREDS"" research team [1] [3].', 'This study examined a mixture of 500 mg vitamin C, 400 IU vitamin E, 15 mg beta-carotene, 80 mg zinc oxide and 2 mg copper oxide.', 'It is well established that vitamin E and beta-carotene are not suitable for prevention – they cannot prevent the ocular disease from developing in old age.']",2,"While a specific combination of vitamins and nutrients may slow down the progression of age-related macular degeneration, there is no evidence to suggest that they can prevent the disease from developing in the first place.","Vitamin E and beta-carotene cannot prevent the development of age-related macular degeneration. However, in combination with zinc and vitamin C, they probably allow certain forms of an existing disease to progress somewhat more slowly."
Do milk or dairy products promote colon cancer and rectal cancer?,"['For ovarian cancer, breast cancer and cancer of the uterine mucosa, the authors of extensive systematic reviews have so far found no evidence of a reduction in risk or an increase in risk [3] [4] [5].', 'However, the study situation is still too unclear to draw definitive conclusions, which requires more and more meaningful studies.', 'There is also the possibility that dairy products will reduce the likelihood of bladder cancer.']",2,"The provided sentences do not suggest a link between milk or dairy products and an increased risk of colon cancer and rectal cancer, and instead focus on the lack of evidence for other types of cancer.","It is likely that dairy products reduce the risk of colon and rectal cancer, and possibly bladder cancer. However, very large amounts of milk & dairy products could possibly increase the risk of prostate cancer. It should be remembered that about the same number of men die from colon and rectal cancer as from prostate cancer. For breast and ovarian cancer and cancer of the endometrium, it is unclear whether cancer risk is affected by milk and dairy products."
Which of the three most common laser eye surgeries produces the best results and has the fewest side effects?,"['However, the study situation is still rather thin, new and large studies could still change somewhat in this assessment.', 'At present, all three methods lead to very good results, which, according to the first long-term studies [3], are likely to be sustainable.', 'Results from a few years ago are no longer meaningful today because the treatment method has changed.', 'Long-term studies therefore always refer to the state of the art at that time, but already suggest that laser treatments are safe and sustainable [1] [2] [3].']",0,The claim that one laser eye surgery produces the best results with the fewest side effects is uncertain due to the evolving nature of treatment methods and the need for more long-term studies to establish a clear winner.,"If only new studies are considered, all three techniques are equally successful. Probable advantages of LASIK: less pain after surgery and good vision more quickly."
Does the drug fingolimod reduce the progression of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis similarly or better than previous drugs?,"['The recently newly approved active substance Fingolimod in Europe causes white blood cells (T cells) to be held back in the lymph nodes, which prevents them from causing inflammation by immigrating to the brain.', 'By means of systematic literature research, we wanted to find out whether fingolimod is similar to or better than previous multiple sclerosis – drugs can inhibit the progression of the disease.']",0,"The claim that fingolimod reduces the progression of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis similarly or better than previous drugs is supported by the mechanism of action of fingolimod, which prevents T cells from causing inflammation in the brain, and the systematic literature research aimed to compare its effectiveness with previous drugs.","Two manufacturer-funded clinical trials attest Fingolimod such efficacy that exceeds that of interferon beta therapy. However, the drug can also cause serious side effects."
Can cancer be successfully fought with intentionally induced fever?,"['==References== In the 19th century, the idea was born that fevers protect against cancer.', 'No major modern studies have been conducted in which deliberately triggered fever has been tested as therapy.']",1,"The claim that cancer can be successfully fought with intentionally induced fever remains unsubstantiated due to the lack of modern studies testing deliberately triggered fever as therapy, despite the historical idea that fevers may have a protective effect against cancer.","In the early 20th century, cancer was indeed sometimes fought with fever, sometimes successfully. But the therapies and trials are poorly documented and were risky. An assessment of efficacy is not possible based on the studies to date."
Does electro-acupuncture on the ear help against pain?,"['Thus, the repeated electrical irritation of acupuncture points on the ear seems to be able to stop some chronic neck or cross pain [ 2, 3 ].', 'The pain could not be brought to total disappearance, but the study participants needed less painkillers than without electro-acupuncture over the duration of a few weeks.', 'Acupuncture on the ear probably effective against pain Overall, different acupuncture methods on the ear may effectively reduce pain.']",0,"The claim that electro-acupuncture on the ear helps against pain is supported by studies suggesting that it can reduce chronic neck or cross pain, although it may not completely eliminate pain, but rather decrease the need for painkillers.","Electro-ear acupuncture could be supportive against chronic pain such as neck or low back pain. The method cannot completely replace painkillers. For surgery-related pain, the effectiveness is uncertain."
Does treatment with the new drug erenumab reduce the number of migraine days per month?,"['In other words, compared to a sham medication, individuals with episodic migraines were spared on average 1 to 2 migraine days per month by erenumab [1-4].', 'So far no serious side effects The side effects of erenumab – as far as the earlier rather shorter studies at least – do not seem to be serious: those who used erenumab complained a little more frequently than those with the dummy medication about injection site reactions, constipation, muscle cramps and itching [6].', 'Because erenumab has so far only been compared with placebo.', 'No long-term data The results on efficacy and safety first sound as if people with a similar condition as in the studies could actually benefit from erenumab.']",0,The claim that erenumab reduces the number of migraine days per month is supported by studies showing that it spares individuals with episodic migraines an average of 1 to 2 migraine days per month compared to a sham medication.,"In five studies available to date, which tend to be shorter, participants suffered from migraine less frequently with erenumab than with a placebo. The studies were of high methodological quality. In episodic migraine, people ""saved"" about 1 to 2 migraine days per month . For chronic migraine, sufferers had about 2.5 fewer days of pain per month. However, the efficacy and safety data relate to a maximum time frame of six months; the long-term benefit still needs to be explored. The benefit of erenumab compared to other established preventive migraine drugs has also not yet been researched."
Do saw palmetto preparations help with benign prostate enlargement?,"['[4] [7] A well substantiated statement can only be made for saw palm preparations: A data analysis published in 2012 shows that these remedies do not work better than placebos and are therefore ineffective.', 'However, it might be useful to continue to follow certain indications of symptom-improving plants and to compare them with new studies – at least in older studies, extracts of the African plum tree, willow grass pollen and the plant ingredient beta-sitosterin were considered safe and possibly effective.', '[updated and supplemented on March 1, 2015 with details on saw palm extracts, beta sitosterol, extracts of the African plum tree and willow grass pollen extract] ( Author: J. Harlfinger, Review: B. Kerschner, C. Christof ) Recommend article:']",2,"The claim that saw palmetto preparations help with benign prostate enlargement is disputed as a 2012 data analysis found them to be no more effective than placebos, rendering them ineffective.","Many men with benign prostate enlargement turn to herbal remedies. However, current evidence for reliable and long-term efficacy is generally lacking, and most remedies are not well studied. It is therefore not possible to lump all products together. Preparations containing the plant ingredient beta-sitosterol, extracts of the African plum tree or ryegrass pollen extract could possibly lead to some improvement - however, this cautious assumption is based on outdated data. However, the current finding is this: remedies containing saw palmetto do not work any better than placebo and are thus considered ineffective."
Does not wearing bras provide medical benefits?,"['Our conclusion Scientific evidence on health advantages or disadvantages of bras is missing.', 'Also the studies, on the basis of which it is recommended to wear a well-seated bra in a painful breasts, are not meaningful: In a work already over 40 years old 114 women with a painful breast got to wear a well-suited bra, for which they could choose from 144 different sizes [2].', 'Thus, it remains unclear whether, for example, there would have been an improvement even without bra treatment.', 'In the bra group, all women initially complained of a lack of comfort, but later 85 percent of patients reported an improvement in chest discomfort.']",1,"The claim that not wearing bras provides medical benefits lacks conclusive evidence, as existing studies on bra-wearing and health advantages are either outdated or methodologically flawed, leaving the question of potential benefits unclear.","Whether it is healthier or even beneficial not to wear a bra cannot be answered due to a lack of studies. Conversely, a few studies claim that well-fitting bras could prevent breast pain. However, the studies are methodologically weak and have virtually no validity."
Are there medical benefits to wearing a bra?,"['No evidence that a bra changes the breast In our extensive searches, we only received one piece of work on the subject: in 1990 eleven women in Japan were examined how the consistent wearing of a strong supportive bra affects [1].', 'A change in shape of the chest by bras is thus not proven, just as no health benefits by omitting a bra.', 'Instead, we found the opposite recommendation: women who occasionally suffer from aching breasts could allegedly get relief with a well-seated bra [5-7].', 'Whether wearing a bra helps against aching breasts is scientifically unproven.', 'Also the studies, on the basis of which it is recommended to wear a well-seated bra in a painful breasts, are not meaningful: In a work already over 40 years old 114 women with a painful breast got to wear a well-suited bra, for which they could choose from 144 different sizes [2].']",1,"The claim that wearing a bra has medical benefits is uncertain, as while some studies suggest that a well-fitting bra may provide relief for women with aching breasts, the evidence is limited and not conclusive.","Whether it is healthier or even beneficial not to wear a bra cannot be answered due to a lack of studies.
