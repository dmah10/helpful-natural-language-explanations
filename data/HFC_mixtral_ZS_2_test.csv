Can masks reduce corona infections when worn by a large proportion of the population?,"['Studies show slow spread After three years of pandemic, there are now relatively meaningful data that masks can slow down the spread of the Corona virus.', 'Surgical masks, in turn, seem to reduce the risk of infecting themselves with the corona virus.']",0,"The first sentence supports the claim by indicating that studies show masks can slow down the spread of the Corona virus, while the second sentence provides additional evidence that surgical masks specifically can reduce the risk of self-infection.","International studies suggest that the number of corona infections decreases when many people wear masks - whether fabric, surgical or FFP2 masks. However, it is not possible to precisely quantify how great the protective effect actually is. It probably depends on the type of masks and the proportion of people who wear them."
Can homeopathic preparations with Anamirta cocculus help against dizziness?,"['But without success: We could not find any meaningful scientific evidence for effectiveness in dizziness.', 'It is now well proven by studies that homeopathic preparations usually do not work better than a sham medication (placebo) [8].', 'However, it is not well established that betahistine is effective against dizziness [11.13].', 'The fact that betahist helps with dizziness is not well documented [11, 13].']",1,"While there is no strong scientific evidence supporting the use of homeopathic preparations with Anamirta cocculus for dizziness, the effectiveness of betahistine, a conventional treatment, is also not well documented according to the provided sentences.","We have found only one study that has investigated this. However, it is so poor that no reliable statement is possible."
Can zeolite alleviate or prevent health problems?,"['However, none of these can provide any evidence – because the studies have no significance (for reasons see section Studies in detail ).', 'It does not find an advantage for zeolite – but the results are hardly meaningful.', 'However, it is not researched whether the regular intake of zeolite can lead to a nutrient deficiency or has an undesirable effect on digestion.']",1,"The claim that zeolite can alleviate or prevent health problems is not supported by the provided sentences, which indicate a lack of significant studies and unclear effects on nutrition and digestion.",Studies to date cannot provide any evidence that taking zeolite prevents or alleviates complaints. A detoxifying effect is not scientifically plausible.
"Does starting school later improve health, learning success, and quality of life in adolescents?","['However, teenagers and parents now have to be very strong: despite 27 studies involving hundreds of thousands of students, no clear results can be derived from research.', 'The problem: The studies usually come to contradictory results.', 'So until better research results are available, all troubled young people and parents will only have the option of remaining out of bed early – or to hope that, despite lack of evidence, the school management will still have an insight into it.', 'It is difficult to examine whether a later start to school will have a positive effect.', 'The Problems: Unknown Influencing Factors: If differences occur in previous-after-studies, these do not have to be due to the later start of school – they may also have been caused by other changes over the course of the study period.']",1,"The claim cannot be definitively supported or refuted due to contradictory results from hundreds of thousands of students across 27 studies, and the presence of unknown influencing factors that could affect the outcomes.","The question has been investigated in several large studies. Due to methodological deficiencies and contradictory results, no firm conclusions can be drawn. This means that science can currently neither speak for nor against a benefit of a later school start."
Does the F.X. Mayr cure have health benefits? Can it prevent diseases or treat them?,"['Thus, the claim that the method can help with various diseases is not scientifically justified.', 'These studies cannot answer whether these changes also affect health.', 'Mayr cure or other fasting methods improve health in the long term, however, cannot be concluded.']",1,"The claim that the F.X. Mayr cure has health benefits or can prevent or treat diseases is not supported, as scientific justification is lacking and long-term health improvements from fasting methods like the Mayr cure are not conclusive.","It is neither examined nor proven whether the special fasting method after F.X. Mayr holds, which it promises: Namely assistance with all possible illnesses of allergies, over rheumatism up to sleep disturbances. The advertised detoxification and ""purification"" of the body by the chamfering cure are besides scientifically not plausible."
Does extract from the Damiana plant (Turnera diffusa) help with erectile dysfunction?,"['Efficacy does not appear to have been studied or demonstrated.', 'The studies in detail We could not find any studies on Damiana extract against erectile dysfunction in men.', 'Studies on the product Neradin also appear to be missing.']",1,"The claim that Damiana plant extract helps with erectile dysfunction is not supported by any studies, as mentioned in the sentences provided.","The extract from the Damiana plant (Turnera diffusa) is advertised as a remedy for erectile dysfunction for men. However, this claimed effect on potency is by no means proven. It has apparently never been tested on humans. This also applies to homeopathic remedies such as the product Neradin."
"In everyday life, when breathing with an FFP2 mask or ordinary mouth-nose protection, do you get as much oxygen as without a mask?","['As much oxygen as without a mask This fear is, however, unfounded, as previously conducted studies show [ 1,2 ].', 'Only in very strenuous sports (fast cycling to exhaustion) was the oxygen content in the blood with FFP2 mask slightly lower than without mask.', 'There was no difference in oxygen measurement with ordinary oral nose protection.', 'Breathing a little more strenuous The results thus contradict the rumor that masks would cause an oxygen deficiency.']",0,"The claim is supported by the sentences, as previous studies indicate that there is no significant difference in oxygen intake when wearing an FFP2 mask or ordinary mouth-nose protection, except for very strenuous sports, which does not apply to everyday life.","Even if breathing with a mask can feel uncomfortable: According to studies to date, you get just as much oxygen with an FFP2 mask or mouth-nose protection as without a mask. This is true even when you are moving or exerting yourself. Only very intensive sports slightly reduce the oxygen content in the blood - but too little to endanger health."
Do spermidine supplements or a spermidine-rich diet reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia? Do they help with existing dementia?,"['Spermidin studies: not enough as evidence of efficacy Even if both studies had come to overwhelmingly positive results, we would still have concerns about their significance.', 'Spermidine, which is additionally absorbed by food, is not sufficiently researched at the present time.', 'The number of participants is low and the risk is high that the results are not transferable to reality.', 'We do not consider the study to be meaningful.', 'Results: Both the spermidine group and the comparator group had fewer dementia symptoms and better mental performance at the end of the study.']",1,"The claim is not sufficiently supported by the provided sentences, as the studies on spermidine's effects on dementia symptoms have low participant numbers, increasing the risk that the results may not be transferable to reality, and spermidine's efficacy is not yet thoroughly researched.","Manufacturers of spermidine drugs advertise an alleged positive effect on mental performance and protection against dementia. However, such an effect has not been proven in meaningful studies. We found a single study in which dementia patients had participated. However, their results are not very clear."
Does the pill affect the muscle strength of women??,"['Does the pill also affect muscle strength?', 'The available studies do not provide any indication of such an effect.']",2,"The claim that the pill affects women's muscle strength is not supported by the provided sentences, which state that current studies do not indicate such an effect.","Taking the pill could possibly impair endurance performance in sports somewhat. However, there are no indications of less muscle strength due to the pill. However, these - somewhat contradictory - findings are anything but certain. Whether the somewhat reduced endurance performance speaks against contraception with the pill, each athlete must decide for herself - depending on how important top athletic performance is for her."
Does blood type affect the likelihood that Covid 19 disease will take a severe course or lead to death?,"['Here, the results found seem to contradict the influence of the blood group on the probability of death: the researchers found no connection between certain blood groups and the severity of the disease.', 'Overall, the available data are not meaningful enough to establish or exclude a relationship between the blood group and the course of covid-19 disease.', 'It is certain that no one is protected from a serious Covid-19 history because of their type of blood.', 'No evidence of severe progression in certain blood groups The researchers found no evidence that in the case of a Covid-19 disease, people with a particular blood group need to be treated more frequently in hospital or intensive care units.']",1,"The claim that blood type affects the severity of Covid-19 disease is not supported by the provided sentences, which indicate no connection between blood groups and disease severity or hospitalization rates.",There is no reliable evidence that people with a certain blood group are more severely affected by covid-19 than those with another. Study results on this are poorly substantiated and partly contradictory.
Do sedatives and sleeping pills such as benzodiazepines and related substances increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease or other forms of dementia?,"['However, it cannot be clearly dispelled by the fact that benzodiazepines and similar substances could promote the development of dementia.']",1,"The sentence suggests a potential link between benzodiazepines and dementia, aligning with the claim but not providing sufficient evidence to strongly support or refute it.","A link between the long-term use of sedatives and sleeping pills and the development of dementia cannot be ruled out. However, whether the drugs are the cause of dementia is unclear. Likewise, it is possible that studies show a connection only because people in the undiagnosed early stages of dementia suffer more frequently from sleep disorders or restlessness and therefore take medication against them more often."
Does taking probiotics shorten the duration of acute infectious diarrhea?,"['Thus, at least in children, taking live probiotics is unlikely to affect whether they are still ill after 48 hours.', 'Thus, a probiotic apparently has no clear influence on the resolution of the disease.']",2,"The sentences suggest that probiotics do not have a clear influence on resolving acute infectious diarrhea in children within 48 hours, which contradicts the claim of probiotics potentially shortening the duration of the disease.","According to current studies, the duration of disease cannot be reduced by taking probiotics. This assessment is reasonably well supported."
Can homeopathic remedies prevent colds in children?,"['Benefits for prevention improbable The conclusion of the review work: Homeopathy is probably not an effective means of preventing colds in children.', 'Children who regularly took homeopathic medicines were not less likely to become ill in the meaningful studies and their colds were not milder.', 'Overall, the studies could not find a preventive effect of homeopathic medicines; they did not reduce the frequency or severity of cold diseases.']",2,"The claim that homeopathic remedies can prevent colds in children is refuted by the sentences stating that children who regularly took homeopathic medicines were not less likely to become ill, and overall studies found no preventive effect of homeopathic medicines in reducing the frequency or severity of cold diseases.","Well-conducted studies find neither a preventive nor an alleviating effect of homeopathy on children's colds (chills). However, these studies have examined too few children for a truly conclusive result. Larger studies would be needed for a clear answer.  It is not scientifically plausible that homeopathic remedies are effective."
"Can the Wim Hof method - consisting of breathing training, meditation and acclimatization to cold - strengthen the immune system of healthy people and thus prevent infectious diseases?","['Cold without proven effect for health For none of these promises there is evidence.', 'The study also cannot answer whether trained people reacted less strongly to the bacterial poison than non-trained people – because they lack accurate data.', 'Even if the study had been carried out better, the extent to which this actually brings health benefits such as a reduced risk of infectious diseases is entirely speculative.', 'Even if it were better methodically, it could not answer whether it is the cold that does anything.', 'The cold records from Wim Hof are partly impressive, but whether cold training has a health benefit can not prove this study.']",1,The study's limitations and lack of evidence for a causal relationship prevent confirmation of the claim that the Wim Hof method strengthens the immune system to prevent infectious diseases.,"There are individual small studies on the Wim Hof method, but they are poor and inconclusive. Whether the method reduces the probability of infectious diseases has never been researched."
Does thyme help against cough?,"[""We couldn't find a single clinical trial that investigated exclusively thyme for an effect against cough."", 'Conjectures without evidence Although it is not proven that ingredients of the thyme can actually relieve cough, it is also not refuted.', 'However, there is no scientific evidence to date that the mucus solution itself has a relieving or shortening effect on cough [7,8].', 'Therefore, it cannot be said directly whether thyme alone can relieve cough.']",1,"While there is no clinical trial evidence specifically investigating thyme's effect on cough, and no scientific proof of its mucus solution relieving or shortening cough, it remains unproven but also unrefuted that thyme's ingredients can alleviate cough.",Whether thyme is effective against cough has not yet been researched in meaningful studies.
Is strophanthin an effective cardiovascular drug?,"['Furthermore, the positive results of strophanthin are not credible according to studies.', ""Whether strophanthin relieves symptoms of coronary heart disease or heart failure better than today's standard medications, can therefore not be derived from these studies."", 'Whether strophanthine has a benefit in this respect, the two found studies do not answer.']",1,"The provided sentences, which include a skeptical view of strophanthin's positive results and an absence of evidence for its superiority over standard medications, do not provide enough information to support the claim of its effectiveness as a cardiovascular drug.","We found two small flawed studies. They only investigated whether complaints improve in the short term, but not the long-term effect on disease progression and deaths. Since the studies are quite old, it is also not possible to assess how strophanthin compares with modern, well-studied drugs."
Is colloidal gold good for health?,"['Apparently, humans have never been investigated whether or which preventive and healing effects could have drinkable gold nanoparticles.', ""The Vienna Environmental Attorney's Office also came to this conclusion: it warned against solutions with silver and gold nanoparticles, as too little is known about their possible harmfulness [5]."", 'Gold against rheumatism A judgment on colloidal gold is therefore not possible due to lack of scientific evidence.', 'Further information We have already reported on the potential benefits and dangers of nanosilver in another article.The studies in detail There are no well-made studies that have investigated the effectiveness of colloidal gold.']",1,"The claim cannot be supported or refuted with the provided information, as there is a lack of scientific studies on the health effects of colloidal gold.","Statements about a possible health benefit of ""drinkable nano gold"" are not possible, because there are no good studies about it. Gold in other forms can help with rheumatism and other diseases, but side effects often occur."
Can acoustic CR ® neuromodulation according to Tass help with tinnitus?,"['Whether the acoustic CR neuromodulation has a positive effect in tinnitus is therefore scientifically unproven (but also not excluded).', 'After both neuromodulation and sham treatment, the participants felt that tinnitus was quieter and less burdensome.', 'Neuromodulation did not appear to be clearly effective.']",1,"While some participants reported reduced tinnitus severity after neuromodulation, its effectiveness is not clearly established, leaving the claim unproven.","The only two potentially meaningful studies cannot answer the question. This is because they are small and have serious flaws. A large study intended to show the effectiveness of ""acoustic coordinated reset (CR) neuromodulation"" for tinnitus produced inconclusive results - and was never published. Whether the therapy can help with tinnitus thus remains questionable."
Does ivermectin lower the risk of death in covid-19?,"['According to you, there is no evidence that ivermectin can prevent deaths.', 'However, since there were only 35 deaths in all studies taken together, no reliable conclusions can be drawn for the event outside the studies.']",1,"The claim cannot be reliably supported or refuted with the provided sentences, as the total number of deaths in the studies is low and there is no evidence presented of ivermectin's impact on death risk outside those studies.","Studies to date suggest that ivermectin does not mitigate covid-19. There is also no evidence that the drug can prevent deaths from covid-19. However, a possible beneficial effect cannot be ruled out with certainty either. Larger studies would be needed for this."
"Can budesonide spray inhalation for covid-19 reduce the risk of hospitalization, severe or even fatal outcome?",['It is unclear whether serious patients benefit from budesonide or whether the asthma medication can prevent deaths from Covid-19.'],1,"The claim that budesonide spray inhalation can reduce the risk of hospitalization, severe or fatal outcome from Covid-19 is not supported by the provided sentence, which states that it is unclear if serious patients benefit from budesonide or if it can prevent deaths from Covid-19.","In mild covid-19 disease, the cortisone preparation budesonide may be able to alleviate symptoms somewhat and make patients feel better more quickly. However, these results are not well established. The study results available to date cannot reliably answer the question of whether patients with budesonide also need to be hospitalized less often. It is also unclear whether budesonide can also help severely ill patients or prevent deaths caused by Covid-19."
Does a nasal spray with carrageenan from red algae prevent infection with coronavirus? Can it alleviate a covid 19 disease that has already broken out?,"['It is therefore unclear whether a nasal spray with carrages from red algae can protect against infection with the corona virus.', 'For several reasons, however, we cannot deduce that the Carrageen spray protects against a corona infection: For us, it was not comprehensible.', 'Treatment Covid-19 For the (supporting) treatment of Covid-19 with a carragen spray from red algae, we have not found any studies.']",1,"The claim that a nasal spray with carrageenan from red algae prevents infection with the coronavirus or alleviates Covid-19 is not supported by the provided sentences, which indicate a lack of understanding and studies on the topic.","Whether such a spray can in principle protect against infection with the coronavirus has not yet been researched. Studies exist only on the treatment of Covid-19, but these are grossly deficient and therefore inconclusive."
Are rapid antigen tests as reliable as slower PCR tests? Does a negative (inconspicuous) rapid test result reliably exclude an infection with the coronavirus?,"['A negative test result is also only a snapshot: Even if the antigen test is inconspicuous, you can already have infected yourself, and the test might be positive the following day.', 'Rapid tests do not allow the corona virus to be detected in as small quantities as PCR tests.', 'PCR tests are also not infallible, but they are currently considered the most reliable method of detecting infection with SARS-CoV-2.']",2,"A negative rapid test result does not reliably exclude an infection with the coronavirus, as rapid tests may not detect the virus in small quantities and a subsequent test could be positive.","Rapid antigen tests are more flexible and faster than PCR tests. However, the reliability of rapid antigen tests depends heavily on the timing of the test: the tests are most reliable when the first symptoms appear. Rapid antigen tests do not come close to the reliability of longer PCR tests."
Can lung cancer screening by computed tomography (CT) also do harm???,"[""So Salopp's wording is unclear whether people with screening are less likely to die of lung cancer, but they may be ill in the rest of their lives, for example through stressful treatments."", 'Also consider disadvantages The probable, but rather small use of the screening is opposed to some disadvantages: False alarms are likely to occur among 1 to 15 out of 1000 participants in the screening group.', 'Up to 22 out of 1000 screened people are expected to be diagnosed with ""overdiagnoses"" – lung cancer, which would not have been detected without screening, because it does not cause any symptoms throughout the life.', 'Another reason not to screen further: if another disease occurs, which probably significantly shortens the lifespan or leads to the patient being unable to operate on the lungs for cancer treatment [6].']",0,"The claim is supported by the sentences, as they discuss potential harms of lung cancer screening through CT, such as false alarms, overdiagnoses, and the impact of other diseases on treatment options.","Screening in the high-risk group likely prevents deaths from lung cancer. Whether the screened individuals actually live longer and have a higher quality of life is not clear. There are also risks: On the one hand, some screened individuals receive a diagnosis of lung cancer but would not have experienced symptoms during their lifetime. Furthermore, a small proportion of screened individuals must expect a false-positive result (""false alarm""). Until the all-clear is given, interventions are necessary for clarification, during which complications can occur."
Does gargling with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) help against coronavirus or others in throat infections?,"['We could not find studies on gurgling with hydrogen peroxide to prevent or treat infections in the throat room.', 'However, it is not plausible that gurgling with hydrogen peroxide can protect against infections with the corona virus.', 'Equally unexplored and questionable is whether hydrogen peroxide is suitable for the treatment of coronavirus infection.', 'It is also one of the natural defense mechanisms with which the body fights against bacteria and viruses [2].The studies in detail In spite of intensive research, we received no answers to the question whether hydrogen peroxide as a Gurgel solution can prevent or combat infections in the throat area.']",1,"The claim that gargling with hydrogen peroxide helps against coronavirus or other throat infections is not supported by the provided sentences, which state that there is no evidence or plausible mechanism for hydrogen peroxide preventing or treating such infections.","Whether hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as a gargle solution is suitable to treat or prevent COVID-19, sore throats or colds has never been scientifically studied. Neither has whether regular use is harmful. However, if hydrogen peroxide is swallowed or inhaled, there may be health consequences."
Does vitamin D prevent covid-19 disease? Does vitamin D mitigate the course of Covid 19 disease?,"[""But they can't give answers – for example, if the person with vitamin D is better after four weeks than without extra vitamin D. It is also unclear whether the treatment can prevent deaths."", 'Whether the intake of vitamin D reduces the risk of disease in these people cannot be answered by the observational studies.', 'But in vain, no preventive studies on vitamin D and corona appear to have been published.']",1,"The claim is not sufficiently supported by the provided sentences, as they indicate a lack of preventive studies and clear answers regarding vitamin D's role in reducing the risk of disease or preventing deaths from Covid-19.",Studies to date on the treatment of covid-19 cannot answer whether vitamin D can alleviate the disease. No studies have yet been published on a possible preventive effect.
Does vitamin B3 protect against severe covid-19 events?,"['Why such studies from the perspective of some experts seem promising at all, however, does not make us quite clear: because the reasons for the planned studies cite almost exclusively possible mechanisms of action at cell level, not even animal experiments with vitamin B3.', 'Whether vitamin B3 helps to prevent severe Covid-19 processes remains to be seen.', 'This vitamin deficiency disease can alter the skin and mucous membranes, but can also cause neurological disorders [3].The studies in detail For the benefit of vitamin B3 in Covid-19, we have not found completed meaningful studies.', 'Based on these very preliminary (and usually not used by us) sources, we believe that we can identify potential weaknesses of the study: In this way, two treatments with unknown effects are tested and compared within the study: We do not know whether they help from vitamin B3 or from silica.']",1,"The claim that vitamin B3 protects against severe Covid-19 events is not supported by the provided sentences, as there is a lack of completed meaningful studies and the single study mentioned compares two treatments with unknown effects, making it difficult to determine if benefits come from vitamin B3 or silica.",We could not find any completed meaningful studies on this topic. Two ongoing studies are currently investigating the question.
Does ozonated vegetable oil help against vaginal fungus??,"['However, only with little success: For internal use (drips for swallowing) of ozonated vegetable oils we could not find any studies that are at least reasonably meaningful.', 'The question whether ozonated oils help at least as well with various fungal infections as conventional drugs cannot be answered for us.', 'For us, however, this is no evidence that ozonated oil is a good alternative to conventional anti-fungal agents.']",1,"While there is no significant evidence supporting the use of ozonated vegetable oil for internal treatment of vaginal fungus, its efficacy compared to conventional drugs remains unanswered.",We could not find any studies on these questions that we considered trustworthy.
Does melatonin help against jet lag?,"['Overall, the studies show that melatonin may help better against jetlag than a sham drug.', 'Reliable statements on side effects of melatonin cannot be made on the basis of the studies.', 'Difficult Summary In the systematic review work [1] four studies with a total of around 140 participants could be combined mathematically: According to this, people with melatonin have less jet-lag complaints than people who took a placebo.']",0,"The claim is supported by the first sentence stating that melatonin may help better against jetlag than a sham drug, and the third sentence indicating fewer jet-lag complaints in people who took melatonin compared to a placebo in four studies.","The best available studies suggest that melatonin may be effective against jet lag problems. However, this assessment is not well supported."
Does discontinuation of denosumab increase the risk of vertebral fractures???,"['The consequences of discontinuation of denosumab are insufficiently investigated.', 'However, it is unclear whether discontinuation actually leads to more bone fractures.', 'Therefore, no reliable statements can be made from the data as to whether the discontinuation of denosumab leads to bone fractures.']",1,"The claim cannot be supported or refuted with the provided sentences, as they indicate that there is insufficient evidence to determine whether discontinuation of denosumab increases the risk of vertebral fractures.",The pooled results of studies to date show that denosumab reduces the risk of vertebral fractures more than a placebo. It may even be slightly more protective than single other osteoporosis drugs.  It cannot be ruled out that discontinuing denosumab increases the likelihood of vertebral fractures again. The studies on this are contradictory.
Does deuterium-reduced water improve disease progression in cancer???,"['The theoretical considerations for this have not necessarily convinced us: Laboratory and animal tests are reported on websites as an argument for deuterium-reduced water.', ""Unreliable For patients with prostate cancer, a benefit of deuterium-reduced water cannot be safely demonstrated with the study found, even if the author's team reports otherwise."", 'At least in our review, we came to the conclusion that there is no clear difference in mortality between the two groups, with a more appropriate method from our point of view.']",1,"The claim is not supported by the sentences provided, as there is no clear difference in mortality between groups consuming deuterium-reduced water and those who do not, and the single study mentioned did not demonstrate a benefit for prostate cancer patients.","We found only one study with prostate cancer patients comparing deuterium-reduced water with normal water. This small study has numerous flaws, so the results are not conclusive. We were unable to locate reliable studies on its use in other cancers or for cancer prevention."
Does therapeutic dancing help people with Parkinson's improve their movement problems?,"[""Small improvements – perhaps In fact, the summarized results of previous studies suggest that dancing can help with Parkinson's disease – at least a little [1]."", 'Compared to no therapy, dancing improved movement restrictions by around 8 points on this scale.', 'Compared to exercise therapy, dancing improved movement restrictions by around 2 points on this scale.']",0,"The claim is supported by the sentences as they suggest that dancing can help improve movement restrictions in people with Parkinson's disease, with a greater improvement compared to no therapy than to exercise therapy.","Dancing could somewhat improve the movement problems of affected people. It is also possible that dancing performs slightly better compared to other movement exercises. Nevertheless, it does not seem to increase the quality of life noticeably."
Is it possible to reliably detect coronavirus infection based only on symptoms but without laboratory testing?,"['However, it appears that symptoms alone are not sufficient to reliably diagnose symptoms.', 'Neither the presence of certain symptoms nor their absence makes it possible to conclude with high certainty on Covid-19 or to exclude the infection.', 'At least at the moment, symptoms can only provide evidence that a more accurate investigation by means of a laboratory test is important.']",2,"The claim is refuted by the sentences, as they all indicate that symptoms alone are not sufficient to reliably diagnose or exclude a coronavirus infection, and can only suggest the need for further laboratory testing.","So far, no symptoms have emerged from which a covid 19 infection can be inferred with certainty. The absence of certain symptoms also does not allow an all-clear to be given. Thus, it appears that symptoms such as coughing, shortness of breath or loss of smell are not suitable for making a diagnosis. Laboratory tests (""PCR tests"") are currently the safest option (as of August 2020)."
Are home coronavirus self-tests as reliable as tests performed by trained healthcare professionals?,"['Do-it-yourself tests: Study situation thin We could not find any studies that investigated how reliable Corona self-tests are for home compared to professionally performed tests.', ""Whether the do-it-yourself variant of the Corona test is just as good as the professionally performed test directly in the laboratory or the doctor's office, therefore remains unexplained."", 'In this case, the test should be repeated approximately one or two days later [5].The studies in detail We could not find any studies on how reliable self-tests for home can detect an infection with the new Coronavirus – compared to a test by professionals.']",1,The claim cannot be confirmed or refuted with the provided sentences since there is no information about a comparison of home coronavirus self-tests and tests performed by professionals.,"Whether self-tests from the drugstore or pharmacy provide as reliable results as a test by trained health personnel has not yet been investigated. Errors are possible when taking the sample at home. Things can also go wrong in transit to the laboratory. This can affect the accuracy of the test result. But whether done by yourself or by trained personnel, even the best Corona test is not one hundred percent reliable."
"Does taking supplements with omega-3 fatty acids reduce the risk of heart attack, stroke or other sudden cardiovascular problems?

Do preparations with unsaponifiable components of avocado and soybean oils (ASU) help against limitations and pain in osteoarthritis of the hip joint?,"['In contrast, the participants were not better off with a hip arthritis.', 'This obviously does not apply to arthrosis in the hip joint.', 'The ASU preparations apparently do not relieve pain and movement restrictions under these conditions.']",2,"The sentences suggest that ASU preparations do not alleviate pain and movement restrictions in hip arthritis or hip osteoarthritis, directly contradicting the claim of their effectiveness in managing limitations and pain in osteoarthritis of the hip joint.",There is evidence of minor efficacy of preparations containing avocado and soybean oil (ASU). They can probably somewhat alleviate movement restrictions and pain in osteoarthritis of the knee joint - at least in the short term. An effect in osteoarthritis of the hip joint has not yet been shown. Side effects are not to be expected.
Can taking chondroitin relieve osteoarthritis pain or improve mobility in the long term?,"['However, studies so far probably do not indicate that chondroitin can help people with osteoarthritis.', 'The combined research results [1-9] show that chondroitin intake probably does not improve pain or mobility.', 'However, the summarized results of previous studies show that also the combination of chondroitin and glucosamine may not relieve symptoms of osteoarthritis [1,4,6,7,9].', 'The result is similar in all nine cases: a noticeable improvement of the symptoms due to chondroitin is unlikely.']",2,"The consensus across studies [1-9] indicates that chondroitin is unlikely to alleviate osteoarthritis pain or improve mobility, contradicting the claim.","In the studies conducted to date, chondroitin did not lead to any noticeable overall improvement in the symptoms of osteoarthritis.

Do air purifiers help relieve symptoms of allergic asthma?,"['They suggest that air purifiers cannot improve a number of symptoms: the lungs of the study participants were not more efficient when using an air purifier than without, the sufferers could not reduce their asthma medications, and the disease did not seem to progress more slowly [1].', 'It is also not clear whether it makes sense to use air purifiers as part of a treatment concept: they do not seem to be able to control asthma better.', 'No statements on current air purifiers The summarized results of previous studies suggest that air purifiers in normal households are not able to significantly reduce the number of allergens in indoor air [1].', 'It comes to the result described that symptoms cannot improve, medication cannot be reduced, deteriorations cannot be stopped and allergens are not sufficiently removed from the air.']",2,"The claim that air purifiers help relieve symptoms of allergic asthma is refuted by the sentences stating that air purifiers do not improve lung efficiency, reduce asthma medications, slow disease progression, control asthma better, or significantly reduce allergens in indoor air.","In our literature search, we found no evidence that air purifiers can help control allergic asthma. According to previous studies, they are unlikely to filter enough allergenic substances from indoor air to relieve symptoms or reduce medication."
Does platelet-rich plasma therapy (autologous blood therapy) reduce pain in osteoarthritis of the knee joint?,"['Less pain possible Treatment may reduce knee pain better than sham treatment, but the effect is likely to be low.', 'Treatment can cause the function of a joint to be maintained for longer, wear can be slowed down, or pain can simply be improved.']",0,"The first sentence suggests that platelet-rich plasma therapy may reduce knee pain in osteoarthritis compared to a sham treatment, but the effect is likely to be small, supporting the claim. The second sentence indicates that the treatment can maintain joint function, slow down wear, or improve pain, which also supports the claim.","Injections with platelet-rich plasma could slightly reduce pain in osteoarthritis of the knee. The therapy is apparently more effective than placebo treatment, but the effect is small.  For the hip, on the other hand, studies tend to point toward no efficacy. Local side effects are common. Which form of therapy is best for whom has not yet been clarified, and long-term success has not been studied."
Does ACE inhibitors like ramipril increase the risk of lung cancer?,"['Contradictory results Previous studies also had problems in providing a clear answer.', 'The research has produced contradictory results: in some cases, the risk of lung cancer was increased with ACE inhibitors, decreased or not altered in others.', 'Therefore, it is not certain whether the relationship found is really due to the ACE inhibitors.']",1,"The claim remains unresolved as research studies have shown contradictory results with some indicating an increased risk, decreased risk, or no change in lung cancer risk with ACE inhibitors like ramipril.","A large observational study has found an increased risk of lung cancer with long-term use of ACE inhibitors compared with another group of antihypertensive drugs. However, other causes for this association cannot be completely ruled out. Previous studies have reached inconsistent results. Therefore, it can currently neither be confirmed nor ruled out that the risk of lung cancer may increase with ACE inhibitors. Even if further studies should really confirm the increased risk, the effect is likely to be rather small."
Does DAILY administration of HIGH-dose atropine (0.5 - 1%) sustainably inhibit the progression of myopia in children?,"['One year after the end of the two-year daily atropin treatment, the advantage over the untreated children was no longer noticeable.', 'In the short term, less diopters In the three studies, the results were similar with daily drop-in at bedtime: at the end of treatment with 0.5 – 1% atropine, the short-sightedness was about 1 dioptrie lower than in the placebo group [1.3,4.7].']",2,"The claim is refuted by the sentences, as one year after the daily atropine treatment, there was no longer a difference in myopia progression between the treated and untreated children, and the short-term benefits disappeared shortly after stopping the treatment.","Drip-feeding high-dose atropine for 1-3 years probably inhibits the progression of myopia in the short term. If dripping is done daily, the effect does not seem to be noticeable 1 year after the end of treatment. If dripping is done monthly at first and then every 2 months, the effect is likely to last longer. Whether lower-dose atropine helps in the long term is poorly understood."
Does going to the sauna several times a week prolong women's lives???,"['In a second study [2] 867 Finnish women participated over a period of 15 years.', 'The study data cannot prove, but cannot exclude, a connection with a reduced risk of death.', 'On the basis of the data, it is not possible to confirm or exclude whether more frequent visits to saunas to the participating women are associated with a reduced probability of death.']",1,"The study's data suggests a potential association between sauna visits and reduced risk of death in women, but it does not provide definitive evidence to confirm or refute this claim.","Men who go to the sauna several times a week live longer than those who go only once a week. However, it is possible that this is not due to the sauna at all. For women, the effect of sauna visits has not been sufficiently researched."
"Can the combination of propolis, xyloglucan, gelatin and hibiscus (product ""Utipro Plus"") relieve the symptoms of cystitis or prevent cystitis?","['We could not find any studies on the effect of xyloglucan, gelatin, hibiscus or propolis as a single agent against bladder inflammation.', 'Whether pain and burning in the Utipro group have improved more than in the placebo group cannot be read out from the study – an analysis of the symptom progression would, in our view, be much more meaningful.', 'No statements possible Two studies [1,2] have also investigated whether Utipro Plus can prevent further bladder inflammation.']",1,"The claim cannot be supported or refuted based on the provided sentences, as there is no information about the effect of ""Utipro Plus"" on cystitis symptoms or prevention, and no studies on the individual components' effects are mentioned.","Three studies on the product ""Utipro Plus"" investigated the combination of these ingredients.

The studies arrived at widely divergent answers. In the studies with positive results, it is partly unclear whether the difference was actually noticeable for those affected. Quality of life and mobility were investigated in five and two studies, respectively - these were small and of little significance. In addition, the studies came to contradictory results."
Does taking Bacopa extract improve memory performance?,"['We have found no better memory by Bacopa a systematic overview [1], which has summarized nine studies with around 500 participants.', 'The conclusion, however, comes to a disappointing conclusion: All in all, it could not be proven that the Bacopa extract actually effectively improves memory and/or attention.', 'On the contrary, it seems that Bacopa should not have the desired effect.', 'No clear evidence of benefit For the vast majority of tests, the systematic review of the individual studies did not reveal any clear effects of the Bacopa extract.']",2,"The claim that Bacopa extract improves memory performance is refuted by the systematic overview of nine studies with around 500 participants, which found no clear evidence of benefit and even suggested a lack of the desired effect.","The question was investigated in several mainly properly done studies with more than 500 people. Overall, no significant positive effects on memory and attention were found. Since some of the studies arrived at very different results and the estimates were far apart, this clearly limits the significance of the result."
"Does bark extract from maritime pine (also: ""pine bark extract"") improve the symptoms of osteoarthritis?","['Unclear: Effect of pine bark extract However, no safe statements can be derived from the existing studies: Because the product with pine bark extract called pycnogenol was examined overall only with relatively few patients.', 'Some of the studies come to contradictory results and have significant methodological shortcomings.', 'Therefore, we cannot assess the importance of pycnogenol in the treatment of osteoarthritis compared to a dummy preparation.', 'However, no statements on possible undesirable effects can be derived from the bark extract.']",1,"The claim cannot be supported or refuted based on the provided sentences due to insufficient and contradictory evidence from studies with small sample sizes and methodological issues, making it difficult to assess the effectiveness of pine bark extract for osteoarthritis treatment compared to a placebo.","The question was investigated in three smaller studies.

Do vaginal suppositories containing the active ingredient imiquimod cause precancerous stages of cervical cancer to recede or disappear?,"['It suggests that the method should be effective in principle.', 'After 16 weeks it turned out: With imiquimod, the pre-stages were formed in 73 percent of women in whole or in part.Without the active ingredient, the pre-stages were formed in 39 percent of women in whole or in part.', 'This was similarly common in both groups: with imiquimod, the preliminary stages decreased to CIN 1 grade at 26 percent.Without imiquimod, the preliminary stages decreased to CIN 1 grade at 25 percent.Limited significance The small number of participants reduces the significance of the study.']",0,"The claim is not supported by the sentences, as they indicate that both with and without imiquimod, preliminary stages decreased to CIN 1 grade at similar rates, suggesting no advantage of imiquimod in causing precancerous stages to recede or disappear.","In the only study on this subject, treatment was successful in some of those affected. Since the study is flawed and only a few women participated in it, the significance is limited."
Can binaural beats relieve stress or anxiety before surgery and medical treatments?,"['The study team could not find differences between the groups in anxiety intensity.', 'In a well done study, we could now assume that binaural beats have no special effect.', 'But the significance of the study is low, and we cannot reliably draw this conclusion.']",1,"While one study found no significant difference in anxiety levels between those who listened to binaural beats and those who did not, the significance of this study is questioned, leaving uncertainty about the claim.","Previous studies are not conclusive.

Do pregnant women who take vitamin D have a lower risk of preterm birth?,"['Also in premature births or a too low growth of the unborn child, a lack of vitamin D in the mother is often recorded in parallel [1-3].', 'According to the summarized study results, it is likely that mothers will have less premature births due to the vitamin D preparations, i.e.', 'Although some of the studies analysed indicated that taking vitamin D could reduce the risk of complications such as pregnancy poisoning and gestational diabetes or low birth weight of the baby.']",0,"The first sentence suggests a correlation between vitamin D deficiency and premature birth or low fetal growth, implying that vitamin D supplementation might reduce the risk of preterm birth, which aligns with the claim.","Some studies with few participants suggest that taking vitamin D during pregnancy may reduce the risk of preterm birth. However, it seems to be just the opposite when pregnant women swallow vitamin D together with calcium. At least in one study, the risk of preterm birth increased in this case. The cause was not clear. Overall, many questions remain open; the study situation is not satisfactory enough to recommend vitamin D intake in principle for all pregnant women on this basis."
Does aromatherapy have other positive effects for dementia patients???,"['Apart from this exception (Lavendel-Aromatherapie), we do not know whether aromatherapy can help people with dementia [1] : Due to the current study situation, we cannot confirm or exclude efficacy.', 'However, we do not assume that aromatherapy has a very large, previously undiscovered positive effect on the symptoms and quality of life of dementia sufferers.']",1,"The claim that aromatherapy has other positive effects for dementia patients is not supported, as stated in the sentences, with current studies unable to confirm or exclude efficacy and no assumption of a large, undiscovered positive effect.","Based on the state of studies, it is largely unclear whether aromatherapy can help patients with dementia. There are quite a few studies on the subject, but many of them have gross flaws and are therefore not comparable. For example, studies with lemon balm aromatherapy have contradictory results. With lavender aromatherapy, on the other hand, a certain tendency has emerged: it does not seem to help against agitation and aggression - both typical accompanying symptoms of dementia."
Are statins useful in preventing cardiovascular disease in people 75 years and older???,"['Hardly any studies with older people Unfortunately, so far only a few researchers have specifically addressed the question of whether statins protect older people as well as younger ones.', 'There is no reliable data for people aged 75 and over.', 'Therefore, we cannot make statements about the efficacy and safety of statins for people with cardiovascular risk above 75.', 'In none of the individual studies that included older people, the researchers found a statistical indication that older people may benefit less (or more) from statins than younger people.']",1,"While some studies have included older people, there is no statistical evidence from these studies to suggest that statins have different effects in older people compared to younger people, and there is a lack of specific data for people aged 75 and over.","People with cardiovascular disease who do not take a statin die earlier. Without statins, heart attacks and strokes are also more likely to occur. This has not been studied in people aged 75 and older who do not yet have any pronounced cardiovascular disease, but only risk factors.

It is unclear whether animal milk increases the risk of type 1 diabetes or blood in the stool, or reduces the likelihood of allergic diseases."
Do extracts from grape seeds have a health-promoting effect?,"['In fact, there are a lot of studies with animals and cell cultures bred in the laboratory that suggest a potential efficacy of grape seed extract.', 'Based on studies conducted so far with humans, we cannot assess whether the extract has an effect.', 'In addition to the poor quality of most studies, contradictory results make a sound assessment of effectiveness difficult.']",1,"While some animal and cell culture studies suggest potential health benefits of grape seed extract, human studies are insufficient and contradictory, making a sound assessment of its effectiveness challenging.",The quality of studies available to date is too poor and the results are too contradictory to assess whether grape seed extract has a health-promoting effect.
"Does a supposedly ""alkaline-rich"" diet prevent chronic diseases?","['However, scientific studies investigating such a link between acidic or basal nutrition and the state of health have hardly been carried out.', 'Benefits of a basic diet questionable Overall, the benefits of a basic diet are questionable.', 'The additional base powder or other ""base-promoting"" food supplements, which are praised by representatives of the base theory, do not bring any expected benefits.']",1,"The claim of an alkaline-rich diet preventing chronic diseases lacks scientific backing, as studies are scarce and the benefits of a basic diet are questionable, with no proven advantages from base-promoting food supplements.","It is not likely that a supposedly ""acid-rich"" diet weakens the bones. There are no scientific studies on the effect on other diseases."
Do cell phones promote the development and growth of tumors in the head?,"['But even after more than 20 years of mobile phone use and research, there are no clear answers.', 'Conclusion Despite in-depth research, the studies are not convincing.', 'Even if mobile phones increase the risk of cancer, the risk increase is minimal: in absolute terms, the risk increases from 0.0072 percent to 0.0096 percent.']",1,"While research has been conducted for over 20 years, the studies do not provide convincing evidence that cell phones promote the development and growth of tumors in the head, and even if there is a minor increase in risk, it is absolute terms it remains very small.","Despite intensive research, it is currently still unclear whether cell phones promote tumor diseases. According to current knowledge, the risk increases only minimally, if at all."
Does the active ingredient rivaroxaban (drug Xarelto) have a higher risk of dangerous bleeding than other anticoagulants?,"['A summary analysis of studies published so far on rivaroxaban in particular also finds overall less fatal bleeding than in the use of vitamin K antagonists (cumarine) [4], although there has been no overall difference in the number of premature deaths.', 'The comparison of rivaroxaban with other factor Xa inhibitors shows only very small differences: According to a recent summary of several meta-analyses, the active substance of Xarelto does not perform best, but the result is uncertain.', 'Overall, these drugs have the same effect as the older vitamin K antagonist treatment, but with a significantly lower risk of bleeding – the risk is almost halved.', 'According to this, the new drugs avoid strokes more effectively than the older ones, with regard to the risk of bleeding there is no difference.']",2,"While rivaroxaban has been found to have a similar bleeding risk to other factor Xa inhibitors and a lower bleeding risk than vitamin K antagonists, there is no overall difference in the number of premature deaths compared to vitamin K antagonists, contradicting the claim of a higher dangerous bleeding risk.","High-quality studies in the most common uses of rivaroxaban show either an equal or even lower risk of bleeding than other blood-clotting medications. However, this does not mean it is the best choice in all cases. Research is still needed for bleeding in the stomach or intestines."
Are Vemma products good for health?,"['Quickly clarified There is no reason to believe that Vemma products have any health benefits; according to our research, they were only once the subject of a medical study – which, however, is completely unusable due to serious defects [1] Vemma, on the other hand, was often the subject of investigations, since the distribution system is very reminiscent of a pyramid game [b] [c].', 'However, the results are worthless for several reasons: there is no information on how the random assignment to the trial or placebo group happened, whether the blinding has kept, whether and how a blinding of the treating physicians has happened at all, the results contradict text and graphics and in the statistical analysis also serious errors have been made [1].']",1,"The claim that Vemma products are good for health is not supported, as the only medical study on them had serious defects and the distribution system resembles a pyramid scheme, according to the provided sentences.","We have found only one study that investigates health effects of Vemma. However, the study is so flawed that it does not allow us to draw any conclusions."
Can FLEXISEQ ointment relieve osteoarthritis pain?,"[""So the ointment FLEXISEQ would have to be compared to a placebo ointment – that hasn't happened yet; compared to a medication to be swallowed, a placebo to be swallowed, and an ointment with an active substance, but its effectiveness itself is not too clear."", 'So it is not sure whether the ointment helps better than a suitable placebo.', 'The study duration in the four individual studies described is a maximum of 12 weeks, so long-term effects have not yet been investigated.']",1,"While there is no comparison to a placebo ointment or investigation into long-term effects, the direct comparison to other treatments is unclear, making it uncertain whether FLEXISEQ ointment alleviates osteoarthritis pain better than a suitable placebo.",Comparisons to date with other commonly used treatments are difficult to interpret but do not yield clear evidence of efficacy.
Can butterbur prevent migraine attacks?,"['In summary, both studies show that it is twice as likely that the number of migraine attacks will halve after twelve weeks with the Pestwurz preparation compared to a dummy medication.', 'The above overviews are of different quality, but all come to the same conclusions due to the two same studies: Pestwurz can reduce the number of migraine attacks for some patients.']",0,"Both studies summarized indicate that butterbur, referred to as Pestwurz, has shown a higher likelihood of reducing the frequency of migraine attacks compared to a placebo, supporting the claim.","Two well-done randomized-controlled trials show efficacy - the number of migraine attacks can probably be reduced with butterbur. Even if the effect is not huge, taking it may be worthwhile due to only minor side effects."
Do vitamin E supplements increase the likelihood of early death?,"['The result: more deaths occur in the vitamin E group than in the comparison group without vitamin supplements.', 'This meta-analysis also results in a slightly increased number of deaths due to vitamin E preparations.', 'This calculates an increased risk of premature death in vitamin E intake by three percent [2].']",0,"The sentences provide evidence supporting the claim that vitamin E supplements increase the likelihood of early death, as they mention a higher number of deaths in the vitamin E group and a calculated increased risk of premature death.","Studies on this topic are very inconsistent. Nevertheless, there is a possibility that vitamin E increases the risk of death. A meta-analysis warns against high-dose vitamin preparations."
Does less than 7h of sleep daily increase mental performance?,"['Already six hours of sleep reduce brain performance The results of a small randomized-controlled study [1] clearly contradict the claim of performance-enhancing sleep loss.', 'After only a few nights it became apparent: the shorter the participants could sleep at night, the worse they did in the tests compared to the group with eight hours of sleep.', 'The performance of the sleep deficit group was significantly worse after five days compared to the control group, although the impact is limited by the small size of the control group.', 'This shows that lack of sleep actually seemed to be the cause of the worse mental performance.', 'Overall, if you sleep only six or less hours per night, you will hardly be wiser, but it seems to impair your mental performance.']",2,"The sentences provide evidence that less than 7h of sleep daily decreases mental performance, contradicting the claim.",Two small randomized-controlled studies indicate that mental performance decreases with the number of sleepless hours per night and the number of nights with insufficient sleep. No single scientific study provides evidence of an increase in mental performance due to shorter sleep duration.
Do frequent ejaculations have a protective effect against prostate cancer?,"['Result: Men with frequent ejaculations between 20 and 30 years of age have a one-third reduced prostate cancer risk compared to those with rare ejaculations [1].', ""Taking the result seriously, it doesn't show that much self-satisfaction protects, but rather that men with very few ejaculations could have a slightly higher risk of prostate cancer."", 'Here it turns out that frequent ejaculations from the age of four years onwards or over the entire life span may reduce the risk of prostate cancer [3].', 'In sum, the study provides evidence that with increasing ejaculation frequency, the risk of prostate cancer could actually decrease.']",0,"The claim is supported by the sentences, as they suggest a correlation between frequent ejaculations and reduced prostate cancer risk, starting from age four and potentially throughout life.","A cohort study suggests that more frequent ejaculations starting at age 40, or over a lifetime, could potentially lower the risk of prostate cancer. This is not exclusive to ejaculations from masturbation, but from any sexual activity."
Do today's children have a shorter life expectancy than their parents?,"['Overweight leads to a higher rate of premature deaths – which reduces life expectancy on average by 3 to 9 months.', 'So it would be a reversal of the trend: for the first time in a long time, children would have a life expectancy less than their parents.', 'There are some reasons to assume that it will be worse than the 3 to 9 months less: Obesity is becoming more common and occurs in increasingly younger children [1].', 'If this trend continues, there may be a reduction in life expectancy of three to five years.']",0,"The claim is not directly supported by the sentences, as they discuss a potential reduction in life expectancy due to obesity, but do not provide concrete evidence that today's children already have a shorter life expectancy than their parents.","Obesity and physical inactivity are increasing risk factors worldwide that can shorten life. In 2005, a study from the USA concluded that life expectancy could be reduced by 3 to 9 months when these risks were included."
Does training on vibration platforms cause a noticeable buildup of muscle strength?,"['Therefore, training on vibration platforms could actually strengthen the muscle strength of the leg muscles.', 'However, compared to conventional strengthening training, the results do not indicate superiority of vibration platforms.', 'According to the results of this study, it could be concluded at most that training on a vibration platform in combination with a diet can lead to weight loss, which could also be achieved by a conventional fitness program or a mere diet without exercise program.']",0,"While training on vibration platforms may strengthen leg muscles to some extent, it does not show superiority over conventional strengthening training and can only contribute to weight loss when combined with a diet, which can also be achieved through conventional fitness programs or diets without exercise.","Vibration training may be helpful for building muscle strength in the legs, but it is not better than conventional training for this purpose. Whether the method is also suitable for weight reduction has not been sufficiently studied."
Do generic drugs work as well as original drugs?,"['Results & Interpretation In a review of 7 individual studies [1] published in 2010, three active substances against epilepsy were compared with generic drugs, with no evidence of an increased probability of seizures.', 'For none of the active substances studied, there was evidence of a lower efficacy of the generic medicinal product.', 'Based on the studies published so far, there is no evidence of inferiority of generic medicinal products compared to original medicinal products.']",0,"The review of seven studies in 2010 found no increased probability of seizures with generic drugs and no evidence of lower efficacy compared to original drugs for three active substances against epilepsy, providing support for the claim that generic drugs work as well as original drugs.","Yes, the summarized results of clinical studies do not provide any evidence for a poorer efficacy of generics compared to originator drugs. However, comparative studies exist only for some agents against cardiovascular diseases and epilepsy."
Does UV light reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease?,"['The result: 20 minutes under artificial UVA light may reduce blood pressure slightly in the short term.', 'Whether regular UVA irradiation can also reduce blood pressure in the long term cannot be predicted from this, longer-term studies would be necessary.', 'Cardiovascular diseases vs. cancer Overall, the evidence for reducing the heart risk from sunbathing is still insufficient – only more extensive and more precise studies can give an answer.']",1,"The first sentence supports a potential short-term reduction in blood pressure with UVA light exposure, but the claim is about cardiovascular disease risk, which requires long-term evidence, as indicated in the second sentence.","It is theoretically conceivable that UVB light could reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. However, studies published so far cannot sufficiently confirm this assumption."
Does the use of laptops with active WLAN (wireless internet access) affect sperm quality in men?,"['However, no such or similar study has been carried out so far – therefore, there is currently no indication for a sperm-damaging effect of WLAN radiation.', 'Conclusion Even though the Argentinean researchers were aware of the heat development by laptops in their WLAN examination and kept the temperature of sperm samples in their glass bowls constantly low – there is no direct evidence of the acute threat to male fertility from the use of laptops – with or without WLAN.']",1,"While the study mentioned in the sentences did not find a direct threat to male fertility from laptop use with or without WLAN, it also did not uncover evidence supporting a sperm-damaging effect of WLAN radiation, leaving the claim unsupported due to a lack of sufficient information.","The underlying study is not sufficiently conclusive to be able to determine such an effect. Currently, there is no high-quality scientific study that has investigated this issue."
Does transcranial direct current stimulation help against severe depression?,"['tDCS therefore shows little success in the treatment of severe depression.', 'While the effect of tDCS is unclear, a number of active substances and psychotherapeutic procedures have been shown to be effective in the treatment of severe depression.']",1,"The first sentence directly refutes the claim by stating that tDCS shows little success in treating severe depression, while the second sentence does not provide clear evidence for or against the claim.","A brand new review shows that tDCS does not lead to lasting improvement in patients with major depression, nor is the response to therapy better than to placebo treatment. However, the number of participants, both overall and in the individual studies, is too low for a reliable assessment."
Does regular use of sleeping pills promote the risk of death or cancer?,"['According to an article in the Kronen newspaper, such sleeping pills are said to be responsible for many deaths.', 'Although the risk of developing cancer was much less increased, the study showed a clear correlation between the intake of more than 130 tablets per year and the risk of developing cancer.', 'The authors of the study suspect that sleeping drugs, for example due to the drowsiness they sometimes cause, can lead to more dangerous falls or fatal accidents.', 'Also a connection with a higher rate of depression among people taking sleeping pills and thus a higher proportion of suicides as a result of depression is not excluded.', 'Although the authors of the study [ 1 ] have ruled out many other diseases as a probable reason for the significantly increased risk of death and cancer, an absolutely safe proof that sleeping agents are the cause of this, they still cannot provide their findings.']",0,"The claim is not definitively supported by the sentences, as the study mentioned does not provide absolute proof that regular use of sleeping pills promotes the risk of death or cancer, but only correlations and suspicions.","There is a connection between the use of sleeping pills and an increased risk of death or cancer. However, it cannot be ruled out with certainty that other reasons are not responsible for this increased risk."
Can exercise improve mental performance impaired by alcohol consumption?,"['Because if these parameters are included in the calculations, the difference between the athletes and the non-sportsmen disappears.']",1,"The sentence suggests that when certain factors are considered, there is no distinction in mental performance between athletes and non-athletes, implying that exercise may not necessarily improve mental performance impaired by alcohol consumption.","There are only two studies that deal with this issue. Only one examines the problem in humans, and that is only a small pilot study. Whether sport reduces alcohol-related brain damage has not been clarified."
Does osteopathy work?,"['Both chronic and acute back pains are common reasons to visit osteopaths, but recent reviews contradict some of the work of 2010 and do not find any reliable efficacy, at least for acute symptoms [2].', 'In chronic complaints, osteopathy is as successful as other therapies, thus comparable to physiotherapy; the effectiveness compared to sham treatment has not been established [3].', 'Other overviews have narrowed the term osteopathy: Paul Posadzki and Edzard Ernst investigated the study situation on efficacy in musculoskeletal pain, but distinguished between chiropractic and osteopathic and analysed only studies on osteopathic therapies [6] : Although aching muscles and joints are virtually the special field of osteopaths, the authors conclude that efficacy is not sufficiently proven; only in five out of 16 studies osteopathy was better than sham treatment.']",0,"While osteopathy shows comparable effectiveness to other therapies for chronic back pain, its superiority over sham treatment for musculoskeletal pain is only proven in a minority of studies, leaving the overall efficacy questionable.","For some therapies that fit under the broad term osteopathy, the evidence of studies indicates efficacy for back pain and some forms of headache; however, evidence of efficacy is lacking for many forms of osteopathy."
"For women at high risk of breast cancer, does a precautionary mastectomy make more sense than regular participation in intensive screening?","['A direct comparison of the methods ""Screening"" and ""Precautionary breast removal"" is not possible on the basis of the current study situation: randomized-controlled studies are unthinkable, because even if the treatments to be compared are similarly effective, a random attribution to a treatment form would of course be unethical.']",1,"The claim cannot be supported or refuted with the current study situation, as randomized-controlled studies comparing screening and precautionary breast removal are unthinkable due to ethical considerations.","High-risk patients can significantly reduce their risk of breast cancer with preventive breast screening. Nevertheless, no general recommendation can be derived from this, as intensive screening programs are an alternative. However, good long-term studies are still lacking for both preventive measures, and the decision can only be made on a very individual basis."
"Does honey work better than other wound treatments for chronic wounds (open leg, diabetic foot)?","['And these are very different for different types of wound, as a summary of the well-made studies published until 2014 shows [1]: Well proven by now, honey can reduce the healing duration of moderate burns – also called second-degree burns, in which the upper skin layers are affected – by an average of four to five days compared to other non-honey-free associations.']",2,"While the claim is specific to chronic wounds like open leg and diabetic foot, the provided sentence only supports honey's effectiveness in reducing healing duration of moderate burns, not chronic wounds.","With honey, moderately severe burns that affect the uppermost layers of the skin and can also lead to wound infections heal four to five days faster than with conventional burn treatments. Whether honey also provides benefits for small, fresh wounds is insufficiently researched. Hard-to-heal (chronic) wounds on legs or feet may not be better treated with honey than with other remedies. There are also indications that honey dressings could lead to more pain here."
Is there a connection between ADHD and neurodermatitis?,"['Jochen Schmitt, Director of the Centre for Evidence-Based Health Care at the University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus Dresden, is attributed in the article to the statement that neurodermatitis increases the risk of ADHD disease by around 50 percent, especially if the disease occurs already in the first two years of life.', 'The probability that a child with previous or current neurodermatitis is diagnosed with ADHD or ADHD symptoms determined from these studies is increased by 43 percent [1].', 'The same team has already described a link between ADHD and neurodermatitis in a systematic review in 2010 [2].', 'A current cross-sectional study from Taiwan [3] also finds a connection in the analysis of data from 8201 ADHD patients, which indicates an approximately 50 percent increased ADHD risk for children with neurodermatitis.', 'Because whether the neurodermatitis actually has a causal effect is unclear – the mechanism that connects the two diseases is unknown, as both Schmitt [1] and the study from Taiwan [3] emphasize.']",0,"The claim is supported by the sentences provided, as multiple sources indicate an increased risk of ADHD in children with neurodermatitis, although the exact causal mechanism remains unclear.",Several large studies show that there is a link between ADHD and neurodermatitis.

However, current evidence for reliable and long-term efficacy is generally lacking, and most remedies are not well studied. It is therefore not possible to lump all products together. Preparations containing the plant ingredient beta-sitosterol, extracts of the African plum tree or ryegrass pollen extract could possibly lead to some improvement - however, this cautious assumption is based on outdated data. However, the current finding is this: remedies containing saw palmetto do not work any better than placebo and are thus considered ineffective."
Do milk or dairy products promote prostate cancer?,"['Intestinal cancer and bladder cancer risk reduced For some types of cancer, the consumption of large amounts of milk and dairy products seems to be able to reduce the risk of cancer.', 'Men who claimed to have consumed a great deal of milk and dairy products have, over the years, been less likely to have these types of cancer than men who had little milk-containing food.', 'At least for cancer in the colon and the rectum, the results show a direct connection with the amount of milk product: the more milk and dairy products the study participants consumed, the greater the protection effect.', 'A potentially increased prostate risk due to very high milk and dairy consumption is thus opposed to a likely reduction in the risk of colorectal cancer.', 'There is also the possibility that dairy products will reduce the likelihood of bladder cancer.']",0,"While some studies suggest milk and dairy products may lower the risk of certain cancers, they do not refute the possibility of a potential increased prostate cancer risk due to high consumption, as indicated in the claim.","It is likely that dairy products reduce the risk of colon and rectal cancer, and possibly bladder cancer. However, very large amounts of milk & dairy products could possibly increase the risk of prostate cancer. It should be remembered that about the same number of men die from colon and rectal cancer as from prostate cancer. For breast and ovarian cancer and cancer of the endometrium, it is unclear whether cancer risk is affected by milk and dairy products."
Can arthroscopy reduce pain or improve mobility?,"['Studies clearly speak against a benefit A research team summarized the most meaningful of all previously published studies on arthroscopy in knee arthritis.', 'In these studies, patients treated after arthroscopy had no noticeably less pain or movement restrictions than those treated only for appearance or not at all.', 'Arthroscopy against osteoarthritis: not effective, but also not very risky After all: Undesirable events were not conspicuously common in the arthroscopy groups either.']",2,"The claim that arthroscopy can reduce pain or improve mobility is refuted by the studies mentioned, which found no significant difference in pain or movement restrictions between patients who underwent arthroscopy and those who did not.",The data are clear: Arthroscopy is useless as a treatment for knee osteoarthritis. It can neither relieve pain nor improve the function of the knee joint in the long term.
Do health benefits increase with duration and intensity of exercise?,"['==References==<br> According to their calculations, 75 minutes of brisk walking a week can extend life by 1.8 years.', 'In both normal and overweight people, mortality decreased when the researchers compared slightly active (equivalent to approximately 140 minutes of brisk walking per week) with inactive people.', 'In this study, too, a gain in years of life was calculated, but here in relation to the time of birth: Compared to inactive people, slight activity prolongs life by 0.7 years.', '150 minutes of physical activity per week reduced mortality by around 9 percent.', 'less than 150 minutes per week, can reduce their risk of death by around 34% compared to inactive people.']",0,"The sentences provide evidence that increased duration of exercise, such as brisk walking, can lead to a reduction in mortality and an extension of life, supporting the claim.","Several major studies have consistently concluded that physical activity reduces mortality. Even a brisk walk is enough. More helps more - but in any case, some exercise is much better than none at all."
