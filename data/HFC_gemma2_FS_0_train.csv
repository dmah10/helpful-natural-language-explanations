Can masks reduce corona infections when worn by a large proportion of the population?,"['Studies show slow spread After three years of pandemic, there are now relatively meaningful data that masks can slow down the spread of the Corona virus.', 'Surgical masks, in turn, seem to reduce the risk of infecting themselves with the corona virus.']",0,"The provided sentences suggest that masks can slow the spread of the corona virus, but they do not explicitly state whether this effect is significant enough when a large proportion of the population wears them.  
","International studies suggest that the number of corona infections decreases when many people wear masks - whether fabric, surgical or FFP2 masks. However, it is not possible to precisely quantify how great the protective effect actually is. It probably depends on the type of masks and the proportion of people who wear them."
Can homeopathic preparations with Anamirta cocculus help against dizziness?,"['But without success: We could not find any meaningful scientific evidence for effectiveness in dizziness.', 'It is now well proven by studies that homeopathic preparations usually do not work better than a sham medication (placebo) [8].', 'However, it is not well established that betahistine is effective against dizziness [11.13].', 'The fact that betahist helps with dizziness is not well documented [11, 13].']",1,"The provided sentences state that there is no scientific evidence to support the effectiveness of homeopathic preparations for dizziness.

Can glutamate in food cause intolerance symptoms?,"['There are many case reports of an alleged glutamate hypersensitivity, but these can hardly be verified.', 'But among the alleged glutamate-sensitive subjects there was no one who showed symptoms after all glutamate [3].', 'The available studies show that up to three grams of glutamate does not cause symptoms in a selected group of healthy individuals.']",1,"While some individuals report symptoms after consuming glutamate, scientific studies have not found consistent evidence to support a link between dietary glutamate and intolerance.  
","There is no conclusive evidence that the consumption of glutamate triggers complaints. However, since studies conducted to date have shown deficiencies, it cannot be ruled out that there are isolated individuals who react sensitively to large amounts of glutamate."
Is it harmful for the mental development of the unborn child if the mother regularly eats fish contaminated with mercury during pregnancy?,"['For previous studies suggest that the consumption of larger amounts of mercury-containing fish could slightly affect the mental performance of the offspring [1, 2, 3].', 'The studies in detail The fact that methyl mercury can damage the brain of unborn children already in concentrations in which the pregnant mothers themselves do not notice any symptoms is beyond question [6].', 'In investigations into the Faroe Islands and New Zealand, the assumption was confirmed: expectant mothers with high mercury levels were given children, whose mental performance was on average slightly worse in later tests than that of unloaded mothers – the mercury levels of the mothers were mostly so high, because they had consumed large amounts of contaminated fish before and during pregnancy.', 'Impact on the IQ Despite these contradictions, the consumption of contaminated fish seems to reduce the intelligence of the offspring measurable, although it is not yet clear how much.', ""A research team at Harvard University calculated an average reduction in the intelligence ratio of 0.7 points for each micrograms of mercury in mother's hair [2] in the analysis of studies from the Faroe Islands, Seychelles and New Zealand.""]",0,"Several studies indicate a correlation between maternal mercury consumption from fish and slightly reduced mental performance in offspring.

Can the consumption of caffeine during pregnancy harm the unborn child?,"['However, the study showed that it made no difference whether the participants drank around three cups of caffeine or decaffeinated coffee.', ""On average, the weight of birth at birth was about the same, was similar in size and was not more frequently born too early even after the mother's caffeine consumption."", 'Similar to the summary of the Cochrane overview work: In early pregnancy three cups of coffee daily would have no effect on birth weight, growth or premature birth [2].']",1,"The provided sentences suggest that consuming around three cups of caffeine daily during pregnancy does not appear to have a negative impact on birth weight, size, or the likelihood of premature birth.  
",There is insufficient evidence that moderate consumption of caffeinated beverages would have a negative impact on the child's development. Up to three cups of coffee a day does not appear to reduce the child's birth weight. Very large amounts of caffeine-containing beverages could possibly contribute to lower birth weight.
Can garlic extract reduce high blood pressure and thus the risk of cardiovascular disease?,"['Two better performed randomised-controlled studies provide cautious evidence that garlic can lower too high blood pressure [1].', 'However, even the results of these two studies are insufficiently valid for a clear assessment [1].', 'Whether garlic taken regularly can lower too high blood pressure and thus lower the risk of cardiovascular disease remains unclear for the time being.', 'At least in theory, there may also be interactions with anticoagulant drugs or side effects in persons with a tendency to bleed, as garlic is suspected to have an anticoagulant effect.']",1,"While some studies suggest garlic might lower blood pressure, the evidence is limited and further research is needed to determine its impact on cardiovascular disease risk.
