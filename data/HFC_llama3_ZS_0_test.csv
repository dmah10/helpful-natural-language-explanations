Does paxlovid protect unvaccinated people with risk factors from severe or even fatal covid 19 disease?,"['Patients at risk without corona vaccination appear to be well protected from serious to fatal events by Paxlovid.', 'However, it is not certain how well Paxlovid helps people who have already received corona vaccination.', 'In addition, the scientists investigated whether Paxlovid alleviated the Covid-19 symptoms, shortened the duration of the disease and reduced the need for medical treatment: Half of the participants improved the symptoms with Paxlovid after 13 days, with placebo after 15 days.', 'With Paxlovid, 14 out of 1000 participants needed medical treatment for Covid-19 within a month, with placebo 76 out of 1000.', 'Whether with or without antibodies in the blood, Paxlovid basically protected all humans from a severe course.']",0,"The claim that Paxlovid protects unvaccinated people with risk factors from severe or even fatal Covid-19 disease is supported by the statement that ""Patients at risk without corona vaccination appear to be well protected from serious to fatal events by Paxlovid"" and the data showing that Paxlovid reduced the need for medical treatment in this group.","In a large, well-done study, paxlovid prevented hospitalizations and deaths in high-risk patients. They were unvaccinated and had contracted the delta variant. For vaccinated people, the benefit cannot be reliably estimated. This also applies to people with immunodeficiency."
Does the consumption of soy foods or soy isoflavones affect the appearance of acne skin?,"['In both cases, certain soya ingredients are responsible for the effect on the skin: the isoflavones.', 'There are two competing theories that contradict each other: according to the first theory, isoflavones confuse the hormone balance and are supposed to promote acne in this way.', 'Surprisingly, despite searching in two large databases, we could not find a study on soy products and acne – whether soy milk, soy sauce or tofu.', 'The isoflavones improved the skin appearance more than an anti-acne cream with vitamin A acid (Tretinoin).', 'Conclusion: There is currently no evidence from reliable studies that soy makes acne worse.']",1,"The claim that soy consumption affects acne skin is uncertain due to the lack of reliable studies on the topic, despite some theories suggesting isoflavones may promote acne, while others show they can even improve skin appearance.","We could not find any meaningful studies at all on the influence of soy foods on acne. On soy isoflavones, we found two small studies of questionable quality that examined a very specific group of sufferers. Soy isoflavones improved the skin appearance somewhat. However, this result is not reliable."
Does regular HPV testing in addition to the recommended Pap smear detect more precancerous lesions than just the Pap smear alone?,"['According to the studies, the HPV test is likely to detect slightly more precursors of cervical cancer over several years than the PAP swab alone.', 'We are therefore relatively sure that with an additional HPV test at least a little more precursors of uterine cancer are detected than only with the PAP swab alone.']",0,"The claim that regular HPV testing in addition to the recommended Pap smear detects more precancerous lesions than just the Pap smear alone is supported by the sentences, which suggest that the HPV test is likely to detect slightly more precursors of cervical cancer over time than the Pap smear alone.","Regular examination of the cervix by means of PAP smear tests detects precancerous stages of the cervix in most cases in good time. This reduces the risk of developing cervical cancer. An additional HPV test every three to five years can make screening even more reliable. However, the difference should not be too great."
Can olive leaf extract reduce high blood pressure?,"['These studies therefore do not indicate whether olive leaf extract can help with significantly increased blood pressure.', 'Without success, however, we could not find any studies that investigated the effect of olive leaf extract on cardiovascular health.', 'However, they cannot provide clear answers.', 'It is therefore impossible to say whether olive leaves extract could have a better or worse effect with significantly increased blood pressure.']",1,"The claim that olive leaf extract can reduce high blood pressure remains uncertain due to the lack of studies investigating its effect on cardiovascular health, making it impossible to determine its potential impact on significantly increased blood pressure.","Whether olive leaf extract lowers blood pressure has been investigated in five suitable studies to date. They all found no effect or only a slight effect of the extract. The problem with this is that most of the study participants had only slightly elevated blood pressure. They cannot answer how olive leaf extract works in people with significantly elevated blood pressure (hypertension). The studies also had gross flaws, few participants, and ran for a very short time. They cannot provide reliable answers."
Do green-lipped mussel preparations improve the symptoms of osteoarthritis?,"['Studies overall not meaningful The conclusion of our research: Scientific evidence for the claimed effect is missing.', 'It is also unclear whether the measured positive effects are large enough to actually be felt by those affected.', 'Whether or not green-lipped mussel helps with osteoarthritis cannot be said at the moment.', 'However, as early as 2009, the European Food Safety Authority considered that a protective effect of the green-lipped mussel on healthy joints has not been established.', 'In our opinion, no reliable conclusions can be drawn from the studies found.']",1,"The claim that green-lipped mussel preparations improve osteoarthritis symptoms lacks conclusive evidence, as the existing studies are deemed not meaningful, and their measured effects are unclear, leaving the effectiveness of green-lipped mussel in osteoarthritis treatment uncertain.","The question was examined in four small studies with serious methodological deficiencies, which also arrived at partly contradictory results. No clear conclusions can be drawn from them. The claim that green-lipped mussel helps with osteoarthritis is not scientifically proven."
Can laser irradiation of blood by infusion needle (hemolaser treatment) relieve discomfort or help with diseases?,"['It is also unclear by what mechanism blood irradiation with bundled red light – i.e.', 'red laser – should improve health.', 'Although the authors of the three studies found [1-3] claim to have established a clear efficacy of haemolaser treatment, none of the three studies is suitable to prove this.']",1,The claim that hemolaser treatment can relieve discomfort or help with diseases is questionable because the mechanism behind its supposed benefits is unclear and the existing studies claiming its efficacy are methodologically flawed.,There is no scientific evidence that hemolaser treatment has a palliative or curative effect on health problems.
Can CBD help with period pain?,"['Because despite searching in three different databases we could not find a single study on CBD in case of regular pain.', 'Scientifically, it is not sufficiently researched whether CBD actually promotes sleep, as providers claim.', 'The studies in detail We could not find any studies that investigated whether CBD can help with normal pain – neither for treatment nor for prevention.']",1,"The claim that CBD can help with period pain lacks conclusive evidence as there are no studies found that investigate CBD's effect on regular pain, including menstrual pain.",Whether CBD can relieve menstrual pain has apparently never been scientifically studied. We could not find any studies on this. Women who suffer from severe period pain should talk to a gynecologist about it. Diseases such as endometriosis could be behind it.
"Does the Zisano bracelet strengthen the immune system, increase endurance and performance or reduce fatigue?","['Whether such bracelets have an effect, for example whether they can actually increase physical performance or strengthen the immune system, has apparently never been investigated.', 'Bracelets for more performance: studies show ineffectiveness All five studies came to the same conclusion: the bracelets had no effect on the performance or well-being of the subjects.', 'A scientifically plausible explanation as to how exactly such bracelets should develop their effect remains to be found in their suppliers.', 'The studies in detail We could not find any studies on the Zisano bracelet or comparable bracelets with silicon chip.']",1,"The claim that the Zisano bracelet strengthens the immune system, increases endurance and performance, or reduces fatigue is unsubstantiated as there is no scientific evidence to support its effectiveness, with multiple studies finding no correlation between the bracelet and improved performance or well-being.","The promised positive effects of the ""Powerband"" wristband on health and well-being have apparently not been scientifically studied. We could not find any studies on this. It is also unclear how the wristband is supposed to work in concrete terms. A scientifically plausible explanation is missing."
"Does microimmunotherapy improve symptoms of allergies, cancer, joint inflammation, autoimmune diseases, dementia or various viral infections?","['None of these studies are meaningful – because they are poorly carried out and the published data are incomplete.', 'They cannot give any indication of the benefits of microimmune therapy.', 'Entitled doubts Since microimmune therapy preparations are highly diluted as homeopathic agents, we have fundamental doubts about the method.']",1,"The claim that microimmunotherapy improves symptoms of various diseases is refuted by the expert's criticism that the studies are poorly carried out, lack complete data, and are fundamentally doubtful due to the highly diluted nature of the therapy preparations.","So far, studies seem to exist only on microimmunotherapy against hay fever and cancer. Their significance is far too low to conclude that the therapy is effective. We found no studies on other health problems. Thus, there is no proven benefit of microimmunotherapy for any disease."
Does transcranial pulse stimulation (TPS) improve mental performance in people with Alzheimer's dementia? Can the treatment improve the quality of life of those affected?,"['Therefore, we do not consider the study results to be meaningful.', ""Transcranial pulse stimulation: not recognized as Alzheimer's therapy Even if providers of transcranial pulse stimulation claim otherwise: as therapy, the treatment with ultrasound in dementia is neither researched nor recognized."", 'There are currently no studies that can prove that it can help people with dementia in the short term or in the long term.', 'None of the studies can answer whether transcranial pulse stimulation or similar procedures help people with dementia.']",1,"The claim that transcranial pulse stimulation improves mental performance and quality of life in people with Alzheimer's dementia is not supported by existing studies, as they are deemed unconvincing and unable to provide conclusive evidence of its effectiveness.",Whether transcranial pulse stimulation can help people with Alzheimer's dementia has not yet been investigated in meaningful studies. Possible harmful effects have also been insufficiently researched.
Does CBD (cannabidiol) relieve symptoms of mild to moderate covid-19 disease?,"[""We can't say with absolute certainty that CBD is ineffective at Covid-19, but we think it is reasonably probable."", 'In addition, there is evidence from other studies that CBD may even increase the susceptibility to infection [4].', 'Although she appears in some media reports, the report is simply wrong that the researchers had demonstrated an anti-corona effect of CBD in their study: According to the research team, CBD had no effect on the corona virus in the experiments.', 'No benefit from CBD After 28 days, the study team took stock: Overall, the participants of the CBD group felt no better than those of the placebo group.']",2,"The claim that CBD relieves symptoms of mild to moderate Covid-19 disease is disputed by the study's findings, which suggest that CBD had no effect on the coronavirus and may even increase susceptibility to infection, and ultimately, the participants who received CBD did not feel better than those who received a placebo.","CBD is unlikely to have any effect on the symptoms of covid-19 disease. This is the conclusion of the only study that has investigated this. However, its validity is somewhat limited due to the small number of participants. Not explored is a possible preventive effect. It is unclear whether CBD or other cannabis constituents - ingested or smoked - protect against corona infection or covid-19 disease."
Do infusions of vitamin C relieve symptoms of chronic fatigue or long covid?,"['It is also unclear whether people with Long Covid benefit from vitamin C infusions.', 'One of the two authors is also an employee of a pharmaceutical company that also offers products with vitamin C.  Since the developmental mechanisms of both chronic fatigue syndrome and long covid are unclear, studies with cancer patients or healthy participants cannot provide answers to the question whether vitamin C can help people with chronic fatigue syndrome or long covid.']",1,"The claim that vitamin C infusions relieve symptoms of chronic fatigue or long covid remains uncertain due to the unclear developmental mechanisms of these conditions and the lack of relevant studies, making it impossible to draw conclusions from existing research on cancer patients or healthy participants.",Whether vitamin C infusions help with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is questionable. This has not yet been scientifically investigated. We also could not find a single study on vitamin C and fatigue occurring in the context of Long Covid.
Does mistletoe therapy help against cancer or can it improve the quality of life of cancer patients?,"['It is currently unclear whether cancer sufferers live longer or better due to mistletoe therapy.', 'No longer survival time detectable The analysis of the previously published survival studies [1] shows that overall mistletoe therapy does not seem to be able to prolong the lifetime of cancer patients.', 'In order to prove this, meaningful studies are still missing – even after about a hundred years.The studies in detail We looked for overviews in three different databases, which summarize the current study situation on mistletoe therapy in cancer.']",1,"The claim that mistletoe therapy helps against cancer or improves the quality of life of cancer patients is uncertain because current studies fail to demonstrate a significant impact on survival time, and more research is needed to determine its effectiveness.","Mistletoe therapy for cancer has been investigated in some studies. However, these are very poor and come to inconsistent results. They cannot prove that mistletoe therapy is effective. In addition, there is a suspicion that mistletoe preparations may even stimulate tumor growth in some types of cancer."
Can regular exercise prevent you from getting a cold or other respiratory infections???,"['People who practice sports on a regular basis are likely to suffer as often from respiratory infections as sports muffles.', 'The studies suggest that although the number of infections can not be reduced by sport, it may be a little milder for the duration of the disease and for the duration of the disease as a whole.']",2,"The claim that regular exercise can prevent respiratory infections is refuted by the sentences, which suggest that exercise does not reduce the frequency of infections, but may only make their duration and severity slightly milder.","Previous studies suggest that sports-playing people may be just as likely to have respiratory infections as sports-muffle people. However, the illnesses are likely to be somewhat less severe and a bit shorter overall."
Does coenzyme Q10 relieve muscle discomfort during treatment with statins?,"['In seven studies, the coenzyme Q10 group was no better than the placebo group.', 'When the research team removed this study from the overall evaluation, the remaining studies came together to a relatively similar result: Coenzyme Q10 does not help better than a sham medication.']",1,"The claim that coenzyme Q10 relieves muscle discomfort during treatment with statins is challenged by the findings that the coenzyme Q10 group showed no significant difference from the placebo group in seven studies, and even when an outlier study was removed, the remaining studies still failed to demonstrate a significant benefit.","Several studies come to contradictory results. In addition, the range of variation in the estimated effect is very large, and the individual studies have certain shortcomings. On this basis, no firm conclusions can be drawn."
Can taking vitamin C after the onset of a cold relieve symptoms or shorten the illness?,"['Symptom treatment probably without effect The recommendation to take high-dose vitamin C at the first signs of a cold cannot be confirmed by studies.', 'The combined results of previous studies do not show that vitamin C can relieve cold symptoms.']",2,The claim that taking vitamin C after the onset of a cold can relieve symptoms or shorten the illness is disputed by studies that found no evidence to support the effectiveness of high-dose vitamin C in alleviating cold symptoms.,"Preventive intake of high-dose vitamin C for a long time does not prevent the occurrence of colds. However, it can reduce the average duration of illness by half a day to a day from a week. Vitamin C is unlikely to improve a cold that has already occurred."
Can taking spermidine prolong life? Can it prevent diseases?,"['Whether spermidine absorbed by food or as a capsule has a life-extending effect in humans, such attempts cannot answer – man differs too much from worms and flies.', 'Spermidine from capsules: unexplored However, we have found no studies at all on the life-prolonging effect of spermidine as a dietary supplement.']",1,"The claim that taking spermidine can prolong life and prevent diseases is uncertain because there is a lack of studies on the life-prolonging effect of spermidine as a dietary supplement in humans, and it is unclear whether results from animal studies can be applied to humans.","No study has yet investigated whether spermidine in the form of dietary supplements helps people live longer or healthier. There are two observational studies on the influence of a spermidine-rich diet on life expectancy. However, their results are not conclusive."
Can green tea protect against coronavirus infection or help treat covid-19?,"['Thus, it cannot be proven (or ruled out) that green tea protects against Corona infection or can relieve covid-19 disease.', 'Whether the green tea substances concentrate sufficiently in those body cells that are infected by the corona virus is also unclear.', 'We have described what we know about the effectiveness of Gurgel solutions against SARS-CoV-2 in our own article.The studies in detail We have not found any studies that have investigated the effects of green tea on patients with Covid-19.']",1,The claim that green tea can protect against coronavirus infection or help treat covid-19 is uncertain because the concentration of green tea substances in infected body cells is unclear and no studies have been found that investigate its effects on covid-19 patients.,"So far, this has not been verified in studies with humans. Such an effect is therefore unclear."
Does vitamin D alleviate autism symptoms in children?,"['But we could not find any evidence of positive effects on autism.', 'Medicines for the treatment of autism-typical symptoms do not exist [9].The studies in detail We wanted to know whether vitamin D can alleviate the most important symptoms of autism: Are there any improvements in social and communication behaviour?', 'The combined results [1] of the two studies [10.11] do not indicate that vitamin D can improve communication or rigid, repetitive behavioural patterns, whether alone or in combination with omega-3 fatty acids.', 'Overall, the results of the four studies do not give a solid indication that vitamin D helps children with autism.', 'Since only a few children have participated, the results are hardly comparable and partly contradict each other, the significance of the previous studies is small – that is, we can neither prove nor exclude a positive effect.']",1,"The claim that vitamin D alleviates autism symptoms in children is uncertain due to the inconsistent and limited results of previous studies, which failed to demonstrate a significant positive effect on social and communication behavior, and rigid, repetitive behavioral patterns.","Studies on the subject are sparse and inconclusive. Even if individual studies claim to have observed positive effects, their results are unclear and contradictory. A strong improvement of autism symptoms was not shown in any of the previous studies."
Does glutathione improve the tolerability of chemotherapy for cancer?,"['Therefore, we cannot make statements about glutathione as a dietary supplement for swallowing, the effect of glutathione in other chemotherapys (without platinum) or in relation to other side effects.', 'Therefore, our conclusion: We cannot confirm or exclude that glutathione infusions mitigate or prevent nerve damage as a side effect of platinum-containing chemotherapy.', 'Thus, no conclusions can be drawn about the potential later use of glutathione.']",1,"The claim that glutathione improves the tolerability of chemotherapy for cancer is uncertain due to the limitations of the study, which only examined platinum-containing chemotherapy and did not provide conclusive evidence on glutathione's effect on nerve damage or other side effects.","Eight studies have examined whether glutathione can mitigate or prevent nerve damage during platinum-containing chemotherapy. But unfortunately, they do not allow reliable conclusions to be drawn: The studies were rather small, used different measurement tools, and came to contradictory results."
"Does amygdalin, the toxin from the seeds of apricots and other stone fruits, help against cancer?","['Unscientific myth In fact, there is no evidence of a cancer healing or preventive effect.', 'We do not know any meaningful study in which the anti-cancer effect of apricots or the amygdalin contained therein has been investigated [1].', 'So there is no evidence of an effect against cancer.']",1,"The claim that amygdalin helps against cancer is unsubstantiated as there is no evidence from meaningful studies to support its anti-cancer effect, and existing information suggests it has no cancer healing or preventive effect.","It is a myth that eating bitter apricot seeds can cure or prevent cancer. Instead, it has been proven that the amygdalin contained in them is toxic. Eating bitter apricot seeds can cause severe poisoning, sometimes fatal."
Does garlic protect against a cold (chill)??,"['Small study, no safety In terms of cold (""cooling""), we found only one evaluable study, which was relatively small [1].']",1,"The claim that garlic protects against a cold is uncertain due to the limited availability of evidence, as only one small study was found that evaluated its effectiveness in preventing cooling.","We could not find a single meaningful study on the protective effect of garlic against Corona infections. There is no scientific basis for such claims. On the question of whether garlic protects against colds, we were able to evaluate only one study. However, this is relatively small and has gross weaknesses. The supposedly positive result is therefore not reliable."
"Does colloidal silver (""silver water"") work against infection with the coronavirus or other pathogens? Does it have any other health benefits?","['Whether drinking colloidal silver can do something about pathogens such as coronavirus has never been seriously investigated.', 'However, it cannot be concluded that colloidal silver also acts against pathogens in the human body.', 'And even if: Whether the silver concentration there would be sufficiently high to kill pathogens on the one hand and at the same time not cause serious side effects is also questionable.']",1,"The claim that colloidal silver is effective against coronavirus or other pathogens is unsubstantiated due to a lack of serious investigation, and even if it were effective, it's uncertain whether the concentration would be sufficient to kill pathogens without causing side effects.","Whether colloidal silver can cure infections with the coronavirus and other diseases or has a preventive effect has never been investigated in meaningful studies. Claims about the effectiveness of silver water are therefore made up out of thin air. What is certain, however, is that colloidal silver can discolor the skin blue-gray when the metal particle solution is drunk."
Is whole-body vibration therapy effective in preventing bone fractures in osteoporosis sufferers?,"['However, we could not find a single study in which researchers evaluated whether osteoporosis suffers from rare (or frequent) bone fractures with vibration training.', 'Read more about osteoporosis on the pages of Gesundheitsinformation.de [4].The studies in detail We could not find any studies that investigated whether vibration training is effective to reduce the risk of bone fractures in people with osteoporosis.', 'The review therefore does not allow any direct conclusions on the risk of bone fracture in osteoporosis.']",1,"The claim that whole-body vibration therapy is effective in preventing bone fractures in osteoporosis sufferers lacks conclusive evidence, as no studies have been found that directly investigate the relationship between vibration training and bone fracture risk in people with osteoporosis.","We did not find any studies that investigated whether vibration training affects the risk of bone fractures in people with osteoporosis. Therefore, we cannot make an assessment."
"Does the product ""BestProvita Diabetin"" improve blood glucose levels in type 2 diabetes or does it prevent secondary diseases?","['Disappointing result Our research in three scientific literature databases was quite fast in the sand for the preparation ""BestProvita Diabetin: We did not find a single study that would have tested a food supplement with this composition.', 'So whether the capsules have the promised effect cannot be assessed.']",1,"The claim that ""BestProvita Diabetin"" improves blood glucose levels in type 2 diabetes or prevents secondary diseases cannot be supported or refuted due to the lack of scientific studies testing the product's composition, leaving its effectiveness unassessed.","Neither for the product ""BestProvita Diabetin"" nor for the particularly touted ingredient blueberry could we find meaningful studies."
Do blueberries improve blood sugar levels in type 2 diabetes or do they prevent secondary diseases?,"['No ""blue miracle"" Similarly disappointing ended our search for the benefit of blueberries in type 2 diabetes: The scientific literature cited by the provider on his website is not particularly meaningful for the alleged benefit.', 'We could not find a single meaningful study on blueberry in type 2 diabetes.', 'Whether blueberries in type 2 diabetes actually improve metabolism or protect against consequential damage, we cannot therefore assess.', 'This also applies to studies on blueberry – we could not discover well-made studies on a positive effect for diabetics.']",1,The claim that blueberries improve blood sugar levels in type 2 diabetes or prevent secondary diseases is unsubstantiated due to the lack of meaningful studies and scientific literature supporting this alleged benefit.,"Neither for the product ""BestProvita Diabetin"" nor for the particularly touted ingredient blueberry could we find meaningful studies."
Does hydroxychloroquine reduce the likelihood of dying from covid-19 disease?,"['On the contrary, the study results leave open the possibility that hydroxychloroquine even slightly increases the risk of death.', 'For prevention and treatment useless Both analyses [1,2] come to the sobering result: The fact that hydroxychloroquine reduces the risk of death by Covid-19 is almost impossible.', 'The same conclusion was also made by a comprehensive review of Cochrane Collaboration [4]: The nine randomized controlled studies included in it also show no effect of hydroxychloroquine on the risk of dying of Covid-19.']",2,"The claim that hydroxychloroquine reduces the likelihood of dying from covid-19 disease is contradicted by the study results and comprehensive reviews, which suggest that it may even increase the risk of death or has no effect on the risk of dying from Covid-19.","The results of all studies to date preclude hydroxychloroquine from preventing deaths in covid-19 patients. The drug also does not appear to attenuate the disease. A preventive effect is also unlikely, according to the study results. It is well documented that hydroxychloroquine has side effects. Among other things, the drug can damage the heart and kidneys."
"Can Medistus Antivirus Lozenges protect against colds, flu, covid-19, or other respiratory infections?","['However, we could not find any scientific evidence of the claimed protective effect.', 'So it remains unclear for us whether Medistus Antivirus can actually protect against viruses and other pathogens.', 'However, we find transparent information important – for example for allergy sufferers.The studies in detail In our extensive search in three scientific databases, we did not find any studies on the efficacy of the product Medistus Antivirus or the alleged active substance ""Kistosyn 200"" contained in it.']",1,"The claim that Medistus Antivirus Lozenges can protect against colds, flu, covid-19, or other respiratory infections is uncertain due to the lack of scientific evidence supporting its efficacy, as no studies were found to substantiate the product's claimed protective effect.","There are no published studies that have verified the effectiveness of the lozenges. The manufacturers also do not reveal what is behind the alleged active ingredient ""Kistosyn 200"". We are therefore unable to judge whether an effect is plausible."
Does gargling with hydrogen peroxide have health risks?,"['This means that we cannot say whether hydrogen peroxide gurgles can prevent or alleviate diseases and what long-term side effects there may be.', 'The undesirable consequences of long-term daily gurgling with hydrogen peroxide for the oral mucosa have never been scientifically investigated.', 'Significant studies on potential risks or long-term damage caused by regular rinsing and gurgling with hydrogen peroxide are also missing.']",1,The claim that gargling with hydrogen peroxide has health risks is uncertain due to the lack of scientific investigation into its long-term effects on the oral mucosa and potential risks or damage.,"Whether hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as a gargle solution is suitable to treat or prevent COVID-19, sore throats or colds has never been scientifically studied. Neither has whether regular use is harmful. However, if hydrogen peroxide is swallowed or inhaled, there may be health consequences."
"Do dental care products with nanoparticles of hydroxyapatite help pain-sensitive teeth? And can they prevent caries or repair already affected, decayed tooth enamel?","['However, the examination is so poor that it cannot show to what extent caries can be prevented by hydroxyapatite tooth care.', 'Whether existing mild caries with hydroxyapatite disappear again is not investigated at all in studies.', 'Many questions open It is not only unclear at the moment whether hydroxyapatite helps against pain sensitivity of the teeth or caries.', 'All in all, the study cannot show that hydroxylapatite can prevent caries.']",1,"The claim that dental care products with nanoparticles of hydroxyapatite help pain-sensitive teeth and prevent or repair caries is uncertain due to the lack of conclusive evidence, as the existing studies have poor examination and fail to investigate the effectiveness of hydroxyapatite in preventing caries or repairing decayed tooth enamel.","On these questions, we found only inadequate studies with no explanatory power.

Can light therapy with light lamps relieve the symptoms of autumn-winter depression?,"['Overall, these results show that treatment with light bulbs could help some people affected by fall-winter depression at least in the short term.', 'After two to eight weeks of long treatment, the symptoms improved in 25 out of 100 people without light therapy.Light therapy improved in 46 out of 100 people Overall, light therapy helped 21 out of 100 people.', 'Thus, the best available studies suggest that light therapy can help some people.']",0,"The claim that light therapy with light lamps can relieve the symptoms of autumn-winter depression is supported by the results of studies showing that light therapy improved symptoms in 46 out of 100 people, which is a significant increase from the 25 out of 100 people who improved without light therapy.","Light therapy with light lamps may be able to relieve fall-winter depression. However, it seems to help only one in five affected people. It is unclear how long an improvement lasts. Long-term studies are lacking."
Does deuterium-reduced water prevent cancer?,"['No statements can be derived from this on other cancers or even on protection against cancer.', ""Unreliable For patients with prostate cancer, a benefit of deuterium-reduced water cannot be safely demonstrated with the study found, even if the author's team reports otherwise.""]",1,"The claim that deuterium-reduced water prevents cancer is not supported by the study, as it only reports on prostate cancer and even then, the results are unreliable and do not demonstrate a clear benefit.","We found only one study with prostate cancer patients comparing deuterium-reduced water with normal water. This small study has numerous flaws, so the results are not conclusive. We were unable to locate reliable studies on its use in other cancers or for cancer prevention."
Can cosmetic products with caffeine for hair and scalp help against hereditary hair loss?,"['Likewise, we did not find any studies on the effect of caffeine in other forms of hair loss.', 'Whether caffeine shampoo and co. work in practice can therefore not be answered on the basis of these results.', 'What really does it do to wash your hair with caffeine shampoo and use other cosmetic products with caffeine, however, is unclear.', 'We do not consider this result to be trustworthy.']",1,"The claim that cosmetic products with caffeine can help against hereditary hair loss is uncertain because the available results do not provide conclusive evidence on the effectiveness of caffeine in hair loss prevention, and the existing studies are deemed untrustworthy.","Caffeine can penetrate the hair root and prolong the hair growth phase there - at least if the hair loss is hereditary (androgenetic alopecia). At least, this is what studies from the laboratory indicate. Whether caffeine shampoo or other cosmetic products containing caffeine help women and men with hereditary hair loss is not yet clear. Reliable research is still lacking."
Is music therapy with rhythmic training helpful for people with Parkinson's who have trouble walking?,"['Rhythmic walking training: Possible small improvement There are many forms of music therapy.', 'It suggests that rhythmic training could slightly increase walking speed.', 'The average effect, however, does not seem to be particularly large: without rhythmic training, the participants went about 56.5 meters per minute With rhythmic training, the participants went about 60 meters per minute After the training, the participants travelled about 3.5 meters more per minute [1].']",0,"The claim that music therapy with rhythmic training is helpful for people with Parkinson's who have trouble walking is supported by the finding that rhythmic training slightly increases walking speed, with participants traveling 3.5 meters more per minute on average after the training.","Music therapy with rhythmic training could help Parkinson's sufferers walk a little faster and more safely. However, the effect is unlikely to be very great."
Do preparations with unsaponifiable components of avocado and soybean oils (ASU) help against limitations and pain in osteoarthritis of the knee joint?,"['The study team reports that in some of the subjects the pain and movement restrictions improved a little – in those with a knee arthritis and only a maximum of 6 months observation period.', 'In case of osteoarthritis in the knee, preparations with avocado and soya oil can probably alleviate the discomfort – at least in the short term.', 'Participants with knee arthrosis were likely to benefit from the therapy – and to a noticeable extent.']",0,"The claim that ASU preparations help against limitations and pain in osteoarthritis of the knee joint is supported by the sentences, which suggest that such preparations can alleviate discomfort and improve movement restrictions in knee arthritis patients, at least in the short term.",There is evidence of minor efficacy of preparations containing avocado and soybean oil (ASU). They can probably somewhat alleviate movement restrictions and pain in osteoarthritis of the knee joint - at least in the short term. An effect in osteoarthritis of the hip joint has not yet been shown. Side effects are not to be expected.
"Does ""Detoxic"" work against tapeworms and other parasites?

Can Neuro-Socks relieve pain or improve balance and stability?,"['Thus, how the neuro-socks should relieve pain or promote stability and strength through touch stimuli on the sole of the foot was not comprehensible to us on the usual research path.', 'However, when we look more closely, it quickly becomes clear from our point of view that these studies have no significance.', 'However, the evaluation is incomplete and does not allow any conclusions.', 'Since essential information on the course of the study is missing, this result is neither comprehensible nor trustworthy.']",1,"The claim that Neuro-Socks can relieve pain or improve balance and stability is uncertain due to the lack of comprehensible and trustworthy evidence, as the provided studies are incomplete, lack essential information, and have no significance.",There is no scientific evidence of such an effect.
Does the osteoporosis drug teriparatide increase the risk of bone cancer as a side effect?,"['However, in these studies [1-4] there was no clear association between teriparatide treatment and osteosarcoma disease.', 'Many questions open Therefore, it is not clear at this stage whether teriparatide actually increases the risk of osteosarcoma and how large this effect may be.', 'No association between treatment with teriparatide and the development of osteosarcoma has been observed.']",1,"The claim that teriparatide increases the risk of bone cancer is uncertain due to the lack of clear association observed in studies, leaving the potential risk and effect size unclear.","The suspicion that teriparatide could cause bone cancer as a side effect is based on animal studies on the one hand.

Can too much iodine cause autoimmune thyroid disease and consequently hypothyroidism?,"['Individual studies suggest that too large amounts of iodine may be responsible.', 'Probably a variety of causes These study results suggest that Hashimoto disease is more likely to occur in people with particularly high iodine consumption.', 'However, large amounts of iodine may cause serious disturbances in people with potentially undetected thyroid problems [8].', 'The studies in detail Whether large amounts of iodine can actually cause inflammation of the thyroid gland by an overreacting immune system is not well protected.', 'The result: the higher the iodine intake in a region, the greater the proportion of residents who suffer from autoimmune thyroid inflammation.']",0,"The claim that excessive iodine consumption can lead to autoimmune thyroid disease and hypothyroidism is supported by individual studies suggesting a link between high iodine intake and Hashimoto disease, as well as findings that regions with higher iodine consumption have a greater proportion of residents with autoimmune thyroid inflammation.",Autoimmune thyroid disease appears to occur more frequently in individuals with high iodine consumption. Whether high levels of iodine actually cause this disease has not been conclusively determined.
Does taking coconut oil improve mental abilities in dementia like Alzheimer's disease?,"['Although a recent summary of studies could not definitely confirm the relationship [4], it is recommended for patients at increased risk to consume less saturated fatty acids [5].', 'However, since the study has some methodological weaknesses, included only a few patients and is only a snapshot at a single point in time, it is not possible to draw reliable conclusions from this study [7].', ""Coconut oil poorly studied in Alzheimer's disease A company in the USA markets a component of coconut oil (caprylids) as a medical food for Alzheimer's disease."", ""Since the symptoms in Alzheimer's can improve for a short time, it is not possible to distinguish with the before-after examination whether the observed change is actually caused by the coconut oil or not by other factors.""]",1,"The claim that taking coconut oil improves mental abilities in dementia like Alzheimer's disease is uncertain due to methodological weaknesses in existing studies, limited patient samples, and the possibility of short-term symptom improvements being caused by other factors.",We could find only one clinical study on the use of coconut oil in Alzheimer's disease. This was of such poor quality that no firm statement is possible.
"Does the risk of food allergy decrease if babies are fed potentially allergenic foods (cow's milk, peanuts, chicken egg) as late as possible for the first time?","['The early feeding of baby-appropriately prepared peanuts seems to have reduced the risk of allergy.', 'If children in a study already received these foods at the age of three months, they did not have a higher risk of food allergy than children who were only fed at the age of six months [3].', ""If a woman tries to avoid theoretically allergic foods during pregnancy or breast-feeding, this does not seem to reduce her child's allergy risk [6]."", 'Whether the risk of allergies even decreases if babies are fed appropriate foods as early as possible is unclear for most foods.', ""According to another review, three further studies show that early contact with cow's milk is unlikely to make infants more susceptible to milk allergy [5].""]",2,The claim that delaying the introduction of potentially allergenic foods reduces the risk of food allergy is challenged by evidence suggesting that early feeding of these foods may actually reduce the risk of allergy or have no impact on it.,"in none of the clinical studies to date has the risk of food allergy decreased by feeding these foods as late as possible. Whether early supplementary feeding can reduce the risk is less clear, but possible at least for peanut allergy.

Can motherwort reduce migraine attacks?,"[""In the best case, mother's wort reduces the number of migraine attacks slightly more frequently than a dummy preparation (placebo) can do: On average, the study participants had about five migraine attacks a month, they regularly took mother's wort, it was only just under three."", 'However: Also a dummy preparation leads to an improvement, smotherwort only works a little better – it reduces 0.6 attacks more per month than the dummy medicine [1].', ""Mother's wort may reduce the number of attacks, but it has no effect on how severe the pain in the attacks is or how long they last.""]",0,"The claim that motherwort reduces migraine attacks is supported by the study's findings, which show that motherwort reduces the number of attacks, albeit only slightly more than a placebo, and has no effect on the severity or duration of the attacks.","The existing studies differ greatly in their methods and the results are sometimes contradictory. According to the study with the most participants, motherwort can slightly reduce the number of migraine attacks per month."

Can FGXpress Power Strips reduce pain or improve wound healing?,"['The pointless claim of detoxification and detoxification is also made.', 'Many of the promises require studies: whether and in which cases pain can be reduced and which wounds can be better cured would have to be proven by a manufacturer in studies.', 'To our knowledge, however, there is not a single study on FGXPress Power Strips.', 'Although the manufacturer shows before/after images with a thermal camera, without accurate documentation and control by outsiders, this is completely worthless.']",1,"The claim that FGXpress Power Strips can reduce pain or improve wound healing lacks concrete evidence, as there are no studies to support it, and the manufacturer's before/after images are unreliable without proper documentation and external verification.",We could not find a single study on these patches - nor any reason to assume that they are effective.
Are there effective alternatives to the breathing mask (CPAP) for sleep apnea?,"['The authors of an overview of 2013 see such interventions as a possible alternative for those patients who reject the breathing mask: During the day of fatigue they lead to a similar improvement as standard therapy, but they are not so good at reducing breath loss [2].', 'However, since the breath loss has a decisive influence on subsequent diseases, standard therapy is preferable if possible.', 'Overall, oxygen therapy is significantly less helpful than CPAP [3].', 'Conclusion For patients who reject standard therapy with breathing mask, there are numerous other treatment options available – but these are not as effective in the decisive symptoms as CPAP.']",2,"The claim that there are effective alternatives to the breathing mask for sleep apnea is challenged by the fact that while other interventions may improve daytime fatigue, they are less effective in reducing breath loss, a crucial factor in preventing subsequent diseases.","Although numerous other forms of treatment are available, some of them are too little researched or are clearly inferior to the standard therapy with CPAP."
Does taking magnesium salts decrease the frequency and intensity of muscle cramps with unknown cause?,"['Insufficient evidence The examination shows that the evidence of efficacy is rather meager: We have not found any high-quality studies that have investigated the effect of magnesium salts on exertive muscle spasms, for example in athletes.', 'It is therefore unclear whether athletes benefit from the intake of magnesium supplements.']",2,"The claim that taking magnesium salts decreases the frequency and intensity of muscle cramps with unknown cause is uncertain due to the lack of high-quality studies investigating the effect of magnesium salts on muscle spasms, leaving the efficacy of magnesium supplements unclear.","No high-quality studies have been found on the efficacy of magnesium salts for exercise-induced muscle cramps, such as in athletes. For leg muscle cramps without an identifiable cause, researchers have been unable to demonstrate any effect of magnesium beyond placebo in studies.

Does bisphenol A trigger allergies?,"['Hormone-like substances on the pill For BPA, the evidence of an allergy-promoting effect is currently not very strong.', 'The same study, which showed no correlation between the once measured BPA value in urine and existing allergies, found such association with the triclosan concentration in urine [2].']",1,"The claim that bisphenol A triggers allergies is uncertain due to the lack of strong evidence supporting an allergy-promoting effect, despite some studies finding correlations with other substances like triclosan.","Individual observational studies suggest an association between bisphenol A intake and the development of asthma, but not allergy, in early childhood. Asthma is often the consequence of allergy. However, the measurement of bisphenol A intake in these studies is too imprecise for a clear statement."
Does particulate matter pollution increase the risk of heart attack - even if the EU limits are complied with?,"['The study of over 367,000 adults from 13 European countries indicates that long-term exposure to particulate matter generally increases the risk of mortality – meaning life-saving [1].', ""The authors reported that long-term exposure to particulate matter at the place of residence makes the occurrence of heart attack and unstable angina pectoris ('heart', a sign of an imminent heart attack) more likely."", 'An English cohort study from 2013 could not deduce a link between heart attack risk and fine dust air pollution, but fine dust exposure increased the risks of other heart diseases.', 'The short-term inhalation of larger amounts of fine dust may also make a heart attack more likely.']",0,"The claim that particulate matter pollution increases the risk of heart attack even if EU limits are complied with is supported by the study's findings that long-term exposure to particulate matter increases the risk of mortality and heart attack, despite one English cohort study failing to establish a link between heart attack risk and fine dust air pollution.","Recent studies from Europe indicate that everyday exposure to particulate matter may increase the risk of acute heart disease (myocardial infarction, angina pectoris).

Are endocrine disruptors in cosmetics a health risk?,"['Thus, the risk for parabens is not demonstrated by clinical studies, especially not by cosmetics.', 'Many chemicals are not researched at all, the interaction with certain diseases is unknown and it is also not sufficiently clear when and how endocrine disruptors intervene in the physical development of adolescents [b].', 'Humans are therefore exposed to many such influences, which makes risk assessment very difficult.']",1,"The claim that endocrine disruptors in cosmetics are a health risk is uncertain due to the lack of clinical evidence for specific chemicals like parabens, unknown interactions with diseases, and the complexity of multiple influences on human health.","Although many cosmetics do indeed contain substances that can influence the hormone system, a health risk has not been proven. Ecological consequences, on the other hand, have already been demonstrated."
Does eye training help prevent myopia?,"['A systematic review did not find a controlled study in 2005 that could show an effect of eye training on shortsightedness – nor any that would suggest a preventive effect of eye training [1].', 'For other forms of falseness, there are also small and methodologically weak studies that find no difference between eye training and a control group [1].', 'But in most cases there is no evidence of the effect of visual training [1] [3].']",2,"The claim that eye training helps prevent myopia is refuted by the lack of evidence from systematic reviews and studies, which consistently show no effect or preventive effect of eye training on shortsightedness.","According to the current state of studies, an effectiveness of eye training can only be expected for very few diseases; an effect as prevention or therapy against myopia cannot be assumed at present."
