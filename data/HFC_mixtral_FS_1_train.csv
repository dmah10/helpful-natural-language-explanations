Can masks reduce corona infections when worn by a large proportion of the population?,"['Studies show slow spread After three years of pandemic, there are now relatively meaningful data that masks can slow down the spread of the Corona virus.', 'Surgical masks, in turn, seem to reduce the risk of infecting themselves with the corona virus.']",0,"The first sentence provides evidence that masks can slow down the spread of the Corona virus, supporting the claim that masks can reduce corona infections when worn by a large proportion of the population.","International studies suggest that the number of corona infections decreases when many people wear masks - whether fabric, surgical or FFP2 masks. However, it is not possible to precisely quantify how great the protective effect actually is. It probably depends on the type of masks and the proportion of people who wear them."
Can homeopathic preparations with Anamirta cocculus help against dizziness?,"['But without success: We could not find any meaningful scientific evidence for effectiveness in dizziness.', 'It is now well proven by studies that homeopathic preparations usually do not work better than a sham medication (placebo) [8].', 'However, it is not well established that betahistine is effective against dizziness [11.13].', 'The fact that betahist helps with dizziness is not well documented [11, 13].']",1,"The claim of homeopathic preparations with Anamirta cocculus helping against dizziness is not supported as there is no meaningful scientific evidence of their effectiveness, and they typically do not work better than a placebo.","We have found only one study that has investigated this. However, it is so poor that no reliable statement is possible."
Can zeolite alleviate or prevent health problems?,"['However, none of these can provide any evidence – because the studies have no significance (for reasons see section Studies in detail ).', 'It does not find an advantage for zeolite – but the results are hardly meaningful.', 'However, it is not researched whether the regular intake of zeolite can lead to a nutrient deficiency or has an undesirable effect on digestion.']",1,"The claim that zeolite can alleviate or prevent health problems is not supported by the provided sentences, as there is no significant evidence found in studies and no research on potential nutrient deficiencies or digestive effects due to regular zeolite intake.",Studies to date cannot provide any evidence that taking zeolite prevents or alleviates complaints. A detoxifying effect is not scientifically plausible.
Does paxlovid protect unvaccinated people with risk factors from severe or even fatal covid 19 disease?,"['Patients at risk without corona vaccination appear to be well protected from serious to fatal events by Paxlovid.', 'However, it is not certain how well Paxlovid helps people who have already received corona vaccination.', 'In addition, the scientists investigated whether Paxlovid alleviated the Covid-19 symptoms, shortened the duration of the disease and reduced the need for medical treatment: Half of the participants improved the symptoms with Paxlovid after 13 days, with placebo after 15 days.', 'With Paxlovid, 14 out of 1000 participants needed medical treatment for Covid-19 within a month, with placebo 76 out of 1000.', 'Whether with or without antibodies in the blood, Paxlovid basically protected all humans from a severe course.']",0,"While the sentences suggest that Paxlovid offers protection from severe or fatal Covid-19 for those with or without antibodies, they do not explicitly state whether this protection applies only to unvaccinated individuals with risk factors, leaving uncertainty regarding the claim.","In a large, well-done study, paxlovid prevented hospitalizations and deaths in high-risk patients. They were unvaccinated and had contracted the delta variant. For vaccinated people, the benefit cannot be reliably estimated. This also applies to people with immunodeficiency."
"Does starting school later improve health, learning success, and quality of life in adolescents?","['However, teenagers and parents now have to be very strong: despite 27 studies involving hundreds of thousands of students, no clear results can be derived from research.', 'The problem: The studies usually come to contradictory results.', 'So until better research results are available, all troubled young people and parents will only have the option of remaining out of bed early – or to hope that, despite lack of evidence, the school management will still have an insight into it.', 'It is difficult to examine whether a later start to school will have a positive effect.', 'The Problems: Unknown Influencing Factors: If differences occur in previous-after-studies, these do not have to be due to the later start of school – they may also have been caused by other changes over the course of the study period.']",1,The claim cannot be definitively supported or refuted due to contradictory results from existing studies and the presence of unknown influencing factors.,"The question has been investigated in several large studies. Due to methodological deficiencies and contradictory results, no firm conclusions can be drawn. This means that science can currently neither speak for nor against a benefit of a later school start."
Does the F.X. Mayr cure have health benefits? Can it prevent diseases or treat them?,"['Thus, the claim that the method can help with various diseases is not scientifically justified.', 'These studies cannot answer whether these changes also affect health.', 'Mayr cure or other fasting methods improve health in the long term, however, cannot be concluded.']",1,"The provided sentences offer no scientific evidence to support the claim that the F.X. Mayr cure has health benefits, prevents diseases, or treats them, and they suggest that the long-term health effects of fasting methods like the Mayr cure are inconclusive.","It is neither examined nor proven whether the special fasting method after F.X. Mayr holds, which it promises: Namely assistance with all possible illnesses of allergies, over rheumatism up to sleep disturbances. The advertised detoxification and ""purification"" of the body by the chamfering cure are besides scientifically not plausible."
Does the consumption of soy foods or soy isoflavones affect the appearance of acne skin?,"['In both cases, certain soya ingredients are responsible for the effect on the skin: the isoflavones.', 'There are two competing theories that contradict each other: according to the first theory, isoflavones confuse the hormone balance and are supposed to promote acne in this way.', 'Surprisingly, despite searching in two large databases, we could not find a study on soy products and acne – whether soy milk, soy sauce or tofu.', 'The isoflavones improved the skin appearance more than an anti-acne cream with vitamin A acid (Tretinoin).', 'Conclusion: There is currently no evidence from reliable studies that soy makes acne worse.']",1,"While there are theories suggesting isoflavones in soy products can disrupt hormone balance and potentially promote acne, a thorough search of two large databases revealed no studies directly examining the relationship between soy and acne, making it difficult to definitively support or refute the claim.","We could not find any meaningful studies at all on the influence of soy foods on acne. On soy isoflavones, we found two small studies of questionable quality that examined a very specific group of sufferers. Soy isoflavones improved the skin appearance somewhat. However, this result is not reliable."
Does extract from the Damiana plant (Turnera diffusa) help with erectile dysfunction?,"['Efficacy does not appear to have been studied or demonstrated.', 'The studies in detail We could not find any studies on Damiana extract against erectile dysfunction in men.', 'Studies on the product Neradin also appear to be missing.']",1,"The claim cannot be supported since there are no studies demonstrating the efficacy of Damiana extract for erectile dysfunction in men, and studies on the related product Neradin are also missing.","The extract from the Damiana plant (Turnera diffusa) is advertised as a remedy for erectile dysfunction for men. However, this claimed effect on potency is by no means proven. It has apparently never been tested on humans. This also applies to homeopathic remedies such as the product Neradin."
Does regular HPV testing in addition to the recommended Pap smear detect more precancerous lesions than just the Pap smear alone?,"['According to the studies, the HPV test is likely to detect slightly more precursors of cervical cancer over several years than the PAP swab alone.', 'We are therefore relatively sure that with an additional HPV test at least a little more precursors of uterine cancer are detected than only with the PAP swab alone.']",0,"The studies indicate that HPV testing detects marginally more precancerous cervical lesions over time compared to Pap smears alone, providing evidence for the claim.","Regular examination of the cervix by means of PAP smear tests detects precancerous stages of the cervix in most cases in good time. This reduces the risk of developing cervical cancer. An additional HPV test every three to five years can make screening even more reliable. However, the difference should not be too great."
Can monk's pepper reduce PMS symptoms? PMS is the abbreviation for premenstrual syndrome. This refers to complaints that occur in the days before menstruation.,"['Reference to efficacy in PMS According to previous studies, monk peppers could actually help in PMS.', 'The summarized study results indicate that the symptoms with monk pepper are reduced in more patients than with a sham medication (placebo).', 'Therefore, it would be possible for monk peppers to act against PMS symptoms such as breast spacing.']",0,"The summarized results of previous studies suggest that monk pepper may reduce PMS symptoms more effectively than a placebo, providing support for the claim.","In the studies to date, monk's pepper seems to relieve PMS symptoms better than a placebo. However, this is not well proven, because the studies have significant weaknesses. There is no evidence of an effect on menstrual disorders. Significant studies are lacking."
Can olive leaf extract reduce high blood pressure?,"['These studies therefore do not indicate whether olive leaf extract can help with significantly increased blood pressure.', 'Without success, however, we could not find any studies that investigated the effect of olive leaf extract on cardiovascular health.', 'However, they cannot provide clear answers.', 'It is therefore impossible to say whether olive leaves extract could have a better or worse effect with significantly increased blood pressure.']",1,"The studies referenced do not provide clear evidence indicating whether olive leaf extract can help reduce high blood pressure, as no studies investigating its effect on cardiovascular health were found to be successful.","Whether olive leaf extract lowers blood pressure has been investigated in five suitable studies to date. They all found no effect or only a slight effect of the extract. The problem with this is that most of the study participants had only slightly elevated blood pressure. They cannot answer how olive leaf extract works in people with significantly elevated blood pressure (hypertension). The studies also had gross flaws, few participants, and ran for a very short time. They cannot provide reliable answers."
Do green-lipped mussel preparations improve the symptoms of osteoarthritis?,"['Studies overall not meaningful The conclusion of our research: Scientific evidence for the claimed effect is missing.', 'It is also unclear whether the measured positive effects are large enough to actually be felt by those affected.', 'Whether or not green-lipped mussel helps with osteoarthritis cannot be said at the moment.', 'However, as early as 2009, the European Food Safety Authority considered that a protective effect of the green-lipped mussel on healthy joints has not been established.', 'In our opinion, no reliable conclusions can be drawn from the studies found.']",1,"The claim that green-lipped mussel preparations improve the symptoms of osteoarthritis is not supported by the research, which finds no scientific evidence for the claimed effect and considers the measured positive effects too small to be perceptible by those affected.","The question was examined in four small studies with serious methodological deficiencies, which also arrived at partly contradictory results. No clear conclusions can be drawn from them. The claim that green-lipped mussel helps with osteoarthritis is not scientifically proven."
Can probiotics lower blood sugar in type 2 diabetes?,"['And if so, can probiotics reverse this change and reduce blood sugar levels again?', 'At the most small effect, they may actually be able to.', 'However, the effect of the capsules and tablets does not seem to be large: in the previous studies, they were able to reduce the long-term sugar level HbA1c by an average of 0.55 points.']",0,"While some studies suggest probiotics may have a small effect in reducing HbA1c levels by an average of 0.55 points in type 2 diabetes, the impact of capsules and tablets does not seem to be large.","The summarized results of studies to date suggest that probiotics in capsule or tablet form could lower blood sugar somewhat. At least if they are taken over a period of two to three months. However, the effect is not well established. Probiotic dairy products and probiotic powder for dissolving do not seem to have any demonstrable effect."
Can CBD (cannabidiol) help with migraines or other headaches?,"['Apparently, CBD has never been investigated to see if it can help with migraine seizures.', 'The claim that CBD would help with migraines or headaches is pure speculation.', 'The studies in detail Despite extensive search in three databases, we could not find any studies on CBD against migraine or other types of headache, neither for treatment nor for prevention.']",1,"While there are no studies found on CBD's effectiveness against migraines or other headaches, the claim of its helpfulness remains speculative.",There are no studies that have investigated the effectiveness of CBD against migraine. So claims that CBD can help with or prevent migraine attacks have no scientific basis. The same is true for other types of headache.
Can laser irradiation of blood by infusion needle (hemolaser treatment) relieve discomfort or help with diseases?,"['It is also unclear by what mechanism blood irradiation with bundled red light – i.e.', 'red laser – should improve health.', 'Although the authors of the three studies found [1-3] claim to have established a clear efficacy of haemolaser treatment, none of the three studies is suitable to prove this.']",1,"The three studies on hemolaser treatment lack the necessary rigor to establish its claimed efficacy in improving health, and the mechanism by which red laser irradiation of blood improves health remains unclear.",There is no scientific evidence that hemolaser treatment has a palliative or curative effect on health problems.
"In everyday life, when breathing with an FFP2 mask or ordinary mouth-nose protection, do you get as much oxygen as without a mask?","['As much oxygen as without a mask This fear is, however, unfounded, as previously conducted studies show [ 1,2 ].', 'Only in very strenuous sports (fast cycling to exhaustion) was the oxygen content in the blood with FFP2 mask slightly lower than without mask.', 'There was no difference in oxygen measurement with ordinary oral nose protection.', 'Breathing a little more strenuous The results thus contradict the rumor that masks would cause an oxygen deficiency.']",0,"The claim is supported by the sentences provided, as previous studies indicate no significant difference in oxygen intake when wearing an FFP2 mask or ordinary mouth-nose protection in everyday life, except for very strenuous sports with the FFP2 mask.","Even if breathing with a mask can feel uncomfortable: According to studies to date, you get just as much oxygen with an FFP2 mask or mouth-nose protection as without a mask. This is true even when you are moving or exerting yourself. Only very intensive sports slightly reduce the oxygen content in the blood - but too little to endanger health."
Can CBD help with period pain?,"['Because despite searching in three different databases we could not find a single study on CBD in case of regular pain.', 'Scientifically, it is not sufficiently researched whether CBD actually promotes sleep, as providers claim.', 'The studies in detail We could not find any studies that investigated whether CBD can help with normal pain – neither for treatment nor for prevention.']",1,"The sentences provide no evidence specifically regarding CBD's effect on period pain, as no studies were found to support this claim.",Whether CBD can relieve menstrual pain has apparently never been scientifically studied. We could not find any studies on this. Women who suffer from severe period pain should talk to a gynecologist about it. Diseases such as endometriosis could be behind it.
"Can a bioresonance device like ""Bioscan"" or ""Vieva Vital Analyser"" measure mineral and vitamin deficiencies or detect health problems?","['This experiment clearly shows that the devices studied are completely unsuitable to diagnose a lack of vitamins or minerals.', 'Sentenced for fraud at the end of May 2022, a German court also concluded that the Bioscan device cannot fulfil the claimed claims.', 'Claims for comparable products are equally implausible.', 'Even if 1000 subjects had participated in the study and only five to six people had shown such unreliable readings, such a device would be worthless for diagnostics.']",2,"The sentences provide evidence that Bioscan and similar devices cannot accurately measure mineral and vitamin deficiencies or detect health problems, as concluded by a German court and demonstrated in an experiment.","An experiment shows that the devices cannot distinguish between healthy people, seriously ill people and a corpse. The claimed mode of action behind the measurement method is also scientifically implausible. A German court has convicted the manufacturers of the Bioscan device (not legally binding) of fraud."
Will women who have recurrent bladder infections get rid of them faster if they take cranberry products only after the disease is already there???,"['There is also only evidence that cranberry products can prevent bladder inflammation for otherwise healthy women.', 'However, there does not seem to be any meaningful studies that have investigated this in women with recurrent bladder inflammation.', 'The preventive effect of cranberry in children, men and people with urinary catheters or certain diseases has not been studied.']",1,"The claim cannot be supported or refuted because there is no meaningful study that has investigated the effect of cranberry products on women with recurrent bladder infections, as stated in the sentences.","Women who repeatedly have to deal with bladder infections might become ill somewhat less frequently if they regularly take cranberry juice or extract. However, this is not well established. And it only applies to uncomplicated bladder infections in otherwise healthy women. Whether cranberry products help when cystitis is already present remains unclear. This has not yet been investigated in meaningful studies."
Can extract from St. John's wort relieve the symptoms of depression? Is it similarly effective as drugs against depression (antidepressants)?,"[""St John's wort: effective in mild to moderate depression Probably yes."", ""In mild to moderate depression, St John's wort preparations probably work better than placebo."", ""St John's wort preparations are probably as good as antidepressants."", ""St. John's wort and antidepressants can relieve the discomfort, but the depression can probably not cure for good.""]",0,"The claim is supported by the sentences stating that St. John's wort is likely effective in mild to moderate depression, works better than a placebo, and is as good as antidepressants, although it may not cure depression permanently.",St. John's wort is likely to relieve the symptoms of mild to moderate depression better than a placebo. It also appears to be similarly effective to approved medications for depression (antidepressants). St. John's wort preparations are generally better tolerated than antidepressants.
"Does the Zisano bracelet strengthen the immune system, increase endurance and performance or reduce fatigue?","['Whether such bracelets have an effect, for example whether they can actually increase physical performance or strengthen the immune system, has apparently never been investigated.', 'Bracelets for more performance: studies show ineffectiveness All five studies came to the same conclusion: the bracelets had no effect on the performance or well-being of the subjects.', 'A scientifically plausible explanation as to how exactly such bracelets should develop their effect remains to be found in their suppliers.', 'The studies in detail We could not find any studies on the Zisano bracelet or comparable bracelets with silicon chip.']",1,"The claim that the Zisano bracelet strengthens the immune system, increases endurance and performance, or reduces fatigue is not supported by the provided sentences, as there is no scientific evidence found regarding the effectiveness of the Zisano bracelet or similar bracelets with a silicon chip.","The promised positive effects of the ""Powerband"" wristband on health and well-being have apparently not been scientifically studied. We could not find any studies on this. It is also unclear how the wristband is supposed to work in concrete terms. A scientifically plausible explanation is missing."
"Does microimmunotherapy improve symptoms of allergies, cancer, joint inflammation, autoimmune diseases, dementia or various viral infections?","['None of these studies are meaningful – because they are poorly carried out and the published data are incomplete.', 'They cannot give any indication of the benefits of microimmune therapy.', 'Entitled doubts Since microimmune therapy preparations are highly diluted as homeopathic agents, we have fundamental doubts about the method.']",1,"The claim cannot be supported as the provided sentences express doubts about the method of microimmunotherapy due to its high dilution, similar to homeopathic agents, and question the validity of studies due to incomplete data and poor execution.","So far, studies seem to exist only on microimmunotherapy against hay fever and cancer. Their significance is far too low to conclude that the therapy is effective. We found no studies on other health problems. Thus, there is no proven benefit of microimmunotherapy for any disease."
Can ginkgo extract improve mental performance in dementia patients?,"['Dementia patients taking Ginkgo extract often seemed to perform better in thinking, memory, and concentration tasks than those who swallowed placebo preparations without an active substance [1.3].', 'Although the studies indicate that Ginkgo extract can help people with dementia, the significance of the individual studies is limited.']",0,"While some studies suggest Ginkgo extract may help dementia patients with thinking, memory, and concentration tasks, the significance of individual studies is limited.",Previous studies suggest that ginkgo extract can improve mental performance in dementia - but this is not well established. It is not possible to say exactly how large this effect is.
Does pine wood improve sleep?,"['So there is no indication that the pine wood improves sleep.', 'The importance of these laboratory measurements for the sleep of the participants is unclear – even if the researchers interpret them as positive effects of the circling bed.', 'Whether a pine bed actually improves sleep would have to study more rigorous studies carried out according to scientific criteria on significantly more subjects in the future.The studies in detail [1,2] Grote et al.']",1,"While some studies suggest positive effects of pine wood on sleep quality, the first sentence directly refutes the claim that pine wood improves sleep, stating there is no indication of such an effect.","So far, only one small study has investigated this question. However, the results of this study are not conclusive due to numerous deficiencies in the conduct of the study."
Do spermidine supplements or a spermidine-rich diet reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia? Do they help with existing dementia?,"['Spermidin studies: not enough as evidence of efficacy Even if both studies had come to overwhelmingly positive results, we would still have concerns about their significance.', 'Spermidine, which is additionally absorbed by food, is not sufficiently researched at the present time.', 'The number of participants is low and the risk is high that the results are not transferable to reality.', 'We do not consider the study to be meaningful.', 'Results: Both the spermidine group and the comparator group had fewer dementia symptoms and better mental performance at the end of the study.']",1,"The claim cannot be supported by the provided sentences, as the studies on spermidine's effects on dementia symptoms have low participant numbers and their results may not be representative of real-world scenarios, while spermidine's role in dementia risk reduction remains insufficiently researched.","Manufacturers of spermidine drugs advertise an alleged positive effect on mental performance and protection against dementia. However, such an effect has not been proven in meaningful studies. We found a single study in which dementia patients had participated. However, their results are not very clear."
Do green-lipped mussel preparations improve the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis?,"['For us, therefore, this claim is not credible.', 'Whether green-lipped mussel helps with rheumatism or not, can therefore not be said for sure at the moment.', 'Whether the results can be transferred to other products or other dosages is unclear.', ""The studies are all badly done according to today's standard: so it is unclear how reliable the measurements of the treatment success are."", 'Whether rheumatism patients would still benefit from green-lipped mussel preparations remains unclear.']",1,"While some studies exist, their quality is questionable, making it unclear if green-lipped mussel preparations alleviate rheumatoid arthritis symptoms or if results can be applied to different products or dosages.","Five small studies provide no overall evidence of benefit from green-lipped mussel in rheumatism. However, the rheumatism treatment of the participants does not meet today's standards and the studies were very poorly conducted. Therefore, we cannot draw any reliable conclusions from these studies."
Does the pill affect the muscle strength of women??,"['Does the pill also affect muscle strength?', 'The available studies do not provide any indication of such an effect.']",2,The available studies do not suggest that the pill has any effect on women's muscle strength.,"Taking the pill could possibly impair endurance performance in sports somewhat. However, there are no indications of less muscle strength due to the pill. However, these - somewhat contradictory - findings are anything but certain. Whether the somewhat reduced endurance performance speaks against contraception with the pill, each athlete must decide for herself - depending on how important top athletic performance is for her."
Does transcranial pulse stimulation (TPS) improve mental performance in people with Alzheimer's dementia? Can the treatment improve the quality of life of those affected?,"['Therefore, we do not consider the study results to be meaningful.', ""Transcranial pulse stimulation: not recognized as Alzheimer's therapy Even if providers of transcranial pulse stimulation claim otherwise: as therapy, the treatment with ultrasound in dementia is neither researched nor recognized."", 'There are currently no studies that can prove that it can help people with dementia in the short term or in the long term.', 'None of the studies can answer whether transcranial pulse stimulation or similar procedures help people with dementia.']",1,"The claim is not supported as there are no studies proving the short-term or long-term benefits of transcranial pulse stimulation for people with dementia, and it is not recognized as a therapy for Alzheimer's dementia.",Whether transcranial pulse stimulation can help people with Alzheimer's dementia has not yet been investigated in meaningful studies. Possible harmful effects have also been insufficiently researched.
Can low-level laser therapy reduce wrist osteoarthritis pain?,"['There is a well-made study on wrist arthritis: it showed no difference in efficacy between low-level laser therapy and placebo treatment.', 'This was not the case, the laser treatment could not relieve the pain better than placebo treatment.']",2,"The study found no difference in pain relief between low-level laser therapy and placebo treatment for wrist osteoarthritis, contradicting the claim.","In the pain treatment of wrist osteoarthritis, no efficacy can be assumed - this is indicated by the results of a small but well-done study. Research results on knee osteoarthritis are contradictory and therefore of little significance. We did not find any reliable studies on hip osteoarthritis."
Does blood type affect the likelihood that Covid 19 disease will take a severe course or lead to death?,"['Here, the results found seem to contradict the influence of the blood group on the probability of death: the researchers found no connection between certain blood groups and the severity of the disease.', 'Overall, the available data are not meaningful enough to establish or exclude a relationship between the blood group and the course of covid-19 disease.', 'It is certain that no one is protected from a serious Covid-19 history because of their type of blood.', 'No evidence of severe progression in certain blood groups The researchers found no evidence that in the case of a Covid-19 disease, people with a particular blood group need to be treated more frequently in hospital or intensive care units.']",1,"The sentences provide no evidence supporting a relationship between blood type and the severity or likelihood of death from Covid-19, and one statement directly refutes this claim, stating that no one is protected from a serious Covid-19 history because of their blood type.",There is no reliable evidence that people with a certain blood group are more severely affected by covid-19 than those with another. Study results on this are poorly substantiated and partly contradictory.
Does CBD (cannabidiol) relieve symptoms of mild to moderate covid-19 disease?,"[""We can't say with absolute certainty that CBD is ineffective at Covid-19, but we think it is reasonably probable."", 'In addition, there is evidence from other studies that CBD may even increase the susceptibility to infection [4].', 'Although she appears in some media reports, the report is simply wrong that the researchers had demonstrated an anti-corona effect of CBD in their study: According to the research team, CBD had no effect on the corona virus in the experiments.', 'No benefit from CBD After 28 days, the study team took stock: Overall, the participants of the CBD group felt no better than those of the placebo group.']",2,"While some media reports may claim an anti-corona effect of CBD, the research team involved has stated that CBD had no effect on the coronavirus in their experiments, and a study found no difference in symptom relief between the CBD and placebo groups after 28 days.","CBD is unlikely to have any effect on the symptoms of covid-19 disease. This is the conclusion of the only study that has investigated this. However, its validity is somewhat limited due to the small number of participants. Not explored is a possible preventive effect. It is unclear whether CBD or other cannabis constituents - ingested or smoked - protect against corona infection or covid-19 disease."
Do sedatives and sleeping pills such as benzodiazepines and related substances increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease or other forms of dementia?,"['However, it cannot be clearly dispelled by the fact that benzodiazepines and similar substances could promote the development of dementia.']",1,"The sentence suggests a correlation between benzodiazepines and dementia, but it does not provide sufficient evidence to confirm a causative relationship between the two.","A link between the long-term use of sedatives and sleeping pills and the development of dementia cannot be ruled out. However, whether the drugs are the cause of dementia is unclear. Likewise, it is possible that studies show a connection only because people in the undiagnosed early stages of dementia suffer more frequently from sleep disorders or restlessness and therefore take medication against them more often."
"Does taking polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as omega-3 and omega-6, reduce ADHD symptoms in children?","['Overall, the preparations do not seem to make children with ADHD quieter and more concentrated.', 'Whether omega fatty acid preparations or placebo, all children showed similarly strong ADHD symptoms.', 'On closer examination, it appears that the best-performed, blinded studies show no or even a negative effect of the omega fatty acid preparations on the behaviour of the participating children.']",2,"The claim is refuted by the sentences, as the best-performed studies indicate no or even a negative effect of omega fatty acid preparations on ADHD symptoms in children, and both omega fatty acid preparations and placebo showed similarly strong ADHD symptoms in all children.","Studies to date suggest that supplements containing polyunsaturated fatty acids (for example, omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids) tend not to have a noticeable effect on attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, the quality of the studies is not sufficient to provide definitive answers."
Do infusions of vitamin C relieve symptoms of chronic fatigue or long covid?,"['It is also unclear whether people with Long Covid benefit from vitamin C infusions.', 'One of the two authors is also an employee of a pharmaceutical company that also offers products with vitamin C.  Since the developmental mechanisms of both chronic fatigue syndrome and long covid are unclear, studies with cancer patients or healthy participants cannot provide answers to the question whether vitamin C can help people with chronic fatigue syndrome or long covid.']",1,"While some studies suggest that vitamin C can have health benefits, there is no clear evidence or understanding of the developmental mechanisms of chronic fatigue syndrome and long covid to conclude that vitamin C infusions can relieve symptoms of these conditions, especially considering potential biases from pharmaceutical company ties.",Whether vitamin C infusions help with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is questionable. This has not yet been scientifically investigated. We also could not find a single study on vitamin C and fatigue occurring in the context of Long Covid.
Does taking probiotics shorten the duration of acute infectious diarrhea?,"['Thus, at least in children, taking live probiotics is unlikely to affect whether they are still ill after 48 hours.', 'Thus, a probiotic apparently has no clear influence on the resolution of the disease.']",2,"The sentences indicate that probiotics do not have a clear influence on resolving acute infectious diarrhea, which contradicts the claim that probiotics can shorten its duration.","According to current studies, the duration of disease cannot be reduced by taking probiotics. This assessment is reasonably well supported."
Does high-dose vitamin D slow down the course of disease in multiple sclerosis (MS)?,"['However, such observations alone are not sufficient to actually demonstrate the benefit of highly dosed vitamin D in MS.   Studies on vitamin D in MS We have therefore been looking for meaningful studies on the high-dose treatment of vitamin D in multiple sclerosis.', 'At present, we cannot say for sure whether highly dosed vitamin D actually brings benefits to MS.', 'However, the data so far suggest that an effect, if any, would be rather small.']",1,"The data so far suggests that any potential effect of high-dose vitamin D on MS would be small, and there is no definitive evidence of significant benefits.","We can neither clearly exclude nor confirm that there is an effect. In a total of 15 studies, no benefit could be demonstrated for high-dose vitamin D in adults with multiple sclerosis. Because the studies had many weaknesses, we cannot draw any conclusions about positive or negative effects."
"Can ozone therapy, in which autologous blood is treated with ozone and recycled, favorably influence the course of COVID-19 disease?","['There are no differences between standard treatment and additional ozone therapy – neither in the progression of Covid-19 disease nor in the risk of death.', 'An advantage for ozone therapy did not arise, for none of the comparisons there was a clear difference: neither for the risk of death to Covid-19 nor for the course of the disease [5].', 'Thus, the sole effect of autologous ozone therapy has not been established here either.']",1,"The sentences provide evidence that there is no clear advantage for ozone therapy in reducing the risk of death or altering the course of COVID-19 disease, consistent with the claim.",The few studies on this subject have gross deficiencies and are therefore not conclusive. Their results do not provide any evidence of efficacy of ozone therapy.
Does dimenhydrinate relieve travel nausea better than a placebo?,"['However, we are very sceptical here: we consider the results to be so little meaningful that we can neither see any evidence of effectiveness nor exclude it.', 'In general, it remains questionable how reliable the results can be transferred to other situations where travel sickness occurs.', 'However, we do not consider this assessment to be meaningful: the number of test subjects was far too small, and, therefore, the fluctuation range was far too large.']",1,"The small number of test subjects and large fluctuation range make it difficult to rely on or refute the claim that dimenhydrinate relieves travel nausea better than a placebo, and the applicability of the results to other travel sickness situations is questionable.","The best available studies on the subject are unfortunately not conclusive, for example because they were quite small and the publications lack many details for traceability.  Therefore, we can neither prove nor exclude an effect."
Does dimenhydrinate relieve travel nausea as well as the proven drug scopolamine???,"['According to study authors, dimenhydrinate is supposed to help better than a placebo but has a worse effect than the proven drug Scopolamine.']",1,"The claim that dimenhydrinate relieves travel nausea as well as the proven drug scopolamine is not supported by the statement that while it performs better than a placebo, it has a worse effect than scopolamine.","The best available studies on the subject are unfortunately not conclusive, for example because they were quite small and the publications lack many details for traceability.  Therefore, we can neither prove nor exclude an effect."
Does short-term fasting reduce the side effects of chemotherapy for cancer???,"['On this basis, we cannot reliably say whether fasting during chemotherapy is actually useful or not, thus reducing side effects and improving the quality of life.', 'Whether fasting prevents or mitigates the side effects of chemotherapy is also not clear from the results: In one of the studies [1a] there was no difference in side effects such as fatigue or nerve pain: they were similarly common and similarly severe in both groups.', 'All of this means that the results of the studies are extremely uncertain and we cannot see or exclude the effectiveness of fasting.']",1,"The claim that short-term fasting reduces the side effects of chemotherapy for cancer is not supported by the provided sentences, which state that the results of studies on this topic are uncertain and do not clearly show a reduction in side effects.",We found only three very small studies on both questions. Their results are so unreliable that we cannot make any assessment. So we cannot say whether the quality of life of those affected is improved and whether fasting during chemotherapy reduces side effects.
Are extracts of Artemisa annua (annual mugwort) or the active ingredient artemisinin obtained from it effective against coronavirus?,"['We have not found any studies to prevent Corona infection.', 'However, it has several inconsistencies, so it cannot answer whether Artemisia helps the sick.', 'However, the limited anti-malaria effect of artemisinin does not indicate efficacy against other diseases.', 'For several reasons, we do not consider these results to be reliable: The standard treatment differed greatly: some of the participants received, for example, cortisone-containing drugs that are known to be effective, while others did not.']",1,"The claim cannot be supported or refuted as there are no studies indicating Artemisia annua or artemisinin preventing or treating coronavirus, and the limited anti-malaria effect of artemisinin does not suggest efficacy against other diseases, while the provided sentences raise concerns about the reliability of existing studies.","To date, only one study can be found that investigated Artemisia treatment in mild covid-19 progression. However, due to numerous shortcomings, the results are not conclusive.

Can zinc mitigate the progression of Covid-19?,"['Thus zinc should not cause Covid-19 sufferers to get better more quickly [3].', 'However, compared to the other half that did not take zinc, they did not recover faster.', 'So these results suggest that zinc treatment at Covid-19 is not helpful.']",2,"The sentences indicate that zinc treatment does not result in faster recovery for Covid-19 patients compared to those not taking zinc, which contradicts the claim that zinc can mitigate the progression of Covid-19.",The results of two studies on this suggest that sufferers with Covid-19 do not recover more quickly with zinc than without. A preventive effect has not yet been investigated in studies.
Does a cold spray with trypsin protect against colds or covid-19? Does the spray reduce symptoms and duration of illness?,"['No previously published study has investigated whether the cold spray can prevent a disease.', 'Thus, it is not certain that the cold spray shortens the duration of a cold.', 'If you look at the number of people who report cold complaints after artificial infection (21 out of 23 in the spray group, 16 out of 23 in the placebo group), there is no clear difference that speaks for a preventive effect of the cold spray.', 'Therefore, we do not consider the results of the study meaningful: With spray, the participants assessed the duration of their cold shorter (7.7 days) than without spray (10.4 days).', 'Interestingly, there was no clear difference between the two groups: The spray group did not reach much less to other colds than the control group.']",1,"The study's results do not support the claim that a cold spray with trypsin reduces the duration or symptoms of colds or COVID-19, as there is no significant difference in cold duration or occurrence between the spray and placebo groups.",The question was investigated in two small studies with gross deficiencies. They cannot prove that treatment with the cold spray relieves symptoms or shortens the duration of illness. Whether the spray has a preventive effect has not been researched for either colds or Covid-19.

Therefore, it can currently neither be confirmed nor ruled out that the risk of lung cancer may increase with ACE inhibitors. Even if further studies should really confirm the increased risk, the effect is likely to be rather small."

Can glutamate in food cause intolerance symptoms?,"['There are many case reports of an alleged glutamate hypersensitivity, but these can hardly be verified.', 'But among the alleged glutamate-sensitive subjects there was no one who showed symptoms after all glutamate [3].', 'The available studies show that up to three grams of glutamate does not cause symptoms in a selected group of healthy individuals.']",1,"While there are anecdotal reports of glutamate hypersensitivity, no individual in a selected group showed symptoms after consuming glutamate, and up to three grams of glutamate did not cause symptoms in healthy individuals, making it unclear if glutamate in food can cause intolerance symptoms.","There is no conclusive evidence that the consumption of glutamate triggers complaints. However, since studies conducted to date have shown deficiencies, it cannot be ruled out that there are isolated individuals who react sensitively to large amounts of glutamate."
Does the Orthopulse device accelerate the orthodontic correction of malocclusions?,"['Little meaningful The three published studies [1-3] cannot convince: None of the studies actually investigates the entire duration of treatment, but only the speed of tooth movements in the correction phase of brace therapy.', 'This does not make any sure statements about the reduction of the overall duration of treatment with which the manufacturer advertises.', 'Theoretically, two effects of orthopulses would be conceivable: positive effects if the duration of treatment were shortened, or negative effects if conversion processes at the tooth root were accelerated.', 'Thus, it is also questionable whether the faster treatment with the orthopulse device actually results from infrared therapy: In the control group, the teeth move on average by 0.44 mm per week, in the group with the orthopulse device on average by 1.27 mm per week.']",1,"The studies on the Orthopulse device only investigate the speed of tooth movements during brace therapy, not the entire duration of treatment, providing insufficient evidence to confirm the manufacturer's claim of reduced overall treatment time.",Poorly done studies show that the device can accelerate tooth movement in the short term. Whether this reduces the overall treatment time has not yet been sufficiently proven. The methodological weaknesses of the studies also mean that the results are not very credible. Possible side effects have not yet been sufficiently investigated.
Are vegetables prepared in a microwave oven less healthy than those prepared in other ways?,"['Recent studies see the matter more differentiated: Depending on the variety of vegetables and the exact type of preparation, the microwave can sometimes be better and sometimes worse suited than, for example, cooking [2-12].', 'In the worst case, if it is exaggerated with the duration and the number of watts, the corresponding food is less health-promoting, but in no way harmful to health.', 'If there are health problems related to the microwave, then this is not because the microwave ingredients are destroyed or changed, but because it is simply too unhealthy to eat altogether.', 'The week-long feeding with always several times warmed up in the microwave has not led to any signs of poisoning in the animals.']",2,"While some studies suggest that microwave preparation of vegetables can be better or worse than other methods depending on the type and duration, there is no evidence indicating that microwaved vegetables become harmful to health or that health issues related to microwaves stem from ingredient destruction.","How vegetables change during preparation is extremely variable. With any type of heating, ingredients can be lost or become more easily accessible. In sum, it cannot be said that preparation in the microwave is always a bad choice."
Can garlic extract reduce high blood pressure and thus the risk of cardiovascular disease?,"['Two better performed randomised-controlled studies provide cautious evidence that garlic can lower too high blood pressure [1].', 'However, even the results of these two studies are insufficiently valid for a clear assessment [1].', 'Whether garlic taken regularly can lower too high blood pressure and thus lower the risk of cardiovascular disease remains unclear for the time being.', 'At least in theory, there may also be interactions with anticoagulant drugs or side effects in persons with a tendency to bleed, as garlic is suspected to have an anticoagulant effect.']",1,"While two studies suggest garlic can lower high blood pressure, their validity is questioned, leaving it unclear if garlic can reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and potential interactions with anticoagulant drugs or side effects in individuals prone to bleeding.","Studies to date provide tentative evidence of a blood pressure-lowering effect of garlic. However, they are of too low quality to be able to prove a reduction in the risk of cardiovascular disease as a result of high blood pressure."

However, for both migraine and tension headaches, acupuncture performs only slightly better than sham acupuncture. Whether the pricking of traditional acupuncture points plays a role is unclear."
Can green tea reduce the likelihood of dying from cancer ?,"['In some studies, there was indeed a slightly reduced probability of disease, but other studies even suggested an increased risk of cancer from the use of green tea.', 'The result provides sobering clarity: people who regularly drink large amounts of green tea die in sum as often at some kind of cancer as people who hardly touch green tea [8].', 'To a degree harmless Although the benefits of green tea against cancer are questionable, there is no evidence of a health-impairing effect in moderate consumption of some cups a day [2].']",2,"While some studies suggest a slight reduction in disease probability with green tea consumption, others indicate an increased cancer risk, and overall, regular drinkers of large amounts of green tea die from cancer at similar rates as those who rarely drink it, providing no clear evidence of reduced likelihood of dying from cancer due to green tea consumption.",The results of previous studies suggest that green tea cannot reduce the risk of dying from cancer.
Can plant sterols or foods with them reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease?,"['However, it is unclear whether the intake of such high amounts of plant sterols – e.g.', 'Whether these results are a coincidence or whether the higher rate of cardiovascular problems are actually due to plant sterols and not to other causes is unclear.', 'Cholesterol is also different Whether plant sterols can actually reduce not only LDL cholesterol levels, but also the risk of cardiovascular diseases, has not been investigated in a single clinical study.']",1,"While studies show that plant sterols can lower LDL cholesterol levels, there is no clinical study demonstrating that they reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases specifically.","Plant sterols do lower cholesterol levels. However, whether they also reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease has not been researched. Animal studies even provide evidence that plant sterols in large quantities could increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. Whether this also applies to humans has not been investigated."
Can too much iodine cause autoimmune thyroid disease and consequently hypothyroidism?,"['Individual studies suggest that too large amounts of iodine may be responsible.', 'Probably a variety of causes These study results suggest that Hashimoto disease is more likely to occur in people with particularly high iodine consumption.', 'However, large amounts of iodine may cause serious disturbances in people with potentially undetected thyroid problems [8].', 'The studies in detail Whether large amounts of iodine can actually cause inflammation of the thyroid gland by an overreacting immune system is not well protected.', 'The result: the higher the iodine intake in a region, the greater the proportion of residents who suffer from autoimmune thyroid inflammation.']",0,"The claim is partially supported by individual studies suggesting a link between high iodine consumption and Hashimoto's disease, but the evidence is not conclusive on iodine directly causing inflammation of the thyroid gland or hypothyroidism.",Autoimmune thyroid disease appears to occur more frequently in individuals with high iodine consumption. Whether high levels of iodine actually cause this disease has not been conclusively determined.
Is the sweetener aspartame harmful to health?,"['The result: the sweetener is in all probability safe.', 'Safety levels Based on the results of numerous studies in laboratory animals and humans, the scientists established a safety limit for aspartame.', 'Thus, every person can take 40 milligrams per kilogram of body weight every day for the rest of his life without fear of health consequences.', 'Even those who exceed this amount will not suffer any health hazard.']",2,"Based on numerous studies in laboratory animals and humans, scientists have established a safety limit for aspartame, indicating that it is unlikely to be harmful to health when consumed within the recommended daily limit.","Health damage from aspartame is unlikely. This also applies to people who consume aspartame-sweetened foods and beverages in large quantities over a long period of time. However, in people suffering from the hereditary disease phenylketonuria (PKU), aspartame can cause nerve and brain damage."
Does coffee affect cancer death risk?,"['Both studies concluded that coffee consumption has no effect on cancer mortality.', 'In other words, coffee generally does not seem to favor or prevent death through cancer.', 'For breast cancer, prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer and bladder cancer there seems to be no association with the consumption of coffee.', 'Conclusion: Coffee consumption does not seem to affect cancer mortality.', 'They did not detect any influence of coffee on the number of cancer deaths.']",2,"The studies consistently show no association between coffee consumption and a reduced or increased risk of cancer mortality, including specific types such as breast, prostate, pancreatic, and bladder cancer.",Current evidence suggests that coffee consumption in general is neither protective nor detrimental to cancer death risk.
Do diets with primarily or exclusively uncooked foods have health benefits?,"['Whether raw food followers suffer a heart attack or stroke less often, need less medication or live longer overall, can not be derived from this.', 'Conclusion A health benefit of raw food, which goes beyond an increased consumption of vegetable foods, has not been conclusively proven.', 'Rather, there are indications that strict raw food diets may also have a negative impact on health – similar to other diets that severely restrict food selection.']",1,"The claim that diets with primarily or exclusively uncooked foods have health benefits beyond an increased consumption of vegetable foods has not been conclusively proven, and there are indications of potential negative impacts similar to other restrictive diets.","In studies, we have not been able to find convincing evidence that raw foods provide health benefits over healthy diets that include cooked foods. On the contrary, there is also evidence of possible harm."
Can increased water consumption prevent migraines or other headaches?,"['Preventive effect of water unclear In 2011, Dutch researchers published a study [1] according to which drinking an additional one and a half liters of water per day could significantly relieve headaches.', 'Until strict clinical studies with a larger number of patients have been conducted, the effectiveness of increased water consumption cannot really be assessed.', 'However, if increased drinking can actually prevent headaches, the effect may not be particularly large.']",1,"While a study suggests that additional water consumption may alleviate headaches, the overall preventive effect remains unclear due to the lack of large-scale clinical studies.","Whether drinking more water can prevent headaches cannot be answered satisfactorily on the basis of studies conducted to date.

Are there health benefits to screening the general population for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as a precaution?,"['Recommendation against COPD screening The answer may surprise: such a precautionary examination does not bring any discernible health benefit.', ""If you don't have any symptoms yet and only learns about a COPD due to the screening, you may not have any benefit at all [1,2]."", 'Here, too, a population-wide COPD early detection does not bring any health benefit.']",2,"The sentences provide evidence that screening the general population for COPD does not offer discernible health benefits, aligning with the claim and suggesting a refutation.",Even people with moderately severe COPD may have little health benefit from starting treatment as early as possible. People without symptoms who are diagnosed with COPD only as a result of a screening test are therefore unlikely to gain much health benefit from drug treatment.
Can cow's milk cause iron deficiency in babies in the first year of life?,"[""Moreover, the infant can use iron from cow's milk much worse, because among other things the calcium and casein contained in it inhibits the absorption of iron."", ""Babies actually seem to suffer more from iron deficiency when they are fed cow's milk early on."", ""Only as far as iron deficiency is concerned, statements are possible: Seven out of eight studies suggest that early use of cow's milk in babies significantly increases the risk of iron deficiency.""]",0,"The sentences suggest that cow's milk may hinder iron absorption in babies and increase the risk of iron deficiency, implying a potential negative impact on iron levels.","Cow's milk is low in usable iron.

Does the herbal hormone genistein reduce the number and intensity of hot flashes during menopause???,"['However: Genistein – which is a phytoestrogen from the group of isoflavones – may have a beneficial effect on the frequency of hot flashes at higher doses.', 'There was indeed a certain positive effect here: the frequency of hot flashes was reduced.']",0,"The first sentence suggests that genistein may have a beneficial effect on the frequency of hot flashes at higher doses, which supports the claim of a reduction in hot flashes, while the second sentence confirms a reduction in the frequency of hot flashes.","It is unclear whether phytoestrogens can help with hot flashes. Studies on this topic are often of modest quality; usually a comparison of the data is not possible. Therefore, an overall judgment cannot be made. One exception is the phytoestrogen genistein. There are indications that this plant substance in higher doses may be able to reduce the number of daily hot flashes a little."
Can FGXpress Power Strips reduce pain or improve wound healing?,"['The pointless claim of detoxification and detoxification is also made.', 'Many of the promises require studies: whether and in which cases pain can be reduced and which wounds can be better cured would have to be proven by a manufacturer in studies.', 'To our knowledge, however, there is not a single study on FGXPress Power Strips.', 'Although the manufacturer shows before/after images with a thermal camera, without accurate documentation and control by outsiders, this is completely worthless.']",1,"The claim that FGXpress Power Strips can reduce pain or improve wound healing is not supported by any studies, and the manufacturer's before/after images lack accurate documentation and independent control, making their value questionable.",We could not find a single study on these patches - nor any reason to assume that they are effective.
Does treatment according to the fascial distortion model help with chronic shoulder pain?,"['In the study, this form of fascia therapy shows advantages over classic treatment: the mobility of the shoulder is improved more, as is functionality.', 'The most important criterion was how far the mobility of the shoulder can be improved: in the group treated according to fascia distortion model, mobility improved on average in patients by 30 percent in six weeks, in the comparison group only by 15 percent.', 'Participants in the FDM group also performed significantly and clinically relevantly better in terms of functionality and strength.']",0,"The study indicates that fascial distortion model treatment results in greater shoulder mobility and functionality improvement compared to classic treatment, with an average 30% improvement in six weeks for the FDM group versus 15% in the comparison group.","Currently, there is only one randomized controlled trial of this type of therapy. It suggests that fascia therapy may help with some shoulder conditions."
Are there effective alternatives to the breathing mask (CPAP) for sleep apnea?,"['The authors of an overview of 2013 see such interventions as a possible alternative for those patients who reject the breathing mask: During the day of fatigue they lead to a similar improvement as standard therapy, but they are not so good at reducing breath loss [2].', 'However, since the breath loss has a decisive influence on subsequent diseases, standard therapy is preferable if possible.', 'Overall, oxygen therapy is significantly less helpful than CPAP [3].', 'Conclusion For patients who reject standard therapy with breathing mask, there are numerous other treatment options available – but these are not as effective in the decisive symptoms as CPAP.']",2,"While some alternatives for sleep apnea patients who reject CPAP masks can provide similar improvements in fatigue during the day, they are less effective in reducing breath loss, a crucial factor for subsequent diseases, as stated in the first and second sentences.","Although numerous other forms of treatment are available, some of them are too little researched or are clearly inferior to the standard therapy with CPAP."
Does closure of the foramen ovale prevent further strokes in people who have had a stroke of unknown cause?,"['If such patients have a PFO, surgical closure can be used to prevent further strokes.', 'Nevertheless, the data speak for the procedure; thus, even if the cause of the stroke is unknown, the risk of a further stroke can be reduced in at least those people who have an open foramen ovale.', 'All three individual studies provide very similar results and indicate that the closure avoids another stroke rather than just anticoagulant therapy with medications.']",0,"The sentences suggest that closure of the foramen ovale can prevent further strokes in people who have had a stroke of unknown cause, as long as they have a PFO, based on the results of individual studies comparing closure to anticoagulant therapy.","According to three large studies, closure of the patent foramen ovale can prevent another stroke better than purely drug treatment can."
Does taking magnesium salts decrease the frequency and intensity of muscle cramps with unknown cause?,"['Insufficient evidence The examination shows that the evidence of efficacy is rather meager: We have not found any high-quality studies that have investigated the effect of magnesium salts on exertive muscle spasms, for example in athletes.', 'It is therefore unclear whether athletes benefit from the intake of magnesium supplements.']",2,"The claim that magnesium salts decrease the frequency and intensity of muscle cramps with unknown cause is not supported, as there is insufficient high-quality evidence demonstrating the effect of magnesium salts on exertive muscle spasms, leaving it unclear whether athletes benefit from magnesium supplements.","No high-quality studies have been found on the efficacy of magnesium salts for exercise-induced muscle cramps, such as in athletes. For leg muscle cramps without an identifiable cause, researchers have been unable to demonstrate any effect of magnesium beyond placebo in studies.

Does the active ingredient rivaroxaban (drug Xarelto) have a higher risk of dangerous bleeding than other anticoagulants?,"['A summary analysis of studies published so far on rivaroxaban in particular also finds overall less fatal bleeding than in the use of vitamin K antagonists (cumarine) [4], although there has been no overall difference in the number of premature deaths.', 'The comparison of rivaroxaban with other factor Xa inhibitors shows only very small differences: According to a recent summary of several meta-analyses, the active substance of Xarelto does not perform best, but the result is uncertain.', 'Overall, these drugs have the same effect as the older vitamin K antagonist treatment, but with a significantly lower risk of bleeding – the risk is almost halved.', 'According to this, the new drugs avoid strokes more effectively than the older ones, with regard to the risk of bleeding there is no difference.']",2,"The active ingredient rivaroxaban (Xarelto) does not have a higher risk of dangerous bleeding compared to other anticoagulants, as summarized studies show no significant difference in bleeding risk or premature deaths between rivaroxaban and vitamin K antagonists or other factor Xa inhibitors.","High-quality studies in the most common uses of rivaroxaban show either an equal or even lower risk of bleeding than other blood-clotting medications. However, this does not mean it is the best choice in all cases. Research is still needed for bleeding in the stomach or intestines."
Does brain training boost intelligence?,"['Those who train their memory only get better in these exercises, i.e.', 'The training does not affect other mental tasks such as speech fluid or arithmetic.', 'With a total of only 75 participants it is not very extensive, but strengthens the results of the overview work: even here, a 20-unit training did not improve the general intelligence [2].', 'Another review of 2013 casts doubt on how much cognitive training can be helpful for children and adolescents with various mental developmental disorders [3].']",2,"The claim that brain training boosts intelligence is refuted by the sentences, as a study of 75 participants showed no improvement in general intelligence after a 20-unit training, and another review questioned the helpfulness of cognitive training for children and adolescents with mental developmental disorders.","There are many ways of brain training, but no evidence that it can improve intelligence. The most research in science is about a specific training of the ""working memory"", here the studies speak against a general improvement of intelligence."
Does petroleum help against cancer?,"['One of the legends of Petroleum says that the workers in oil fields do not have cancer.', 'The legend is not confirmed; large studies show that cancers in oil workers are as common as in other parts of the population [1] [2] [3], the risk of cancer is neither greater nor less for workers in the oil industry.', '[a] In Internet forums, kerosene is praised as a curative detox, but this can be thought of as ""detoxins"", we have already described here: https://www.medizin-transparent.at/mdzt4n5p4rnt/detox-of-mythos-vom-detoxins Studies in detail There are no studies on kerosene as a drug for cancer – for good reason, because a positive effect is far less likely than an additional health risk.']",1,"The claim that petroleum helps against cancer is not supported by the provided sentences, as studies show no difference in cancer rates between oil workers and the general population, and there is no scientific evidence for kerosene as a cancer treatment.","This rather absurd assumption has not been tested in studies.

Is aluminum intake responsible for the development of Alzheimer's disease?,"['Cause unknown As far as the cause of pathological memory loss is concerned, research is still relatively in the dark.', ""However, due to the implementation of the study, it cannot be concluded that small traces of aluminium are actually the triggering cause of Alzheimer's disease.""]",1,"The current research does not conclusively link small traces of aluminum intake as the triggering cause of Alzheimer's disease, leaving the actual cause undetermined.","Scientific studies cannot prove with certainty a connection between the metal aluminum and the disease Alzheimer, but they cannot exclude it either."
Can regular exercise prevent or relieve migraine symptoms?,"['In a systematic overview from 2008 [ 2 ] of 7 studies with very low participation numbers, the authors conclude that sporting activity can probably lead to a slight reduction in the pain intensity of further migraine attacks.', 'A randomized-controlled study [ 3 ] in 30 migraine patients found at least a small reduction in the pain intensity of future migraine seizures for a combination program of aerobic training followed by muscle relaxation.', 'In another, less rigorous study [ 4 ] in 16 patients, compared to migraine patients who did not participate in any sports program, there was also a small reduction in pain intensity.', 'In a recent study from 2009 [ 5 ], the scientists found a similar improvement in the frequency of monthly migraine attacks.', 'Too little comprehensive investigations for clear effect In summary, a certain effectiveness of regularly operated endurance sports such as jogging or cycling for prevention of migraine attacks seems likely.']",0,"The claim is supported by a combination of a systematic overview, randomized-controlled studies, and a less rigorous study, suggesting that regular exercise, particularly aerobic training followed by muscle relaxation, can lead to a slight reduction in pain intensity and frequency of migraine attacks.","In some, but not all, studies, regular exercise seems to at least somewhat reduce the pain intensity of future migraine attacks. Whether the frequency of migraine attacks can also be reduced cannot be assessed with certainty. for this, larger, better validated studies would have to be conducted."
Does less than 7h of sleep daily increase mental performance?,"['Already six hours of sleep reduce brain performance The results of a small randomized-controlled study [1] clearly contradict the claim of performance-enhancing sleep loss.', 'After only a few nights it became apparent: the shorter the participants could sleep at night, the worse they did in the tests compared to the group with eight hours of sleep.', 'The performance of the sleep deficit group was significantly worse after five days compared to the control group, although the impact is limited by the small size of the control group.', 'This shows that lack of sleep actually seemed to be the cause of the worse mental performance.', 'Overall, if you sleep only six or less hours per night, you will hardly be wiser, but it seems to impair your mental performance.']",2,"The sentences provide evidence that less than 7h of sleep daily decreases mental performance, contradicting the claim.",Two small randomized-controlled studies indicate that mental performance decreases with the number of sleepless hours per night and the number of nights with insufficient sleep. No single scientific study provides evidence of an increase in mental performance due to shorter sleep duration.
Does regular intake of extra virgin olive oil protect against coronary heart disease such as heart attack?,"['Probably related to reduced risk of heart attack Many research groups have already studied the question of whether olive oil can actually reduce the risk of heart attacks and other heart diseases over the last two decades.', 'When eating more than 30 grams of olive oil per day, the risk of heart disease was only about half as high as in people who consumed less than 15 grams per day or no olive oil at all.', 'The olive oil-rich diet resulted in a significant reduction in the risk of heart attack and death for almost five years by just under a third compared to a conventional diet.', 'Study participants with high olive oil consumption were significantly less likely to be found in the group of heart attack patients, the scientists therefore concluded that the oil had a significant protective effect.', 'The results of the two most reliable and largest cohort studies [ 2, 3 ] indicate a likely protective effect of increased consumption of cold-pressed olive oil over several years.']",0,"The claim is supported by several studies indicating a reduced risk of heart disease and heart attack associated with regular intake of extra virgin olive oil, as well as a significant protective effect concluded by scientists.","Regular consumption of cold-pressed olive oil may possibly prevent coronary heart disease.

Do frequent ejaculations have a protective effect against prostate cancer?,"['Result: Men with frequent ejaculations between 20 and 30 years of age have a one-third reduced prostate cancer risk compared to those with rare ejaculations [1].', ""Taking the result seriously, it doesn't show that much self-satisfaction protects, but rather that men with very few ejaculations could have a slightly higher risk of prostate cancer."", 'Here it turns out that frequent ejaculations from the age of four years onwards or over the entire life span may reduce the risk of prostate cancer [3].', 'In sum, the study provides evidence that with increasing ejaculation frequency, the risk of prostate cancer could actually decrease.']",0,"The claim is partially supported by the evidence, as some studies suggest a decrease in prostate cancer risk with increasing ejaculation frequency from an early age or over the entire lifespan, but the protective effect is not explicitly attributed to frequent self-satisfaction.","A cohort study suggests that more frequent ejaculations starting at age 40, or over a lifetime, could potentially lower the risk of prostate cancer. This is not exclusive to ejaculations from masturbation, but from any sexual activity."
Do today's children have a shorter life expectancy than their parents?,"['Overweight leads to a higher rate of premature deaths – which reduces life expectancy on average by 3 to 9 months.', 'So it would be a reversal of the trend: for the first time in a long time, children would have a life expectancy less than their parents.', 'There are some reasons to assume that it will be worse than the 3 to 9 months less: Obesity is becoming more common and occurs in increasingly younger children [1].', 'If this trend continues, there may be a reduction in life expectancy of three to five years.']",0,"While overweight is associated with a higher rate of premature deaths and obesity is becoming more prevalent in younger children, current data does not support a reduction in life expectancy of three to five years for today's children compared to their parents.","Obesity and physical inactivity are increasing risk factors worldwide that can shorten life. In 2005, a study from the USA concluded that life expectancy could be reduced by 3 to 9 months when these risks were included."
Do rising temperatures and CO2 levels increase the risk of pollen allergy?,"['It is unclear whether the increase in CO2 has already caused a noticeable increase in the amount of pollen released.', 'Influence on allergy risk unclear However, whether the increasing pollen exposure also increases the risk of developing pollen allergy for non-allergic agents is unclear.', 'Whether higher levels of pollen increase the probability of hay fever is so far unclear [5].', 'There is nothing to read about pollen becoming more aggressive in so far published studies.']",1,"While there is evidence suggesting that increased pollen exposure may not necessarily increase the risk of developing pollen allergy for non-allergic individuals, the relationship between rising temperatures, CO2 levels, and pollen aggressiveness remains unclear due to a lack of relevant studies.","Rising temperatures and increased CO2 concentrations cause plants to produce larger amounts of pollen over a longer period of time. However, it is unclear whether larger amounts of pollen and a longer pollen season increase the likelihood of developing pollen allergy."
Does training on vibration platforms cause a noticeable buildup of muscle strength?,"['Therefore, training on vibration platforms could actually strengthen the muscle strength of the leg muscles.', 'However, compared to conventional strengthening training, the results do not indicate superiority of vibration platforms.', 'According to the results of this study, it could be concluded at most that training on a vibration platform in combination with a diet can lead to weight loss, which could also be achieved by a conventional fitness program or a mere diet without exercise program.']",0,"While training on vibration platforms may strengthen leg muscles to some extent, there is no evidence suggesting it is more effective than conventional strengthening training, and its primary benefit seems to be weight loss when combined with a diet, which can also be achieved through conventional fitness programs or diets without exercise.","Vibration training may be helpful for building muscle strength in the legs, but it is not better than conventional training for this purpose. Whether the method is also suitable for weight reduction has not been sufficiently studied."
Does glucosamine prolong life?,"['This is exactly what happens once again in the article on glucosamine as a life prolonger: The study was conducted on nematodes (fade worms) and mice and in which glucosamine led to an extended life span [1].', 'The conclusion of the researchers: If glucosamine has the same effect in two different species and these processes are also conceivable in humans, then glucosamine is highly likely to prolong life expectancy in humans.', 'Yes, with many limitations There is a cohort study on humans on this question: In 2010, a first evaluation looked at the influence of 20 vitamins or dietary supplements on life expectancy [3]; of these 20 only glucosamine and chondroitin showed a possible relationship with life expectancy.', 'The researchers speculate that glucosamine prolongs life expectancy just as was found in aspirin [2].', 'Until then, the life-prolonging effect of glucosamine remains optimistic speculation with little evidence.']",0,"While some studies suggest a possible relationship between glucosamine and life expectancy in nematodes and mice, human cohort studies provide limited evidence, and the life-prolonging effect remains speculative.","Although research here is still in its infancy and there is only one cohort study in humans besides basic studies, this shows possible effects. Further studies with better methods and other groups of participants are necessary."
Does Kinesio tape help in the treatment of joint and muscle injuries?,"['Therefore, it cannot be said whether the tape could contribute to the improvement of the pain after a long period of time.', 'Overall, the efficacy of Kinesio tape in musculoskeletal pain and injuries is at best unclear.', 'Since no studies have been carried out for more than 6 days, however, nothing can be said about a possible longer-term effect of the tape.']",1,"While some studies suggest short-term pain improvement with Kinesio tape use in musculoskeletal injuries, there is no clear evidence indicating its long-term efficacy or contribution to healing joint and muscle injuries, leaving its overall impact unclear.",There is no evidence that kinesio tape can reduce pain within a few days.

Are animal-assisted therapies effective for mental illness?,"['The authors conclude from the data that animal assisted therapies may be effective in some diseases, including mental disorders and behavioural disorders such as depression, schizophrenia and addiction.', 'There is still no reliable data on the efficacy of animal-based therapy, for example in patients with cancer and advanced fatal diseases, in terms of state of health and quality of life.']",0,"The first sentence provides evidence that animal-assisted therapies may be effective for mental and behavioral disorders, but the second sentence indicates a lack of reliable data for their efficacy in patients with cancer and advanced fatal diseases, leaving the claim's applicability to all mental illnesses unsupported by the given sentences.","Studies on the effects of animal-assisted therapies are only partially conclusive. It seems plausible that animal-assisted therapies can be supportive for some mental illnesses; however, very large or rapid effects are unlikely."
Can lack of sleep cause obesity?,"['So, most likely, lack of sleep is just one of many different factors that can affect weight gain.', 'Cause unclear The mere fact that people with a lack of sleep are more likely to be overweight or gain more weight than those who sleep, however, does not necessarily mean that the lack of sleep is the real cause of obesity.', 'People who sleep too little usually have an unhealthy lifestyle in general, so other factors can also play a role in increasing weight gain.', ""Whether lack of sleep actually makes you fat can't be said from previous study results – even if there is evidence that people who sleep little may become overweight rather than people with normal sleep.""]",1,"While research suggests a correlation between lack of sleep and increased likelihood of obesity, it does not definitively establish lack of sleep as the cause, as other factors associated with poor sleep habits could also contribute to weight gain.",People who regularly get too little sleep may be more likely to be overweight than those who get enough sleep. But whether lack of sleep itself causes obesity is unclear.
Is breaking an energy-saving lamp harmful to health?,"['[3] If an energy-saving lamp breaks, the mercury contained therein escapes, among other things, in the form of mercury vapour.', 'However, these experiments did not directly investigate whether this could lead to signs of poisoning in humans.', 'Even if the safety limit has been exceeded in some cases, mercury vapour concentrations in the ambient air did not reach levels for which a health hazard is considered probable in any study.']",1,"While mercury vapor is released when an energy-saving lamp breaks, studies have not established a probable health hazard from increased mercury vapor concentrations in ambient air, even when safety limits were exceeded.","If an energy-saving lamp breaks, mercury vapor is released in quantities that can exceed the limits considered safe. Whether this can cause damage to health has not been directly investigated. However, after removal of the broken glass and good ventilation of the room, the value quickly falls back below the limit value."
Do air ions cause an improvement of allergies?,['Hardly any studies on anti-allergic effects No clinical studies have been performed to date on the alleged anti-allergic effects of air ions.'],1,"The claim that air ions cause an improvement of allergies is not supported by any clinical studies specifically investigating their alleged anti-allergic effects, as stated in the sentences provided.","Whether ionized air can reduce allergic symptoms is unclear, as no studies exist on this question.

Do smoking bans lead to fewer preterm births?,"['Smoking bans mean that mothers smoke less in pregnancy and that unborn women are exposed to less passive smoke.', 'It is a methodically very good work, but there are some limitations to the statements: the results of the individual studies vary greatly, whether the real effect is really 10% each, will only be able to clarify future studies.']",0,"The claim is partially supported by the first sentence, stating that smoking bans result in less smoking during pregnancy and reduced exposure to passive smoke for unborn women; however, the second sentence indicates variability in the results of individual studies and the need for future studies to confirm the exact effect.","A large review shows a 10% reduced risk of preterm birth. Due to some limitations, the evidence is nevertheless low, further studies from different countries will probably soon bring clarity."
Does caffeine make us die sooner???,"['However, this does not yet clarify whether caffeine shortens or prolongs life.', 'This does not mean that it is caffeine that reduces the risk of mortality; it only shows that people who drink a lot of coffee differ in their risk from people who drink little coffee.', 'Why this is so and what role caffeine itself plays is not clarified – even if it could be shown by which mechanisms caffeine may have its positive effect [c].']",1,"While some studies suggest a potential positive effect of caffeine consumption, the relationship between caffeine and lifespan, whether shortened or prolonged, remains unclear due to a lack of clarification on caffeine's role and the differences between heavy and light coffee drinkers.","In moderate amounts, alcohol could reduce the likelihood of dying prematurely. In higher doses, however, it clearly increases this risk. This is unclear for caffeine."
Does acupuncture help against hay fever?,"['As with other acupuncture studies, it is therefore questionable whether the improvement of hay fever symptoms was due to the needle stitches themselves.', 'In order to distinguish between the placebo effect and the specific effect of acupuncture in the future, further studies with better study designs are necessary.']",1,"The improvement of hay fever symptoms observed in the study may be attributed to a placebo effect rather than the needle stitches themselves, suggesting that further research with improved study designs is needed to determine the specific effect of acupuncture.",We have not found any meaningful studies that can provide evidence of improvement in hay fever.
Do earrings cause discomfort by destroying acupuncture points or meridians?,"['However, we could not find any studies that would have investigated earrings and their effects on meridians or acupuncture points.']",1,"The claim that earrings cause discomfort by destroying acupuncture points or meridians cannot be supported or refuted with the given information, as there are no studies investigating the relationship between earrings and meridians or acupuncture points.","Earrings very often lead to complications, fortunately most of them are harmless.

Does excessive beer or alcohol consumption lead to obesity?,"['In some studies, it seems to be exactly the opposite, beer lovers weigh less than little drinkers at the time of the survey.', 'In such a study, men who drank less than three litres a week even seemed to lose weight, and not to increase in weekly amounts of six litres or more.', 'Studies comparing beer with other non-alcoholic beverages other than non-alcoholic beer do not show a clear difference in weight.', 'One reason, according to the authors of an overview of 2011 [2], could be that wine drinkers may tend to become a healthier diet overall.', 'It is also possible that alcohol only has an influence on fat folds on the abdomen and hips from a large amount of time, but it does not lead to weight gain in moderation.']",1,"Excessive beer or alcohol consumption may not directly lead to overall obesity, as some studies suggest beer lovers have similar or even lower weights than lighter drinkers, and alcohol's impact on fat folds might only be noticeable over a long period. However, wine drinkers may adopt healthier diets, which could influence the relationship between alcohol and weight.","In some studies, alcohol consumption does seem to be related to weight gain. In other studies, however, there is either no effect or even the opposite effect. The study situation is contradictory."
Do omega-3 fatty acids or a diet rich in fish help with rheumatoid arthritis?,"['Is this supported by scientific data?', 'Anti-rheumatism effect unproven A Korean team of researchers summarized the results of previously published randomized-controlled studies [1] that investigated the effects of omega-3 fatty acid preparations in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.', 'Their conclusion: there is no valid evidence for such a positive effect in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.']",1,The conclusion of a Korean research team based on randomized-controlled studies is that there is no valid evidence to support the positive effect of omega-3 fatty acids or a diet rich in fish in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.,"According to the majority of studies, preparations with omega-3 fatty acids cannot improve pain and other symptoms in rheumatoid arthritis. However, the results are sometimes contradictory. The effectiveness of preparations made from the New Zealand green-lipped mussel is also unclear. Whether a diet rich in fish helps is insufficiently studied."
"Does processed red meat (sausages, ham, bacon) increase the risk of cardiovascular disease???","['Possible risk only for processed meat products Meat is not equal to meat.', 'On closer examination, it can be seen that meat products processed with salt, smoked or cured meat may actually increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.', 'A Polish-Swedish research team found a potentially increased probability of disease not only for processed meat products, but also for unprocessed red meat [1].']",0,"The increased risk of cardiovascular disease is specifically associated with processed meat products preserved with salt, smoke, or cure, as suggested by a Polish-Swedish research team, but their findings also imply a potential risk for unprocessed red meat.","Whether unprocessed red meat increases the likelihood of cardiovascular disease is unclear, and study results are conflicting. However, processed red meat such as ham, bacon or sausages could increase the risk."
Does hawthorn extract help patients with heart muscle weakness (heart failure)?,"['Accordingly, it is also unclear over which time period and at which dose the herbal medicinal product should be taken and which patient groups could benefit from a hawthorn intake.', 'In most studies, patients suffering from heart failure took hawthorn preparations as an accompanying therapy in addition to their cardiac medications.', ""So we can't say whether the drug, the hawthorn extract or just the random factor affected the respective result."", 'In fact, those patients who had taken hawthorn were less short of breath, more resilient and showed increased physical performance in the stress ECG.', 'In this study, the intake of hawthorn did not improve the physical resilience or the quality of life of those affected.']",1,"While some studies suggest improvements in symptoms like shortness of breath and physical performance for heart failure patients taking hawthorn extract, other research indicates no improvement in physical resilience or quality of life, making it unclear which patient groups might benefit and the optimal dosage and time period for intake.",The results of the studies found differ significantly and leave more questions open than they answer.
Is glyphosate carcinogenic?,"['Of mice... in the debate about the different assessments, a lot is about studies in rats and mice.', 'Animal studies play a greater role in assessing risks than when it comes to the effectiveness of drugs.', 'Secondly, the animal studies show an increased risk of cancer only when the experimental animals receive a very high dose of glyphosate.', '...and humans In addition to animal studies, there are numerous studies with people on glyphosate The IARC derives from studies in humans a low evidence of an increased risk.', 'The disadvantage: not only the factor that you want to examine, but many other factors can influence the result – for example, when it comes to cancer, lifestyle, smoking, and much more play a role and, to a certain extent, mask the effect of glyphosate.']",1,"While animal studies suggest an increased cancer risk with high glyphosate doses, human studies provide low evidence of a heightened risk, which may be influenced by various confounding factors.","Depending on how much animal experiments and laboratory tests are weighted against studies on humans, one arrives at different assessments. With regard to human studies, we consider the question to be unresolved at present."
Is electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) in combination with ordinary fitness training more efficient than fitness training alone?,"['However, according to a meta-analysis summarising the results of 17 studies, the effect is no greater than in conventional strengthening exercises [ 1 ].', 'Full-body EMS as a fitness method hardly investigated While the electrical stimulation of individual muscle groups for therapeutic purposes was investigated by some research groups, there are hardly any scientific studies on the whole-body EMS as a fitness training replacement.']",1,"The claim is not supported by the first sentence, which states that a meta-analysis of 17 studies found no greater effect from EMS in combination with fitness training compared to conventional strengthening exercises alone.","There is evidence for the principle effectiveness of EMS for muscle strengthening. For a superiority of the combination of EMS and ordinary training compared to fitness training alone, the evidence is contradictory."
Can they delay the progression of eye disease?,"['Progress probably slows down In fact, the summarized results of previously published studies show that a combination of vitamin C, E, beta-carotene and zinc can probably maintain the increasingly deteriorating vision longer.', 'For those with early signs of macular degeneration, this would mean: Without vitamins and minerals, the disease would progress strongly in 15 out of 1000 patients within six years With vitamins and minerals, it would be 11 out of 1000, i.e.']",0,"The summarized results of studies indicate that a combination of certain vitamins and minerals can potentially slow down the progression of eye disease and maintain deteriorating vision longer, as evidenced by a decrease in disease progression from 15 to 11 out of 1000 patients within six years.","Vitamin E and beta-carotene cannot prevent the development of age-related macular degeneration. However, in combination with zinc and vitamin C, they probably allow certain forms of an existing disease to progress somewhat more slowly."
Does yoga change the genetic makeup?,"['The genes themselves remain unchanged, only their activity fluctuates; just as in each cell the activity of the different genes is adjusted according to current needs.', 'The difference between a liver cell and a muscle cell is not due to different genes, but to different gene activity.', 'The study shows that shortly after the activity, the gene activity differs from certain white blood cells in these two groups.']",1,"The genes themselves remain unchanged in yoga practitioners, with only their activity fluctuating according to current needs, which is consistent with the claim.",Yoga - like any other physical activity - can influence the activity of genes. But the genes themselves are not changed by it.
Which of the three most common laser eye surgeries produces the best results and has the fewest side effects?,"['However, the study situation is still rather thin, new and large studies could still change somewhat in this assessment.', 'At present, all three methods lead to very good results, which, according to the first long-term studies [3], are likely to be sustainable.', 'Results from a few years ago are no longer meaningful today because the treatment method has changed.', 'Long-term studies therefore always refer to the state of the art at that time, but already suggest that laser treatments are safe and sustainable [1] [2] [3].']",0,"While current long-term studies indicate that all three laser eye surgeries lead to safe and sustainable results, the study situation is still evolving, and recent treatment method changes make it difficult to rely on older results.","If only new studies are considered, all three techniques are equally successful. Probable advantages of LASIK: less pain after surgery and good vision more quickly."
"Can electromagnetic fields with a specific pattern (pulsed electromagnetic fields, PEMF) heal injuries?","['Evidence that this pattern in particular has a good therapeutic effect has not been provided.', 'In fact, only a randomized-controlled study on fatigue in multiple sclerosis (MS) [1] and some laboratory results can be found.', 'Apart from the fact that a study on fatigue in a particular disease naturally does not say anything about effects on completely different symptoms, this one study is not yet meaningful: there were very few participants (37) and the intake of medications differed in the experimental and control groups.', 'Many approaches, little evidence Even if the whole variety of similar treatments is considered, there are not enough good studies to prove an effect of PEMF therapies.', 'For a meaningful assessment of PEMF as a form of therapy, studies with good methodology, a higher number of participants and a comparison of the different forms of application (among others) are missing.']",1,"The claim that pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMF) can heal injuries is not supported by the provided evidence, as there is only one small study on fatigue in multiple sclerosis and some laboratory results, with no substantial evidence for other symptoms or diseases, and a lack of high-quality studies comparing different forms of PEMF application.","No good injury studies can be found on the device. The only randomized-controlled study treats fatigue in patients with the incurable nerve disease multiple sclerosis and is not very conclusive. Even for the whole range of similar treatment methods, there is no sufficient evidence of efficacy."
Does the drug fingolimod reduce the progression of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis similarly or better than previous drugs?,"['The recently newly approved active substance Fingolimod in Europe causes white blood cells (T cells) to be held back in the lymph nodes, which prevents them from causing inflammation by immigrating to the brain.', 'By means of systematic literature research, we wanted to find out whether fingolimod is similar to or better than previous multiple sclerosis – drugs can inhibit the progression of the disease.']",0,"The first sentence provides a mechanism for how fingolimod may affect multiple sclerosis, but it does not directly compare fingolimod's effectiveness to previous drugs, making it difficult to determine if the claim is supported or refuted based solely on this information.","Two manufacturer-funded clinical trials attest Fingolimod such efficacy that exceeds that of interferon beta therapy. However, the drug can also cause serious side effects."
Can some forms of headache be successfully treated with heat?,"['Accordingly, there is no scientific evidence of the effectiveness of this measure.', 'However, there is no sufficient evidence to support this claim.', 'A Cochrane overview work from 2004 [1] investigates all non-invasive physical treatment methods for all forms of headache: Heat treatment plays only a very small role according to this study (dryer is not mentioned) – heat was tested in combination with other measures: In one study, the combination of heat, home training and stretching is worse than a combination of biofeedback and relaxation.']",1,"While some studies have shown that heat can be beneficial for certain types of headaches when used in combination with other measures, a Cochrane overview work from 2004 found that heat has only a minor role in treating headaches, and dryer was not even mentioned in the study.","Heat on tense muscles is pleasant, but no evidence exists that the tension is released and the headache is relieved."
Does electro-acupuncture on the ear help against pain?,"['Thus, the repeated electrical irritation of acupuncture points on the ear seems to be able to stop some chronic neck or cross pain [ 2, 3 ].', 'The pain could not be brought to total disappearance, but the study participants needed less painkillers than without electro-acupuncture over the duration of a few weeks.', 'Acupuncture on the ear probably effective against pain Overall, different acupuncture methods on the ear may effectively reduce pain.']",0,"The sentences provide evidence that electro-acupuncture on the ear can reduce the need for painkillers in people with chronic neck or cross pain, but they do not indicate that it can completely eliminate pain.","Electro-ear acupuncture could be supportive against chronic pain such as neck or low back pain. The method cannot completely replace painkillers. For surgery-related pain, the effectiveness is uncertain."
Is screening by optical coherence tomography superior to conventional examinations for the early detection of diabetic macular edema?,"['Early detection: Optical coherence tomography unreliable Most diabetes patients with such pathological retinal damage will not notice symptoms such as dark spots in the field of vision or impairment of sharp vision long after the start.', 'However, laser treatment is not without risk, in some cases it may also result in an unwanted reduction in vision or other side effects that affect vision.']",2,"The claim is refuted by the first sentence, which states that early detection of diabetic macular edema with optical coherence tomography can be unreliable, as many patients with pathological retinal damage may not notice symptoms for a long time.","No, screening by optical coherence tomography alone is too inaccurate. An examination using an ophthalmoscope and pupil dilating eye drops or with the help of fundus photography is a safer method."
Does the treatment of diabetes-related retinal diseases by injection of VEGF inhibitors provide an advantage compared to conventional laser treatment?,"['The majority (5 out of 100 inhabitants) suffer from type 2 diabetes (formerly also called age diabetes), which is practically always lifestyle-related and in most cases is accompanied by overweight, one-sided diet and lack of exercise [ 4 ].', 'The presentation of the effectiveness of VEGF inhibitor injections as a new treatment method is also clearly exaggerated and biased – the newspaper article does not inform about risks and uncertainties.']",0,"The claim does not provide a direct comparison between VEGF inhibitor injections and conventional laser treatment for diabetes-related retinal diseases, and the sentences do not offer information about the relative efficacy or risks of these treatments.","There is evidence of better short-term efficacy for VEGF inhibitor injections compared with laser coagulation, but the method is insufficiently studied.
