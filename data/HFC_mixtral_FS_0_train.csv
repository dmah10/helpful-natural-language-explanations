Can masks reduce corona infections when worn by a large proportion of the population?,"['Studies show slow spread After three years of pandemic, there are now relatively meaningful data that masks can slow down the spread of the Corona virus.', 'Surgical masks, in turn, seem to reduce the risk of infecting themselves with the corona virus.']",0,"The first sentence provides evidence that masks can slow down the spread of the Corona virus, supporting the claim that masks can reduce corona infections when worn by a large proportion of the population.","International studies suggest that the number of corona infections decreases when many people wear masks - whether fabric, surgical or FFP2 masks. However, it is not possible to precisely quantify how great the protective effect actually is. It probably depends on the type of masks and the proportion of people who wear them."
Can homeopathic preparations with Anamirta cocculus help against dizziness?,"['But without success: We could not find any meaningful scientific evidence for effectiveness in dizziness.', 'It is now well proven by studies that homeopathic preparations usually do not work better than a sham medication (placebo) [8].', 'However, it is not well established that betahistine is effective against dizziness [11.13].', 'The fact that betahist helps with dizziness is not well documented [11, 13].']",1,"The claim of homeopathic preparations with Anamirta cocculus helping against dizziness is not supported as there is no meaningful scientific evidence of their effectiveness, and they typically do not work better than a placebo.","We have found only one study that has investigated this. However, it is so poor that no reliable statement is possible."
Can zeolite alleviate or prevent health problems?,"['However, none of these can provide any evidence – because the studies have no significance (for reasons see section Studies in detail ).', 'It does not find an advantage for zeolite – but the results are hardly meaningful.', 'However, it is not researched whether the regular intake of zeolite can lead to a nutrient deficiency or has an undesirable effect on digestion.']",1,"The claim that zeolite can alleviate or prevent health problems is not supported by the provided sentences, as there is no significant evidence found in studies and no research on potential nutrient deficiencies or digestive effects due to regular zeolite intake.",Studies to date cannot provide any evidence that taking zeolite prevents or alleviates complaints. A detoxifying effect is not scientifically plausible.
"Does starting school later improve health, learning success, and quality of life in adolescents?","['However, teenagers and parents now have to be very strong: despite 27 studies involving hundreds of thousands of students, no clear results can be derived from research.', 'The problem: The studies usually come to contradictory results.', 'So until better research results are available, all troubled young people and parents will only have the option of remaining out of bed early – or to hope that, despite lack of evidence, the school management will still have an insight into it.', 'It is difficult to examine whether a later start to school will have a positive effect.', 'The Problems: Unknown Influencing Factors: If differences occur in previous-after-studies, these do not have to be due to the later start of school – they may also have been caused by other changes over the course of the study period.']",1,The claim cannot be definitively supported or refuted due to contradictory results from existing studies and the presence of unknown influencing factors.,"The question has been investigated in several large studies. Due to methodological deficiencies and contradictory results, no firm conclusions can be drawn. This means that science can currently neither speak for nor against a benefit of a later school start."
Does the F.X. Mayr cure have health benefits? Can it prevent diseases or treat them?,"['Thus, the claim that the method can help with various diseases is not scientifically justified.', 'These studies cannot answer whether these changes also affect health.', 'Mayr cure or other fasting methods improve health in the long term, however, cannot be concluded.']",1,"The provided sentences offer no scientific evidence to support the claim that the F.X. Mayr cure has health benefits, prevents diseases, or treats them, and they suggest that the long-term health effects of fasting methods like the Mayr cure are inconclusive.","It is neither examined nor proven whether the special fasting method after F.X. Mayr holds, which it promises: Namely assistance with all possible illnesses of allergies, over rheumatism up to sleep disturbances. The advertised detoxification and ""purification"" of the body by the chamfering cure are besides scientifically not plausible."
Does extract from the Damiana plant (Turnera diffusa) help with erectile dysfunction?,"['Efficacy does not appear to have been studied or demonstrated.', 'The studies in detail We could not find any studies on Damiana extract against erectile dysfunction in men.', 'Studies on the product Neradin also appear to be missing.']",1,"The claim cannot be supported since there are no studies demonstrating the efficacy of Damiana extract for erectile dysfunction in men, and studies on the related product Neradin are also missing.","The extract from the Damiana plant (Turnera diffusa) is advertised as a remedy for erectile dysfunction for men. However, this claimed effect on potency is by no means proven. It has apparently never been tested on humans. This also applies to homeopathic remedies such as the product Neradin."
Is the homeopathic remedy Neradin effective for erectile dysfunction?,"['No studies on Neradin Also our search for studies on the product Neradin remained resultless.', 'Studies on the product Neradin also appear to be missing.']",1,"The claim cannot be supported because no studies on the effectiveness of Neradin for erectile dysfunction were found, and its impact remains unproven by available research.","The extract from the Damiana plant (Turnera diffusa) is advertised as a remedy for erectile dysfunction for men. However, this claimed effect on potency is by no means proven. It has apparently never been tested on humans. This also applies to homeopathic remedies such as the product Neradin."
Can monk's pepper reduce PMS symptoms? PMS is the abbreviation for premenstrual syndrome. This refers to complaints that occur in the days before menstruation.,"['Reference to efficacy in PMS According to previous studies, monk peppers could actually help in PMS.', 'The summarized study results indicate that the symptoms with monk pepper are reduced in more patients than with a sham medication (placebo).', 'Therefore, it would be possible for monk peppers to act against PMS symptoms such as breast spacing.']",0,"The summarized results of previous studies suggest that monk pepper may reduce PMS symptoms more effectively than a placebo, providing support for the claim.","In the studies to date, monk's pepper seems to relieve PMS symptoms better than a placebo. However, this is not well proven, because the studies have significant weaknesses. There is no evidence of an effect on menstrual disorders. Significant studies are lacking."
Can probiotics lower blood sugar in type 2 diabetes?,"['And if so, can probiotics reverse this change and reduce blood sugar levels again?', 'At the most small effect, they may actually be able to.', 'However, the effect of the capsules and tablets does not seem to be large: in the previous studies, they were able to reduce the long-term sugar level HbA1c by an average of 0.55 points.']",0,"While some studies suggest probiotics may have a small effect in reducing HbA1c levels by an average of 0.55 points in type 2 diabetes, the impact of capsules and tablets does not seem to be large.","The summarized results of studies to date suggest that probiotics in capsule or tablet form could lower blood sugar somewhat. At least if they are taken over a period of two to three months. However, the effect is not well established. Probiotic dairy products and probiotic powder for dissolving do not seem to have any demonstrable effect."
Can the so-called Tupler technique help against rectus diastasis?,"['No studies on the Tupler technique As intense as we were looking for, we could not find the promised studies on the Tupler technique.', 'The claim that this is a scientifically proven therapy for rectus diastase is therefore simply wrong.', 'The studies in detail We did not find any studies that investigated the effectiveness of the Tupler technique for the treatment of rectus diastase.']",1,"The claim that the Tupler technique is a scientifically proven therapy for rectus diastasis is incorrect, as no studies investigating its effectiveness for this condition were found.",We could not find a single study that examined whether the Tupler technique actually works. And this despite the fact that providers of the method advertise that its effectiveness is scientifically proven.
Can CBD (cannabidiol) help with migraines or other headaches?,"['Apparently, CBD has never been investigated to see if it can help with migraine seizures.', 'The claim that CBD would help with migraines or headaches is pure speculation.', 'The studies in detail Despite extensive search in three databases, we could not find any studies on CBD against migraine or other types of headache, neither for treatment nor for prevention.']",1,"While there are no studies found on CBD's effectiveness against migraines or other headaches, the claim of its helpfulness remains speculative.",There are no studies that have investigated the effectiveness of CBD against migraine. So claims that CBD can help with or prevent migraine attacks have no scientific basis. The same is true for other types of headache.
"In everyday life, when breathing with an FFP2 mask or ordinary mouth-nose protection, do you get as much oxygen as without a mask?","['As much oxygen as without a mask This fear is, however, unfounded, as previously conducted studies show [ 1,2 ].', 'Only in very strenuous sports (fast cycling to exhaustion) was the oxygen content in the blood with FFP2 mask slightly lower than without mask.', 'There was no difference in oxygen measurement with ordinary oral nose protection.', 'Breathing a little more strenuous The results thus contradict the rumor that masks would cause an oxygen deficiency.']",0,"The claim is supported by the sentences provided, as previous studies indicate no significant difference in oxygen intake when wearing an FFP2 mask or ordinary mouth-nose protection in everyday life, except for very strenuous sports with the FFP2 mask.","Even if breathing with a mask can feel uncomfortable: According to studies to date, you get just as much oxygen with an FFP2 mask or mouth-nose protection as without a mask. This is true even when you are moving or exerting yourself. Only very intensive sports slightly reduce the oxygen content in the blood - but too little to endanger health."
"Can a bioresonance device like ""Bioscan"" or ""Vieva Vital Analyser"" measure mineral and vitamin deficiencies or detect health problems?","['This experiment clearly shows that the devices studied are completely unsuitable to diagnose a lack of vitamins or minerals.', 'Sentenced for fraud at the end of May 2022, a German court also concluded that the Bioscan device cannot fulfil the claimed claims.', 'Claims for comparable products are equally implausible.', 'Even if 1000 subjects had participated in the study and only five to six people had shown such unreliable readings, such a device would be worthless for diagnostics.']",2,"The sentences provide evidence that Bioscan and similar devices cannot accurately measure mineral and vitamin deficiencies or detect health problems, as concluded by a German court and demonstrated in an experiment.","An experiment shows that the devices cannot distinguish between healthy people, seriously ill people and a corpse. The claimed mode of action behind the measurement method is also scientifically implausible. A German court has convicted the manufacturers of the Bioscan device (not legally binding) of fraud."
Does arthroscopy (joint endoscopy) help with osteoarthritis of the knee joint?,"['What might sound logical, however, has a catch: the arthroscopy of osteoarthritis does nothing to the treated person.', 'Studies clearly speak against a benefit A research team summarized the most meaningful of all previously published studies on arthroscopy in knee arthritis.', 'In these studies, patients treated after arthroscopy had no noticeably less pain or movement restrictions than those treated only for appearance or not at all.', 'Arthroscopy against osteoarthritis: not effective, but also not very risky After all: Undesirable events were not conspicuously common in the arthroscopy groups either.']",2,"The claim that arthroscopy helps with osteoarthritis of the knee joint is refuted by several studies indicating no significant reduction in pain or movement restrictions for patients who undergo the procedure, compared to those who receive no treatment or placebo treatment.",The data are clear: Arthroscopy is useless as a treatment for knee osteoarthritis. It can neither relieve pain nor improve the function of the knee joint in the long term.
"Do dietary supplements containing silicon (e.g. as ""organic silicon"" or silica) have health benefits?","['So far it is also completely unclear what role the element silicon plays in the human body at all [8].', 'We have researched: Previous studies do not provide any evidence that dietary supplements with silicon support bone build-up and thus protect older women from osteoporosis and bone fractures in old age [1,2].', 'There is no evidence that silicon improves the hair structure [3,4], strengthens the fingernails [4] or makes the skin more beautiful and elastic [4,6,7].', 'Also that silicon supports the formation of collagen and connective tissue is only a conjecture [8].', 'Conjectures without studies Neither we nor the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) [8] were able to find clinical studies on any other alleged health benefits of silicon.']",1,"The role of silicon in the human body is unclear, and no studies provide evidence that dietary supplements with silicon support bone build-up, improve hair structure, strengthen fingernails, make the skin more beautiful, or support collagen and connective tissue formation.","There is no evidence so far that the additional intake of silicon can promote health. Also that it strengthens nails, skin and hair is an unsubstantiated claim. Moreover, it is unclear whether silicon plays any role at all in the body."
Can regular intake of cranberry juice or cranberry extract prevent recurrent cystitis in women?,"['The summarized results show that the regular intake of cranberry products could have a preventive effect.', 'There is also only evidence that cranberry products can prevent bladder inflammation for otherwise healthy women.', 'Overall, there is evidence of a possible preventive effect of cranberry.']",0,"The summarized results indicate that cranberry products may prevent bladder inflammation for generally healthy women, but the evidence does not clearly support a preventive effect against recurrent cystitis in all women.","Women who repeatedly have to deal with bladder infections might become ill somewhat less frequently if they regularly take cranberry juice or extract. However, this is not well established. And it only applies to uncomplicated bladder infections in otherwise healthy women. Whether cranberry products help when cystitis is already present remains unclear. This has not yet been investigated in meaningful studies."
Will women who have recurrent bladder infections get rid of them faster if they take cranberry products only after the disease is already there???,"['There is also only evidence that cranberry products can prevent bladder inflammation for otherwise healthy women.', 'However, there does not seem to be any meaningful studies that have investigated this in women with recurrent bladder inflammation.', 'The preventive effect of cranberry in children, men and people with urinary catheters or certain diseases has not been studied.']",1,"The claim cannot be supported or refuted because there is no meaningful study that has investigated the effect of cranberry products on women with recurrent bladder infections, as stated in the sentences.","Women who repeatedly have to deal with bladder infections might become ill somewhat less frequently if they regularly take cranberry juice or extract.

Can extract from St. John's wort relieve the symptoms of depression? Is it similarly effective as drugs against depression (antidepressants)?,"[""St John's wort: effective in mild to moderate depression Probably yes."", ""In mild to moderate depression, St John's wort preparations probably work better than placebo."", ""St John's wort preparations are probably as good as antidepressants."", ""St. John's wort and antidepressants can relieve the discomfort, but the depression can probably not cure for good.""]",0,"The claim is supported by the sentences stating that St. John's wort is likely effective in mild to moderate depression, works better than a placebo, and is as good as antidepressants, although it may not cure depression permanently.",St. John's wort is likely to relieve the symptoms of mild to moderate depression better than a placebo. It also appears to be similarly effective to approved medications for depression (antidepressants). St. John's wort preparations are generally better tolerated than antidepressants.
Can ginkgo extract improve mental performance in dementia patients?,"['Dementia patients taking Ginkgo extract often seemed to perform better in thinking, memory, and concentration tasks than those who swallowed placebo preparations without an active substance [1.3].', 'Although the studies indicate that Ginkgo extract can help people with dementia, the significance of the individual studies is limited.']",0,"While some studies suggest Ginkgo extract may help dementia patients with thinking, memory, and concentration tasks, the significance of individual studies is limited.",Previous studies suggest that ginkgo extract can improve mental performance in dementia - but this is not well established. It is not possible to say exactly how large this effect is.
Does pine wood improve sleep?,"['So there is no indication that the pine wood improves sleep.', 'The importance of these laboratory measurements for the sleep of the participants is unclear – even if the researchers interpret them as positive effects of the circling bed.', 'Whether a pine bed actually improves sleep would have to study more rigorous studies carried out according to scientific criteria on significantly more subjects in the future.The studies in detail [1,2] Grote et al.']",1,"While some studies suggest positive effects of pine wood on sleep quality, the first sentence directly refutes the claim that pine wood improves sleep, stating there is no indication of such an effect.","So far, only one small study has investigated this question. However, the results of this study are not conclusive due to numerous deficiencies in the conduct of the study."
Do spermidine supplements or a spermidine-rich diet reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia? Do they help with existing dementia?,"['Spermidin studies: not enough as evidence of efficacy Even if both studies had come to overwhelmingly positive results, we would still have concerns about their significance.', 'Spermidine, which is additionally absorbed by food, is not sufficiently researched at the present time.', 'The number of participants is low and the risk is high that the results are not transferable to reality.', 'We do not consider the study to be meaningful.', 'Results: Both the spermidine group and the comparator group had fewer dementia symptoms and better mental performance at the end of the study.']",1,"The claim cannot be supported by the provided sentences, as the studies on spermidine's effects on dementia symptoms have low participant numbers and their results may not be representative of real-world scenarios, while spermidine's role in dementia risk reduction remains insufficiently researched.","Manufacturers of spermidine drugs advertise an alleged positive effect on mental performance and protection against dementia. However, such an effect has not been proven in meaningful studies. We found a single study in which dementia patients had participated. However, their results are not very clear."
Do green-lipped mussel preparations improve the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis?,"['For us, therefore, this claim is not credible.', 'Whether green-lipped mussel helps with rheumatism or not, can therefore not be said for sure at the moment.', 'Whether the results can be transferred to other products or other dosages is unclear.', ""The studies are all badly done according to today's standard: so it is unclear how reliable the measurements of the treatment success are."", 'Whether rheumatism patients would still benefit from green-lipped mussel preparations remains unclear.']",1,"While some studies exist, their quality is questionable, making it unclear if green-lipped mussel preparations alleviate rheumatoid arthritis symptoms or if results can be applied to different products or dosages.","Five small studies provide no overall evidence of benefit from green-lipped mussel in rheumatism. However, the rheumatism treatment of the participants does not meet today's standards and the studies were very poorly conducted. Therefore, we cannot draw any reliable conclusions from these studies."
Does covid vaccination reduce the likelihood of getting long-lasting symptoms (long covid) in case of corona infection?,"['Long-Covid risk with low vaccination Two studies [1,2] suggest that the long-covid risk is likely to be lower if vaccinated twice: In one of these studies with Corona infected [1], twice vaccinated patients reported 40 to 50 percent less likely to be affected by Long Covid compared to non-vaccinated patients.', 'Results Two-fold Vaccinated people reported to be affected by long-covid symptoms only about half as often as non-vaccinated people.']",0,"Twice vaccinated individuals report being affected by long-covid symptoms roughly half as often as non-vaccinated individuals, suggesting a lower risk of long-lasting symptoms with vaccination.","If twice-vaccinated people are infected, their risk of later being affected by Long Covid may be only half that of non-vaccinated people.

Can the preventive intake of lysine prevent cold sores (lip herpes) and genital herpes? Can lysine help when the blisters are already there?,"['You cannot answer whether preventively taken lysine can prevent herpes, or whether it helps if the blisters are already there.', ""So the lysine didn't seem to have any effect."", 'Does a higher dose of lysine work better than a lower dose?', 'Results Overall, the participants had no less frequent herpes, whether they were taking high-dose lysine, low-dose lysine or placebo.', 'Results The results are ambiguous and do not allow for certain conclusions: both the Lysin group and the placebo group were less likely to have lip herpes after 6 months.']",1,"The sentences provided offer no definitive evidence that preventively taken lysine can prevent herpes or help when blisters are already present, as some results are ambiguous and no significant difference was found between lysine doses or placebo.",Research is coming up with inconclusive and contradictory results. All available studies are small and of unclear quality. We could not say whether lysine protects against herpes or can alleviate it.
"Do hormonal contraceptives to swallow (the ""pill"") affect endurance performance in women?","['The conclusion of the work: Women taking the pill could actually have a minor disadvantage in sports.', 'Specifically, women with a pill may absorb less oxygen during training and are out of breath faster.', 'Possibly a slightly lower performance through the pill – to this conclusion also came another current overview work [2].']",0,Women taking hormonal contraceptives may experience a minor decrease in endurance performance due to reduced oxygen absorption during training and increased breathlessness.,"Taking the pill could possibly impair endurance performance in sports somewhat. However, there are no indications of less muscle strength due to the pill. However, these - somewhat contradictory - findings are anything but certain. Whether the somewhat reduced endurance performance speaks against contraception with the pill, each athlete must decide for herself - depending on how important top athletic performance is for her."
Does the pill affect the muscle strength of women??,"['Does the pill also affect muscle strength?', 'The available studies do not provide any indication of such an effect.']",2,The available studies do not suggest that the pill has any effect on women's muscle strength.,"Taking the pill could possibly impair endurance performance in sports somewhat.

Does whole-body cryotherapy in the cold chamber improve health?,"['Moreover, they cannot ensure that alleged improvements are really due to the cold chamber.', 'Based on these data, it is impossible to assess whether whole-body cooling therapy is effective and useful in different health problems.', 'However, none of the studies can prove the effectiveness of the cold chamber treatment, because everyone lacks meaningfulness.']",1,"The studies on whole-body cryotherapy do not provide sufficient evidence to determine its effectiveness in improving health, as they cannot ensure improvements are due to the cold chamber and lack meaningfulness.","Studies published so far are of low quality and therefore not conclusive. The effectiveness of the cold chamber has not been proven for either physical or psychological complaints. There is also no evidence of effectiveness in sports, for example for sore muscles or for a hoped-for increase in athletic performance."
Can low-level laser therapy reduce pain from knee or hip osteoarthritis?,"['According to the research team behind the review, the study situation for low-level laser therapy in knee arthrosis is not sufficient to confirm or exclude efficacy.', 'This was not the case, the laser treatment could not relieve the pain better than placebo treatment.']",1,"The research team's review of low-level laser therapy for knee osteoarthritis does not provide sufficient evidence to confirm or exclude its efficacy in pain relief, and a study found that it was no more effective than a placebo treatment.","In the pain treatment of wrist osteoarthritis, no efficacy can be assumed - this is indicated by the results of a small but well-done study.

Do sedatives and sleeping pills such as benzodiazepines and related substances increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease or other forms of dementia?,"['However, it cannot be clearly dispelled by the fact that benzodiazepines and similar substances could promote the development of dementia.']",1,"The sentence suggests a correlation between benzodiazepines and dementia, but it does not provide sufficient evidence to confirm a causative relationship between the two.","A link between the long-term use of sedatives and sleeping pills and the development of dementia cannot be ruled out. However, whether the drugs are the cause of dementia is unclear. Likewise, it is possible that studies show a connection only because people in the undiagnosed early stages of dementia suffer more frequently from sleep disorders or restlessness and therefore take medication against them more often."

This is due in particular to the fact that fewer perineal incisions were performed. The positive effect could not be shown for women who had already had a vaginal delivery.
Can cancer be effectively treated with vitamin C infusions?,"['Overall, the study shows that swallowing high doses of vitamin C probably does not help in cancer.', 'Instead, infusions are indicated – the aim is to achieve a higher concentration of vitamin in the blood and cancer tissue than is possible by swallowing vitamin C. However, the fact that higher levels of vitamin C blood can effectively combat cancer is mere theory.', 'It is therefore impossible to answer whether vitamin C infusions promote the healing of cancer.', 'However, it could not provide evidence of this, because important data are missing.', 'Overall, we conclude from the study that the intake of vitamin C in the form of preparations that are swallowed is probably ineffective for the treatment of cancer.']",1,"While the study suggests that high oral doses of vitamin C are likely ineffective for cancer treatment, it does not provide evidence for or against the effectiveness of vitamin C infusions due to missing data, thus not supporting the claim.",Studies conducted to date are deficient and inconclusive.
Are detox cures good for health?,"['We have not found any studies that demonstrate a health benefit of detox cures.', 'However, there is no scientific evidence that Detox can help here.']",1,"The claim that detox cures are beneficial for health is not supported by the provided sentences, which state that no studies have demonstrated a health benefit and there is no scientific evidence for Detox's effectiveness.","The term ""detox"" is not clearly defined.

Do sweeteners increase the risk of type 2 diabetes or sugar metabolism disorders?,"['Unfortunately, no clear statement In most of the studies we analysed, although there was a possible link between the consumption of sweeteners and an increased risk of diabetes.', 'Our conclusion is therefore that sweeteners increase the risk for type 2 diabetes, can neither be proven nor excluded on the basis of the current state of science.']",1,"The studies analyzed do not provide clear evidence for a link between sweetener consumption and an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, leaving the claim unproven.","The question has been investigated in several large population studies with long observation periods. Nevertheless, no clear conclusion can be drawn: the best estimates cautiously suggest a small effect. However, it could easily be due to other influences. Another problem is that most of the studies only examined sodas and other beverages containing sweeteners. Reliable information on quantity, sweetener type and foods containing sweeteners is lacking."
Can therapy with the radioactive gas radon noticeably alleviate pain in rheumatism-related joint inflammation (rheumatoid arthritis)?,"['A cure with radon does not seem to be able to relieve joint pain in rheumatism so well that the symptoms improve noticeably.', 'From this we conclude that a radon cure can probably not improve joint pain in rheumatism.']",2,The claim that radon therapy can alleviate pain in rheumatoid arthritis is not supported by the statements indicating a lack of significant symptom improvement and the conclusion that a radon cure probably cannot improve joint pain in rheumatism.,"In two small studies, a course of radon therapy relieved pain so slightly within six months that the effect was probably not noticeable."
Does yoga alleviate the severity of persistent back pain???,"['In contrast, if it may sound contradictory, the pain does not seem to improve noticeably.', 'Although the patients reported improvements in everyday life, on the other hand, there was no overall evidence that the pain improved [1,2].', 'The pain itself, however, does not seem to diminish noticeably through yoga.']",2,"The provided sentences offer conflicting views, but they primarily suggest that yoga does not lead to a noticeable decrease in the severity of persistent back pain, which contradicts the claim.","With yoga, after six months, sufferers are likely to feel somewhat less affected by their back pain and be able to ""function"" better in everyday life. However, it seems that the pain itself is not noticeably weakened by the yoga sessions."
Do laughter yoga or laughter therapy have positive health effects?,"['Therefore, we do not trust the results and there needs to be much better work on effects and side effects.', ""Contrary to the statements of the author's teams, we are by no means convinced that salmon therapy is helpful, for example, against depression, anxiety and stress or mental well-being, self-esteem, sleep and thinking ability.""]",1,"The claim's validity is not supported by the statements, as there is no trust in the results and a lack of strong evidence for positive health effects of laughter yoga or therapy on mental well-being, self-esteem, sleep, or thinking ability.","There are some studies on the subject.

However, the overall results should be interpreted with caution.",There is evidence that people with height-adjustable desks could reduce sitting by about 100 minutes per workday in the short term. Whether the effect lasts in the long term has not been studied. We have separately researched the extent to which a reduction in sitting time can contribute to better health.
Does a diet that includes as many organic foods as possible lower the risk of cancer?,"['Both studies can neither prove nor refute that organic foods protect against cancer.', 'Furthermore, the authors cannot rule out that there is another explanation for the lower risk of cancer in the French study: for example, it could also be that the proponents of bio-foods have reduced the likelihood of cancer for quite different reasons, for example through factors such as income, education or access to the health system.', 'Overall, it remains questionable whether a diet with a high proportion of organic food can reduce the risk of cancer.', 'Therefore, it remains unclear whether the slightly lower number of cancer cases in the French study was really due to the diet with more organic food.', 'Conclusion Overall, all data can neither prove nor refute the established thesis.']",1,"While some studies suggest a lower risk of cancer among those consuming organic food, it cannot be definitively concluded that this is due to the organic diet, as other factors such as income, education, or healthcare access may also contribute, and the studies do not prove or refute the protective effect of organic food against cancer.","To date, only two studies have been published that have explored a possible link between the consumption of organic products and cancer risk. Both publications have methodological flaws. Moreover, they contradict each other: One suggests that people with higher organic consumption are less likely to develop cancer, while the second study found no differences between organic and conventional diets."
Does cinnamon lower blood sugar levels in diabetes?,"['Their summarized results are disappointing: Cinnamon can probably not influence, therefore, the blood sugar level of diabetes sufferers in a favorable way.', 'Overall, blood glucose levels did not differ between the two groups at the end of the study.', 'A longer-term effect of cinnamon – for example, on health consequences of diabetes – has not yet been investigated.']",2,The summarized results from multiple studies indicate that cinnamon does not have a significant impact on lowering blood sugar levels in individuals with diabetes.,The pooled results of studies to date indicate that cinnamon is unlikely to affect blood glucose levels in diabetic patients.
Does sitting for long periods shorten the lifespan?,"['The summarized results of these studies seem to confirm the fears: the people studied lived shorter when they spent a lot of time sitting [1,2].', 'According to this study, in an average period of about eight years, 7 out of 100 people who had spent less than 9 hours a day sitting died 10 out of 100 people who had spent 10 hours a day sitting.', 'However, the studies have one thing in common with both types of survey: they suggest that the more time you spend sitting each day, the more likely you will be to die early.', 'Thus, long sitting, regardless of age, overweight, smoking or alcohol consumption, seems to shorten your life.']",0,"Long periods of sitting increase the likelihood of early death, as shown in studies where participants who sat for longer periods had higher mortality rates.","According to the summarized results of previous studies, people live shorter if they sit for nine hours or per day. However, it is not well established that sitting for long periods is really to blame for premature deaths."
Does mammography screening reduce the risk of dying from breast cancer in certain age groups?,"['Participation in mammography screening is likely to reduce the risk of dying from breast cancer in women at an average risk.', 'For women aged 50 and over, participation in mammography screening reduced the risk of more advanced breast cancer, but not for younger women.']",0,"The claim is partially supported as mammography screening reduces the risk of dying from breast cancer in women aged 50 and over by decreasing the risk of more advanced breast cancer, but it does not affect younger women's risk.","According to a large systematic review, participation in mammography screening in women between 50 and 69 is likely to prevent a few deaths from breast cancer. Whether mammography screening reduces breast cancer mortality in women younger than 50 years has not been proven with certainty."
"Should wisdom teeth that have not or not completely grown out of the jaw and gums be removed as a precaution? Even if the ""impacted"" teeth are not causing any symptoms at the moment and no pathological changes are to be expected immediately?","['Because these partly have serious defects, it remains unclear whether caries, inflammations (parodontitis) and misalignments of other teeth can be influenced by the precautionary removal of wisdom teeth.', 'Overall, therefore, the study situation is insufficient and dental research can so far give no answer to whether symptom-free retinated wisdom teeth should be removed or left in the mouth.', 'Therefore, we do not know whether it makes sense to remove non-complaint-free retinated wisdom teeth in the sense of precaution by means of routine surgery, in order to avoid later problems for example with caries or misalignments.']",1,"While there is no clear scientific consensus on the benefits of removing asymptomatic, impacted wisdom teeth to prevent issues like caries, inflammations, or misalignments, some studies indicate that these complications might be influenced by their removal.","According to current knowledge, there is no answer as to whether the precautionary removal of impacted wisdom teeth helps to prevent problems later in life. It is therefore unclear how to deal with these last molars if they do not protrude or only partially protrude from the jaw and gums, are free of signs of disease and do not damage neighboring teeth."
Does taking vitamin A or following certain diets improve or halt the progression of multiple sclerosis (MS)?,"[""So we can't say whether the use of vitamin A or the diets mentioned above is effective to influence MS favorably.""]",1,The sentence does not provide evidence supporting the use of vitamin A or specific diets as a means to influence the progression of multiple sclerosis.,"Studies with a total of over 1000 participants found predominantly no benefit from omega-3 fatty acids.

Are privately performed IgG tests to clarify food intolerances meaningful?,"['However, the risk of shortages Experts, especially of allergology, warn against such tests: They point out that so far there has been no clear evidence of food intolerances caused by IgG.', 'Basic problems All studies have a fundamental problem: the patients in the treatment and control group ate different foods.', 'This does not make it clear whether a possible improvement of the complaints is actually due to IgG testing or rather to the choice of food.', 'A benefit of the IgG tests can therefore also not be conclusively demonstrated by the studies in persons with intestinal diseases.', 'Since the study lasted only four weeks, it is not possible to draw conclusions about longer-term results.']",1,"The studies on IgG tests for food intolerances are inconclusive due to factors such as different diets in the treatment and control groups, making it unclear whether any improvement in symptoms is a result of the testing or the food choices.",Whether elevated levels of immunoglobulin G in the blood are actually signs of intolerance to certain foods is highly controversial. Studies in which people with intestinal diseases avoid specific foods provide no clear evidence of benefit.
Is a gluten-free diet recommended for people who do not have celiac disease?,"['Whether gluten itself does not actually cause digestive problems, if one does not suffer from celiac disease, has to be examined better in larger studies.', 'Hardly surprising, there are no solid long-term studies on healthy individuals on the risks of a gluten-free diet.', 'Currently, there are no convincing studies that argue for the absence of gluten by healthy people.', 'So we currently do not know whether a gluten-free diet has long-term advantages.', 'Overall, the studies conducted so far on gluten-free nutrition in people without celiac disease are not meaningful.']",1,"While there is no solid evidence indicating that a gluten-free diet has long-term advantages for those without celiac disease, there is also a lack of studies examining the potential risks of such a diet in healthy individuals.","There are no well-done studies that have investigated gluten abstinence in people who do not suffer from the autoimmune disease celiac disease. Therefore, there is a lack of reliable data on the possible benefits of a long-term gluten-free diet in the general population. Equally poorly studied are any risks of this form of renunciation, which is so hip at the moment."
Does the plant substance nobiletin contained in mandarins protect against weight gain?,"['Mandarin active substance for overweight laboratory mice No, most likely not: Nobiletin occurs mainly in the shell of mandarins.', '...but no studies in humans The results of this animal study are not easily transferable to humans.', 'Therefore, no evidence of the efficacy of the mandarin active substance can be made for humans until results have been obtained.', 'Whether the study participants have also lost weight has not been investigated.', 'The claim that mandarins can protect against obesity is not scientifically valid at the moment.']",1,"The claim that nobiletin in mandarins protects against weight gain is not scientifically validated, as studies showing this effect are mainly in animals and do not involve human subjects.","In genetically modified laboratory mice, the additional administration of nobiletin to a high-fat and high-sugar diet appears to be able to prevent obesity. Such an effect has not yet been studied in humans."
Do protein supplements help build muscle?,"['Methodical Deficiencies Scratch in Significance However, the significance of the summarized study results is limited because only a few subjects had participated in the individual studies.', 'The results also do not allow conclusions to be drawn on the effect of protein powders, drinks and bars.', 'It is therefore unclear whether it must be the expensive protein powder or whether it is enough to eat more milk, yoghurt and co.', 'According to the summarized results of previously published studies, however, it does not seem to matter whether older people take protein supplements in addition to muscle building training.', 'Our question about the effectiveness of protein powders, beverages and bars cannot be answered for another reason.']",1,"While some studies suggest that protein supplements may not significantly impact muscle building in older individuals with training, it remains unclear if protein powders, drinks, or bars are more effective than consuming more milk, yogurt, and similar foods.","A lot of research is being done in the field.

Can regular consumption of chocolate prevent cardiovascular disease?,"['An analysis of long-term studies investigating the relationship between chocolate consumption and cardiovascular disease indicates a significantly reduced risk.', 'In a period of eight to 16 years, regular chocolate consumption decreased the likelihood of developing a heart attack, stroke or related disease by about a third [1].', 'An overview of the results of individual studies to date showed a positive influence of flavonoid-rich chocolate and cocoa products on the blood pressure of study participants.', 'Long-term effect unclear Short-term studies over a few weeks, which only examined the effect of chocolate, provide evidence that chocolate could at least temporarily lower too high blood pressure and cholesterol levels, albeit only to a very small extent.']",0,"The analysis of long-term studies and individual overviews indicates a potential for regular chocolate consumption to decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease, particularly heart attacks and strokes, due to flavonoid-rich chocolate and cocoa products' positive influence on blood pressure, but the long-term effect remains unclear based on short-term studies.","It is possible, but by no means certain, that chocolate could reduce the risk of developing cardiovascular disease such as heart attack or stroke. However, the high proportion of sugar and fat in most types of chocolate could also have negative effects."
Are diets with reduced carbohydrate content better for weight loss than other weight loss programs?,"['However, there is no evidence that they work better than fat-reduced diets or programs that put on a balanced nutrient combination [1-4].', 'Therefore, it cannot be completely ruled out that individual studies have shown the effects of low-carb diets a little more positive than they actually were.', 'In summary, the four overviews show very similar results: Low-carb diets are comparable to other diets, but more weight than with conventional weight loss programs can probably not be lost in the long term.']",2,"The four overviews indicate that low-carb diets result in similar weight loss as other diets, and while some individual studies may have shown more positive results, there is no substantial evidence supporting that reduced carbohydrate diets lead to more weight loss than fat-reduced or balanced nutrient diets in the long term.","There is much evidence to suggest that, in the case of obesity, low-carbohydrate diets lead to at least comparable weight loss over one to two years as fat-reduced diets or weight-loss programs with a balanced diet."
Does taking probiotics during pregnancy and early life protect children from atopic dermatitis?,"['Protection in and after pregnancy The summarized results of previous studies show that probiotics may protect infants from neurodermatitis [1].', 'A recent study summary confirms previous results: For children whose mothers had taken several mixed probiotic strains, the preventive effect was even greater [4].', 'The fact that probiotics may have a preventive effect against the development of atopic eczema shows a meta-anlysis from 2012 [1].', 'According to the analysis, probiotics could reduce the risk of neurodermatitis by one fifth.']",0,"The claim is supported by a meta-analysis from 2012 and a recent study, suggesting that probiotics may protect infants from atopic dermatitis and could reduce the risk by one fifth when taken during pregnancy and early life.","Current studies suggest that the intake of probiotics could counteract the development of atopic dermatitis. However, many questions about efficacy and intake remain unanswered."
Is Bulletproof Coffee recommended?,"['Conclusion Published studies with human subjects who have dealt with the subject of Bulletproof Coffee are not available.', 'It also lacks the basis to make statements about side effects and long-term safety of this food form.', 'Thus it should not be quite easy to make various effects dingfest.', 'Ingredients under the microscope We have not found any clinical studies on the effects of Bulletproof Coffee.', 'However, there are still various unexplained aspects around these references.']",1,"The claim that Bulletproof Coffee is recommended cannot be supported since there are no published human studies evaluating its effects or long-term safety, and no clinical studies on its ingredients' effects have been found.","Bulletproof coffee is high in caffeine and fat.

Because there have been no studies on this coffee blend with human test subjects, we cannot make any reliable statements."
Do apples help with smoking cessation?,"['However, it is open which ingredients of apples should take the pleasure of tormenting – scientific evidence for this claim is missing.', 'However, apples do not appear in this context and in evidence-based recommendations [a], at least not as an aid.', 'However, the effects are small, and whether the apple taste is responsible can only be speculated.', 'On the other hand, it is not researched whether the apple really takes the appetite for the cigarette.']",1,"The sentences provide no substantial evidence supporting the claim that apples help with smoking cessation, as they mention a lack of scientific support, absence in evidence-based recommendations, and unclear connection between apple taste and reduced cigarette cravings.",Apples contain numerous ingredients and rightly have the reputation of being a healthy snack. Whether they can help to give up cigarettes has not yet been investigated in studies.
Do products made from fenugreek seeds help you lose weight?,"['However, the results do not indicate that an extract of plant seeds could help to reduce weight.', 'It is therefore unclear whether fenugreek seeds are able to lower blood sugar both in the short term and over longer periods of time.', 'Therefore, it remains unclear to what extent fenugreek seeds can be helpful in weight loss.', 'Whether the Fenulife product helps with weight loss can by no means be demonstrated by a study carried out for only three days.', 'The result is sobering: no meaningful studies of high quality were found.']",1,"The sentences provide no evidence supporting the claim that fenugreek seeds help with weight loss, as they indicate a lack of high-quality studies and unclear effects on blood sugar and weight reduction.","We found only one study in which participants had not lost weight after six weeks. However, the study period is very short, the number of participants small and the quality mediocre. It therefore remains unclear whether fenugreek seeds can help lose weight in the longer term."
Does skipping breakfast increase heart attack risk?,"['Obviously, therefore, the main reason for the increased risk of heart attacks was not to skip the morning meal, but overweight, diabetes, increased blood pressure, or too high cholesterol levels.', 'Thus, it is unclear whether the omission of breakfast leads to overweight or excess weight leads to the omission of breakfast.']",1,"The claim that skipping breakfast increases heart attack risk is not directly supported by the sentences, as they suggest that other factors like overweight, diabetes, increased blood pressure, or high cholesterol levels are the main reasons for the increased risk.","There is no clear evidence that not eating breakfast could be a cause of obesity and, as a consequence, an increased risk of heart attack. It is possible, however, that it is primarily those people who are overweight and have a higher heart risk who forgo their morning meal."
Does wheat make you fat and sick?,"['But even if all of these mechanisms were correctly described, this does not necessarily mean that wheat makes you sick – the interplay of all mechanisms is not known.', 'Thus, the reduction of excess weight leads to health improvements, not the elimination of wheat.']",1,"While the claim suggests a connection between wheat and health issues, the sentences provided do not support this claim directly, instead emphasizing the role of excess weight in health improvements and the lack of understanding about the interplay of all mechanisms.",There is no evidence in current studies that wheat has a special connection with obesity and its consequences. Attributing a special role to wheat seems implausible.
Do whole grains lower the likelihood of dying early?,"['Against cancer, heart problems and diabetes The current study situation shows something else: Those who frequently resort to whole grains get less cancer or cardiovascular diseases, for example a heart attack [1–4].', 'Thus, people in whom whole grains play a major role in their daily diet seem to live longer and healthier.', 'All four summaries come to the same conclusion: They show a clear correlation between a full-grain diet and a reduced chance of dying early.', 'At least as far as the reduced risk of disease is concerned, the data show a robust dose-effect relationship: the more whole grains are eaten, the lower the risk of disease [6].']",0,"The sentences provide evidence that a diet rich in whole grains is associated with a reduced risk of disease and a potential increase in lifespan, but they do not directly address the likelihood of dying early.",People who eat whole grain products instead of foods made from refined flour are likely to live longer and probably have a lower risk of dying from cancer or cardiovascular disease.
"Does the consumption of dairy products promote mucus and diseases of the ear, nose and throat?","['No correlation between milk consumption and laboratory values The results of studies published so far in a systematic review do not indicate that high milk consumption increases inflammation levels in the blood.', ""However, the fact that the long-standing popular belief that cow's milk has a smearing effect is not likely to be confirmed by this, according to current knowledge.""]",1,"The claim that dairy consumption promotes mucus and diseases of the ear, nose, and throat is not supported by the findings of a systematic review indicating no correlation between milk consumption and increased inflammation levels in the blood, nor is it confirmed by the lack of evidence for cow's milk having a smearing effect.",There is no scientific evidence to prove that cow's milk causes mucus.
Does regular consumption of energy drinks harm heart health?,"['Thus, energy drinks could potentially increase heart rate and blood pressure in the short term, but this is not the case in all studies.', 'However, the fact that the energy drinks had caused death is not certain.', 'There is no evidence that caffeine can cause cardiac arrhythmias or atrial fibrillation at moderate doses.', 'Larger doses of energy drinks can cause, for example, heart turf, tremor, arousal and digestive problems.']",1,"While some studies suggest energy drinks may transiently increase heart rate and blood pressure, there is insufficient evidence to confirm they cause harm to heart health, and caffeine at moderate doses does not lead to cardiac arrhythmias or atrial fibrillation.",This question is insufficiently researched. Larger studies over a longer period of time are needed to assess the heart risk from energy drinks.
Does sugar consumption increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes regardless of obesity?,"['Soft drinks increase the risk of diabetes People with a preference for large amounts of sugar-containing sodas also suffer more frequently from diabetes.', 'In their analyses, two research teams [1,2] were able to independently show that the more sugar the study participants consume in the form of soft drinks, the higher the probability of developing type 2 diabetes.', 'It seems that daily consumption of sugared soft drinks can trigger diabetes over many years even if it does not make you fat.', 'Sugar content of other foods with unclear influence The association with type 2 diabetes is relatively clear for soft drinks.']",0,"The sentences provide evidence that soft drink sugar consumption increases type 2 diabetes risk, regardless of obesity, as higher soft drink sugar intake is associated with a higher probability of diabetes.","Sugar-containing soft drinks can - if consumed regularly - cause obesity. Obesity, in turn, increases the likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes. However, sugared soft drinks probably also increase the risk of diabetes independently of obesity."
Does a lower salt diet reduce the likelihood of cardiovascular disease?,"['Whether the many salt in the food was really the reason for cardiovascular diseases, however, cannot be unquestionably clarified.', 'The result: a low-salt diet seems to be able to actually reduce the likelihood of cardiovascular diseases.', 'Those who reduce their salt consumption can reduce blood pressure in the medium term.', 'Lowering the risk of consequential diseases caused by high blood pressure can help a diet that is poorer in salt.']",0,"While the relationship between salt and cardiovascular diseases is not definitively established, a low-salt diet has been found to reduce blood pressure and the risk of subsequent diseases caused by high blood pressure.","A lower-salt diet has been shown to help reduce elevated blood pressure somewhat. It is possible, but not certain, that this reduces the likelihood of dying from a stroke or the consequences of narrowed heart vessels, such as a heart attack."
Is less eaten from red plates?,"['The result: The test subjects who were served their pretzels on red plates accessed significantly less than participants with blue or white plates.', 'In a second experiment, subjects also drank soft drinks in a larger amount of blue instead of red cups.', 'As logical as this explanation may sound, the study does not yet provide scientific evidence that red plates really eat less.', 'In both salty and sweet snacks, the participants gained less when they were lying on a red plate in front of them.']",0,"The study's findings indicate that test subjects consumed fewer salty and sweet snacks from red plates compared to blue or white plates, but the evidence does not conclusively prove that red plates cause a reduction in food consumption.","In two psychological experiments, participants were less likely to eat salty pretzels, popcorn or chocolate chips if they were served on red plates. It is unclear whether the effect lasts over a longer period of time."
Does red wine protect better against cardiovascular disease than white wine?,"['However, they usually did not distinguish between white and red wine [1] [2] [3].', 'It can therefore not be proven that red wine protects particularly well against cardiovascular diseases.', 'Thus, people who consume small amounts of alcohol daily seem to have a lower cardiovascular risk and live a little longer than strict non-drinkers [1] [2] [3] [4].', 'The result: For a moderate dose of eight to ten grams of pure alcohol per day, the overall mortality and risk of cardiovascular disease were lower than for non- or minor drinkers.', 'The impact of the studies is limited Even if people who eat a glass of wine or beer daily live longer and healthier, this does not necessarily mean that alcoholic beverages are responsible.']",1,"The claim that red wine protects better against cardiovascular disease than white wine cannot be proven by the provided sentences, as most studies do not distinguish between the two types of wine and moderate alcohol consumption, regardless of type, seems to lower cardiovascular risk.","There is evidence that moderate amounts of alcohol may protect against cardiovascular disease, but the effect is not well established. Whether this possibly protective effect is stronger with red wine than with white wine or other alcoholic beverages has not been sufficiently investigated."
Do azo food dyes cause attention deficit disorder and hyperactivity in children?,"['Since 2010, the EU has committed manufacturers to label food with azo dyes ""May affect the activity and attention of children"".', 'However, the summarized results of these and other previously published studies provide clear evidence that artificial food colours can cause attention and hyperactivity disorder (ADHS).', 'Although the bright-colored dyes could be a partial cause of ADHD, there are certainly many other unknown triggers [5].', 'The studies in detail The fact that azo dyes could be responsible for behavioural abnormalities of children suggests a clean summary of previous studies [2].', 'Compared to children who continued to consume azo dyes, behavioural abnormalities decreased slightly.']",0,"The EU's requirement for azo dye labeling indicating potential effects on children's activity and attention, along with studies suggesting a link between azo dyes and ADHD, implies a possible connection; however, the evidence is not definitive and other factors may contribute to ADHD.",Some studies fuel the suspicion that azo dyes can exacerbate ADHD symptoms.
Does turmeric prevent or cure cancer?,"['However, well-executed studies of this kind have so far been scarce.', 'After 6 months of administration, the values did not differ between turmeric and dummy subjects.', 'This makes it unclear whether any improvement observed is due to turmeric treatment or whether the health status of the study participants would have improved without turmeric.']",1,"The claim that turmeric prevents or cures cancer is not supported by the provided sentences, as there is a lack of clear evidence showing an improvement in health status due to turmeric treatment compared to no treatment.",Animal studies provide tentative evidence that turmeric can prevent or treat cancer. Whether turmeric has such an effect in humans cannot be assessed due to the low confidence level of a few studies conducted to date.
Does breastfeeding reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome?,"['The scientists conclude that the risk of breastfed children is halved compared to un breastfed children [2].', 'However, the matter has a small catch: the studies analysed show a connection.', 'The studies in detail The fact that breastfeeding reduces the risk of unexpected death of a baby is only moderately secure.', 'However, this does not necessarily prove that breastfeeding is the reason for the lower risk of infant death.']",0,"While studies suggest a connection between breastfeeding and a lower risk of sudden infant death syndrome, they do not definitively prove that breastfeeding is the cause of this reduced risk.","Breastfeeding can possibly reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome, but this is not entirely certain.

Can the consumption of caffeine during pregnancy harm the unborn child?,"['However, the study showed that it made no difference whether the participants drank around three cups of caffeine or decaffeinated coffee.', ""On average, the weight of birth at birth was about the same, was similar in size and was not more frequently born too early even after the mother's caffeine consumption."", 'Similar to the summary of the Cochrane overview work: In early pregnancy three cups of coffee daily would have no effect on birth weight, growth or premature birth [2].']",1,"The study's findings indicate that caffeine consumption during pregnancy, equivalent to around three cups of coffee, does not negatively impact birth weight, size, or gestational age at birth.",There is insufficient evidence that moderate consumption of caffeinated beverages would have a negative impact on the child's development. Up to three cups of coffee a day does not appear to reduce the child's birth weight. Very large amounts of caffeine-containing beverages could possibly contribute to lower birth weight.
Can garlic extract reduce high blood pressure and thus the risk of cardiovascular disease?,"['Two better performed randomised-controlled studies provide cautious evidence that garlic can lower too high blood pressure [1].', 'However, even the results of these two studies are insufficiently valid for a clear assessment [1].', 'Whether garlic taken regularly can lower too high blood pressure and thus lower the risk of cardiovascular disease remains unclear for the time being.', 'At least in theory, there may also be interactions with anticoagulant drugs or side effects in persons with a tendency to bleed, as garlic is suspected to have an anticoagulant effect.']",1,"While two studies suggest garlic can lower high blood pressure, their validity is questioned, leaving it unclear if garlic can reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and potential interactions with anticoagulant drugs or side effects in individuals prone to bleeding.","Studies to date provide tentative evidence of a blood pressure-lowering effect of garlic.

Can green tea reduce the likelihood of dying from cancer ?,"['In some studies, there was indeed a slightly reduced probability of disease, but other studies even suggested an increased risk of cancer from the use of green tea.', 'The result provides sobering clarity: people who regularly drink large amounts of green tea die in sum as often at some kind of cancer as people who hardly touch green tea [8].', 'To a degree harmless Although the benefits of green tea against cancer are questionable, there is no evidence of a health-impairing effect in moderate consumption of some cups a day [2].']",2,"While some studies suggest a slight reduction in disease probability with green tea consumption, others indicate an increased cancer risk, and overall, regular drinkers of large amounts of green tea die from cancer at similar rates as those who rarely drink it, providing no clear evidence of reduced likelihood of dying from cancer due to green tea consumption.",The results of previous studies suggest that green tea cannot reduce the risk of dying from cancer.
Is the sweetener aspartame harmful to health?,"['The result: the sweetener is in all probability safe.', 'Safety levels Based on the results of numerous studies in laboratory animals and humans, the scientists established a safety limit for aspartame.', 'Thus, every person can take 40 milligrams per kilogram of body weight every day for the rest of his life without fear of health consequences.', 'Even those who exceed this amount will not suffer any health hazard.']",2,"Based on numerous studies in laboratory animals and humans, scientists have established a safety limit for aspartame, indicating that it is unlikely to be harmful to health when consumed within the recommended daily limit.","Health damage from aspartame is unlikely. This also applies to people who consume aspartame-sweetened foods and beverages in large quantities over a long period of time. However, in people suffering from the hereditary disease phenylketonuria (PKU), aspartame can cause nerve and brain damage."
Does coffee affect cancer death risk?,"['Both studies concluded that coffee consumption has no effect on cancer mortality.', 'In other words, coffee generally does not seem to favor or prevent death through cancer.', 'For breast cancer, prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer and bladder cancer there seems to be no association with the consumption of coffee.', 'Conclusion: Coffee consumption does not seem to affect cancer mortality.', 'They did not detect any influence of coffee on the number of cancer deaths.']",2,"The studies consistently show no association between coffee consumption and a reduced or increased risk of cancer mortality, including specific types such as breast, prostate, pancreatic, and bladder cancer.",Current evidence suggests that coffee consumption in general is neither protective nor detrimental to cancer death risk.

It is unclear whether animal milk increases the risk of type 1 diabetes or blood in the stool, or reduces the likelihood of allergic diseases."
Does drinking breast milk as a baby have a positive effect on later health and development?,"['In any case, it is proven that this form of nutrition has certain health benefits – such as a lower risk for some infectious diseases in infanthood [2] [4] [9] and the sudden death of children, as we have reported here.', 'In later life, the risk of obesity is somewhat reduced [5.6],the IQ of breastfeeding children seems to be a few points higher [7].', 'In summary, the authors believe that drinking breast milk does not produce any practical benefits.', 'For example, breastfeeding may help reduce the risk of certain forms of cancer in children [4] [8,9].']",0,"While some studies suggest health benefits such as reduced risk of infectious diseases, obesity, and certain forms of cancer in children, as well as a potential increase in IQ, the authors believe that drinking breast milk does not provide any practical benefits.","It is possible that children who have been exclusively breastfed for a long time are somewhat less likely to become overweight later on. There is also evidence that their IQ is slightly higher. However, it is difficult to isolate the influence of breast milk drinking. Therefore, it is questionable what significance the effects found have in practice."

Does the Aspire system help you lose weight?,"['Whether this system leads to the desired weight loss, however, can not be said for sure at the present time.', 'However, it points to a strong effect: the study participants with the Aspire system lost an average of 21 kilograms in the first year, the comparison group only about 6 kilograms [1].', 'Patients with Aspire decreased an average of 21 kilograms in the first year, compared with about 6 kilograms in the comparative group.']",0,"The first sentence in the provided context states that the Aspire system's impact on weight loss cannot be definitively claimed at the moment, which contradicts the claim; however, the second and third sentences indicate that study participants with the Aspire system lost an average of 21 kilograms in the first year, compared to only 6 kilograms in the control group, suggesting a significant difference in weight loss.","Although there is only one small study on this, it shows a very large effect - which indicates that it is effective."
Can FLEXISEQ ointment relieve osteoarthritis pain?,"[""So the ointment FLEXISEQ would have to be compared to a placebo ointment – that hasn't happened yet; compared to a medication to be swallowed, a placebo to be swallowed, and an ointment with an active substance, but its effectiveness itself is not too clear."", 'So it is not sure whether the ointment helps better than a suitable placebo.', 'The study duration in the four individual studies described is a maximum of 12 weeks, so long-term effects have not yet been investigated.']",1,"While there have been studies on FLEXISEQ ointment, they do not clearly demonstrate its superiority over a suitable placebo in relieving osteoarthritis pain, and long-term effects remain unexplored.",Comparisons to date with other commonly used treatments are difficult to interpret but do not yield clear evidence of efficacy.
Can butterbur prevent migraine attacks?,"['In summary, both studies show that it is twice as likely that the number of migraine attacks will halve after twelve weeks with the Pestwurz preparation compared to a dummy medication.', 'The above overviews are of different quality, but all come to the same conclusions due to the two same studies: Pestwurz can reduce the number of migraine attacks for some patients.']",0,"The two studies, though of varying quality, consistently conclude that butterbur, or Pestwurz, can reduce the frequency of migraine attacks for some patients.","Two well-done randomized-controlled trials show efficacy - the number of migraine attacks can probably be reduced with butterbur. Even if the effect is not huge, taking it may be worthwhile due to only minor side effects."
Can maggots accelerate the healing of chronic wounds compared to conventional treatment?,"['Although the thorough cleansing of the wound is important for the healing process [2], there seems to be no indication that wounds heal faster after the maggot treatment [1].', 'Twelve months after the start of treatment, the number of subjects with healed chronic wounds in the maggot group was no greater than in patients with hydrogel associations.']",2,"The sentences provide evidence that the claim is not supported, as there is no indication of faster healing in chronic wounds treated with maggots compared to hydrogel associations.","Maggot therapy may not heal chronic wounds any faster than conventional wound care. However, the maggots seem to be able to clean the wound of dead tissue more quickly - but also cause more pain."
Do electric toothbrushes protect oral health better than manual brushes?,"['After a thorough analysis of all the results, they have come to a clear conclusion: Yes, electric toothbrushes are actually better for oral hygiene – but the difference is not large [1].', 'The electric oral cleaning thus removes a trace better than hand toothbrushes.', 'If you brush your teeth electrically, you will also get a little less gingival inflammation than people who brush manually, according to the results of the analyzed studies.', 'The advantage of electric toothbrushes compared to conventional toothbrushes is small.']",0,"The analysis of several studies indicates that electric toothbrushes provide slightly better oral hygiene and less gingival inflammation compared to manual brushes, but the difference is not substantial.",Electric toothbrushes probably combat plaque and bleeding gums slightly better than conventional manual toothbrushes.

Do antidepressants from the group of serotonin reuptake inhibitors help with depression?,"['Even if not all questions have been finally clarified around the SSRI group, the current study situation has revealed the following: SSRIs are effective.', ""SSRIs are not ‘happy pills', the effects achieved are rather moderate."", 'SSRI can be helpful in severe and probably also moderate depression.', 'In fact, the study situation with SSRI, as measured by its wide spread, was rather modest over a long period of time.']",0,"The current study situation shows that SSRIs are effective in treating depression, although their effects are moderate and they may be more helpful in severe and moderate depression, which contrasts with the notion of them being ""happy pills.""","Serotonin reuptake inhibitors have been shown to be helpful in more severe depression, although the exact mechanisms are not clear. Overall, very strong or rapid effects are not expected. For milder depression, efficacy is more debatable. Sometimes patients have to try several SSRI preparations until they feel an improvement in symptoms, and some sufferers are not helped by the drugs at all. Well-done studies should help clarify the situation in the future so that more targeted treatment is possible."
Is there a health risk from metal contaminants in lipsticks?,"['Risk in individual cases unclear The cited study by the team led by study leader Liu [1] analysed 32 products on their metal content.', 'The small amounts of lipstick thus do not lead to an increased risk of poisoning.', 'If the use of lipsticks is therefore a health risk when used very frequently, only more detailed and extensive studies can show.']",1,"While the study analyzed 32 lipstick products for metal content, it does not provide clear evidence of a health risk from metal contaminants in lipsticks, especially given the small amounts and unclear risk in individual cases.","Several chemical analyses find traces of metals in lipsticks, which can in principle be harmful in high concentrations. However, the analyses do not examine the quantities in which the metals are actually absorbed and whether they cause damage in the body. Overall, there is still too little research into whether there could be a risk for some of the metal impurities if they are used very frequently."
Can topiramate reduce the frequency of migraine attacks?,"['The authors summarized the results of 17 studies and found that the number of headaches actually decreases – but only by one in 28 days.', '[1] The overview also shows positive effects on the overall quality of life, but only to a small extent and not quite without contradiction.', 'Although all studies go in the same direction and indicate the effectiveness of topiramate, despite the review work of Cochrane Collaboration, the evidence is low, also because there are other criticisms: The authors have several conflicts of interest and it is possible that studies with poor results have not been published (publication bias).', 'Little knowledge about chronic migraine In the expert recommendation on therapy and care for chronic migraine, two small studies are mentioned, according to which topiramate can also prevent in chronic migraine attacks [2].']",0,"The claim is partially supported by the first sentence indicating a decrease in headaches, but the overall evidence is low due to conflicts of interest, potential publication bias, and small study size, as mentioned in the third sentence.","Possibly yes. A review by the Cochrane Collaboration attests that topiramate slightly reduces the frequency of migraine attacks in adults, and in some patients the attacks even decrease significantly. Still, there are unanswered questions and the side effects should not be underestimated."
"Can a dietary supplement containing omega-3 fatty acids, lipids, vitamins, and nutrients (""Souvenaid"") noticeably slow or halt the decline of mental performance in Alzheimer's disease?","['A comparison of the test values of the product and placebo groups with the end of the study shows no noticeable difference in the memory performance of the participants.', ""Two randomised-controlled studies for six to twelve months [4] and a third randomised-controlled study for 18 months [5] show that omega-3 fat-containing fish oil capsules cannot improve mental capacity in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease."", ""Whether one can prevent or delay the outbreak of Alzheimer's disease, if one regularly eats fish oil capsules, is not sufficiently investigated [6]."", ""Those who swallow preparations containing vitamin B6, B12 and folic acid should not be able to prevent mild to mild Alzheimer's disease from progressing [6].""]",2,"The studies provide no evidence that Souvenaid, a dietary supplement containing omega-3 fatty acids, lipids, vitamins, and nutrients, can slow or halt the decline of mental performance in Alzheimer's disease, as there is no significant difference in memory performance between the product and placebo groups, and omega-3 fat-containing fish oil capsules have not shown improvement in mental capacity in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, vitamin B6, B12, and folic acid preparations do not prevent the progression of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.",Three randomized-controlled trials show that such a dietary supplement (Souvenaid®) is unlikely to markedly slow or halt the progression of Alzheimer's dementia. Taking omega-3 fatty acid or vitamin B supplements alone also does not appear to have such an effect.
Do vitamin E supplements increase the likelihood of early death?,"['The result: more deaths occur in the vitamin E group than in the comparison group without vitamin supplements.', 'This meta-analysis also results in a slightly increased number of deaths due to vitamin E preparations.', 'This calculates an increased risk of premature death in vitamin E intake by three percent [2].']",0,"The provided sentences offer evidence that vitamin E supplements may be associated with a slight increase in mortality, as stated in the claim, but they do not explicitly confirm a three percent increased risk of premature death.","Studies on this topic are very inconsistent. Nevertheless, there is a possibility that vitamin E increases the risk of death. A meta-analysis warns against high-dose vitamin preparations."
Does meditation help against stress?,"['Stress reduction in healthy people is shown, but not whether it is actually due to treatment.', 'A new review [3] summarizes 47 studies and brings better data – even if things remain complicated: Although some forms of meditation work against stress, only in comparison to control groups that receive no other targeted treatment.', 'The authors of an overview of mindfulness-based stress reduction [4] report in their summary that this form of therapy improves mental health, both in healthy people and in some patients with mental illnesses.', 'According to the systematic review work of 2014, not all types of meditation are equally effective: for mindfulness-based meditation, an effectiveness can be demonstrated, but not for transcendental meditation, in which the concentration of attention is sought to dissolve [3].']",0,"While some forms of meditation have been shown to reduce stress compared to control groups with no other targeted treatment, the effectiveness of all types of meditation in stress reduction is not uniform, as mindfulness-based meditation demonstrates effectiveness but transcendental meditation does not.","Various forms of meditation seem to be able to alleviate stress both in healthy individuals and in people with mental illness. Studies on this are numerous, but the quality of the studies is consistently unsatisfactory."
Are there methods that effectively help against hormonal hair loss?,"['The efficacy of the active substance minoxidil is very well secured.', 'Regular use of a 2 or 3% minoxidil solution on the scalp may lead to cosmetically significant improvements in approximately three out of ten men affected [6].', 'Also in women with hormonal hair loss shows the treatment with Minoxidil effect.', 'Also scientifically well documented is the effect of finasteride [1] [2] [4] [5] [6].', 'There is evidence that the active substance can improve hormonal hair loss, as it intervenes in the hormone balance similar to finasteride.']",0,"The active substance minoxidil and finasteride have scientifically documented effects in helping against hormonal hair loss, with minoxidil improving hormone balance similarly to finasteride.","Besides own hair transplantation, the active substances finasteride or minoxidil (as a solution) can help, but both agents have side effects. The effectiveness of other means is hardly or not secured."
Does Cryolipolysis cause noticeable body fat reduction?,"['Whether the method can effectively reduce body fat cannot be said based on its results.', 'Whether the reason for the alleged figure improvements after three to six or twelve months was actually the cold treatment, however, can not be determined by previous-after-comparisons without an untreated control group anyway.', 'Even if the authors of previously published studies conjure the effectiveness of cryolipolysis – this cannot be objectively assessed on the basis of their results.']",1,"The claim that cryolipolysis causes noticeable body fat reduction cannot be confirmed based on the provided sentences, as they question the validity of previous results, the role of the cold treatment in figure improvements, and the objectivity of assessing effectiveness.","The effectiveness of cryolipolysis cannot be assessed objectively, as there are no scientific efficacy studies on it."
Is acupuncture for chronic pain more effective than placebo acupuncture treatment?,"['Acupuncture slightly surpasses dummy treatment A recent study is now to show that the pain-relieving effect of acupuncture exceeds that of a mere placebo effect, several media write.', 'The very thorough analysis of all these clinical studies showed that acupuncture in chronic pain was not only better than no treatment, but also slightly better than a sham acupuncture.', 'Also in fibromyalgia, a chronic pain disorder of the musculature, acupuncture probably has a slight, but hardly noticeably better effect than sham acupuncture [9].', 'Even if the mechanism of action of acupuncture is unknown and the placebo effect is partly responsible for its analgesic effect, it appears to be an interesting alternative or additional therapy for patients with chronic pain.']",0,"While some studies suggest a slight advantage of acupuncture over placebo acupuncture in chronic pain relief, the analgesic effect of acupuncture may also be partly due to the placebo effect, making it an interesting alternative or additional therapy.","Acupuncture is slightly superior to sham acupuncture treatment for some types of pain.

Do rising temperatures and CO2 levels increase the risk of pollen allergy?,"['It is unclear whether the increase in CO2 has already caused a noticeable increase in the amount of pollen released.', 'Influence on allergy risk unclear However, whether the increasing pollen exposure also increases the risk of developing pollen allergy for non-allergic agents is unclear.', 'Whether higher levels of pollen increase the probability of hay fever is so far unclear [5].', 'There is nothing to read about pollen becoming more aggressive in so far published studies.']",1,"While there is evidence suggesting that increased pollen exposure may not necessarily increase the risk of developing pollen allergy for non-allergic individuals, the relationship between rising temperatures, CO2 levels, and pollen aggressiveness remains unclear due to a lack of relevant studies.","Rising temperatures and increased CO2 concentrations cause plants to produce larger amounts of pollen over a longer period of time. However, it is unclear whether larger amounts of pollen and a longer pollen season increase the likelihood of developing pollen allergy."
Does training on vibration platforms cause a noticeable buildup of muscle strength?,"['Therefore, training on vibration platforms could actually strengthen the muscle strength of the leg muscles.', 'However, compared to conventional strengthening training, the results do not indicate superiority of vibration platforms.', 'According to the results of this study, it could be concluded at most that training on a vibration platform in combination with a diet can lead to weight loss, which could also be achieved by a conventional fitness program or a mere diet without exercise program.']",0,"While training on vibration platforms may strengthen leg muscles to some extent, there is no evidence suggesting it is more effective than conventional strengthening training, and its primary benefit seems to be weight loss when combined with a diet, which can also be achieved through conventional fitness programs or diets without exercise.","Vibration training may be helpful for building muscle strength in the legs, but it is not better than conventional training for this purpose. Whether the method is also suitable for weight reduction has not been sufficiently studied."
Does glucosamine prolong life?,"['This is exactly what happens once again in the article on glucosamine as a life prolonger: The study was conducted on nematodes (fade worms) and mice and in which glucosamine led to an extended life span [1].', 'The conclusion of the researchers: If glucosamine has the same effect in two different species and these processes are also conceivable in humans, then glucosamine is highly likely to prolong life expectancy in humans.', 'Yes, with many limitations There is a cohort study on humans on this question: In 2010, a first evaluation looked at the influence of 20 vitamins or dietary supplements on life expectancy [3]; of these 20 only glucosamine and chondroitin showed a possible relationship with life expectancy.', 'The researchers speculate that glucosamine prolongs life expectancy just as was found in aspirin [2].', 'Until then, the life-prolonging effect of glucosamine remains optimistic speculation with little evidence.']",0,"While some studies suggest a possible relationship between glucosamine and life expectancy in nematodes and mice, human cohort studies provide limited evidence, and the life-prolonging effect remains speculative.","Although research here is still in its infancy and there is only one cohort study in humans besides basic studies, this shows possible effects.

Can lack of sleep cause obesity?,"['So, most likely, lack of sleep is just one of many different factors that can affect weight gain.', 'Cause unclear The mere fact that people with a lack of sleep are more likely to be overweight or gain more weight than those who sleep, however, does not necessarily mean that the lack of sleep is the real cause of obesity.', 'People who sleep too little usually have an unhealthy lifestyle in general, so other factors can also play a role in increasing weight gain.', ""Whether lack of sleep actually makes you fat can't be said from previous study results – even if there is evidence that people who sleep little may become overweight rather than people with normal sleep.""]",1,"While research suggests a correlation between lack of sleep and increased likelihood of obesity, it does not definitively establish lack of sleep as the cause, as other factors associated with poor sleep habits could also contribute to weight gain.",People who regularly get too little sleep may be more likely to be overweight than those who get enough sleep. But whether lack of sleep itself causes obesity is unclear.
Is breaking an energy-saving lamp harmful to health?,"['[3] If an energy-saving lamp breaks, the mercury contained therein escapes, among other things, in the form of mercury vapour.', 'However, these experiments did not directly investigate whether this could lead to signs of poisoning in humans.', 'Even if the safety limit has been exceeded in some cases, mercury vapour concentrations in the ambient air did not reach levels for which a health hazard is considered probable in any study.']",1,"While mercury vapor is released when an energy-saving lamp breaks, studies have not established a probable health hazard from increased mercury vapor concentrations in ambient air, even when safety limits were exceeded.","If an energy-saving lamp breaks, mercury vapor is released in quantities that can exceed the limits considered safe.

Does psychotherapy help with burnout?,"['Most of the studies on burnout symptoms deal with cognitive behavioral therapy.', 'According to a systematic review [1] Cognitive behavioral therapy seems to be able to alleviate the consequences of permanent stress in the longer term.', 'Physiotherapy showed no better success than standard treatment in a study after six or twelve months.', 'However, more studies would be needed to make a clear assessment.']",0,"The claim is partially supported by a systematic review indicating that cognitive behavioral therapy can alleviate the consequences of permanent stress in the long term, although more studies are needed to make a clear assessment.","Of the psychotherapy modalities, only Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) has evidence of potential efficacy for burnout. For other forms of psychotherapy, the scientific evidence is unclear or non-existent."
Is electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) in combination with ordinary fitness training more efficient than fitness training alone?,"['However, according to a meta-analysis summarising the results of 17 studies, the effect is no greater than in conventional strengthening exercises [ 1 ].', 'Full-body EMS as a fitness method hardly investigated While the electrical stimulation of individual muscle groups for therapeutic purposes was investigated by some research groups, there are hardly any scientific studies on the whole-body EMS as a fitness training replacement.']",1,"The claim is not supported by the first sentence, which states that a meta-analysis of 17 studies found no greater effect from EMS in combination with fitness training compared to conventional strengthening exercises alone.","There is evidence for the principle effectiveness of EMS for muscle strengthening. For a superiority of the combination of EMS and ordinary training compared to fitness training alone, the evidence is contradictory."
Can vitamin and nutrient supplements prevent the eye disease age-related macular degeneration?,"['Progress probably slows down In fact, the summarized results of previously published studies show that a combination of vitamin C, E, beta-carotene and zinc can probably maintain the increasingly deteriorating vision longer.', 'However, the fact that a vitamin mix seems to slow the progression of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is largely due to the results of a single study conducted by the US ""AREDS"" research team [1] [3].', 'This study examined a mixture of 500 mg vitamin C, 400 IU vitamin E, 15 mg beta-carotene, 80 mg zinc oxide and 2 mg copper oxide.', 'It is well established that vitamin E and beta-carotene are not suitable for prevention – they cannot prevent the ocular disease from developing in old age.']",2,"The claim is partially supported by a single study conducted by the US ""AREDS"" research team, which suggests that a specific combination of vitamins and minerals can slow the progression of age-related macular degeneration, but there is no evidence that these supplements can prevent the disease from developing.","Vitamin E and beta-carotene cannot prevent the development of age-related macular degeneration. However, in combination with zinc and vitamin C, they probably allow certain forms of an existing disease to progress somewhat more slowly."
Can they delay the progression of eye disease?,"['Progress probably slows down In fact, the summarized results of previously published studies show that a combination of vitamin C, E, beta-carotene and zinc can probably maintain the increasingly deteriorating vision longer.', 'For those with early signs of macular degeneration, this would mean: Without vitamins and minerals, the disease would progress strongly in 15 out of 1000 patients within six years With vitamins and minerals, it would be 11 out of 1000, i.e.']",0,"The summarized results of studies indicate that a combination of certain vitamins and minerals can potentially slow down the progression of eye disease and maintain deteriorating vision longer, as evidenced by a decrease in disease progression from 15 to 11 out of 1000 patients within six years.","Vitamin E and beta-carotene cannot prevent the development of age-related macular degeneration. However, in combination with zinc and vitamin C, they probably allow certain forms of an existing disease to progress somewhat more slowly."
Do milk or dairy products promote colon cancer and rectal cancer?,"['For ovarian cancer, breast cancer and cancer of the uterine mucosa, the authors of extensive systematic reviews have so far found no evidence of a reduction in risk or an increase in risk [3] [4] [5].', 'However, the study situation is still too unclear to draw definitive conclusions, which requires more and more meaningful studies.', 'There is also the possibility that dairy products will reduce the likelihood of bladder cancer.']",2,"The claim that milk or dairy products promote colon cancer and rectal cancer is not supported by the provided sentences, which only discuss the relationship between dairy and other types of cancer.","It is likely that dairy products reduce the risk of colon and rectal cancer, and possibly bladder cancer. However, very large amounts of milk & dairy products could possibly increase the risk of prostate cancer. It should be remembered that about the same number of men die from colon and rectal cancer as from prostate cancer. For breast and ovarian cancer and cancer of the endometrium, it is unclear whether cancer risk is affected by milk and dairy products."
Does yoga change the genetic makeup?,"['The genes themselves remain unchanged, only their activity fluctuates; just as in each cell the activity of the different genes is adjusted according to current needs.', 'The difference between a liver cell and a muscle cell is not due to different genes, but to different gene activity.', 'The study shows that shortly after the activity, the gene activity differs from certain white blood cells in these two groups.']",1,"The genes themselves remain unchanged in yoga practitioners, with only their activity fluctuating according to current needs, which is consistent with the claim.",Yoga - like any other physical activity - can influence the activity of genes. But the genes themselves are not changed by it.
Which of the three most common laser eye surgeries produces the best results and has the fewest side effects?,"['However, the study situation is still rather thin, new and large studies could still change somewhat in this assessment.', 'At present, all three methods lead to very good results, which, according to the first long-term studies [3], are likely to be sustainable.', 'Results from a few years ago are no longer meaningful today because the treatment method has changed.', 'Long-term studies therefore always refer to the state of the art at that time, but already suggest that laser treatments are safe and sustainable [1] [2] [3].']",0,"While current long-term studies indicate that all three laser eye surgeries lead to safe and sustainable results, the study situation is still evolving, and recent treatment method changes make it difficult to rely on older results.","If only new studies are considered, all three techniques are equally successful. Probable advantages of LASIK: less pain after surgery and good vision more quickly."
"Can electromagnetic fields with a specific pattern (pulsed electromagnetic fields, PEMF) heal injuries?","['Evidence that this pattern in particular has a good therapeutic effect has not been provided.', 'In fact, only a randomized-controlled study on fatigue in multiple sclerosis (MS) [1] and some laboratory results can be found.', 'Apart from the fact that a study on fatigue in a particular disease naturally does not say anything about effects on completely different symptoms, this one study is not yet meaningful: there were very few participants (37) and the intake of medications differed in the experimental and control groups.', 'Many approaches, little evidence Even if the whole variety of similar treatments is considered, there are not enough good studies to prove an effect of PEMF therapies.', 'For a meaningful assessment of PEMF as a form of therapy, studies with good methodology, a higher number of participants and a comparison of the different forms of application (among others) are missing.']",1,"The claim that pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMF) can heal injuries is not supported by the provided evidence, as there is only one small study on fatigue in multiple sclerosis and some laboratory results, with no substantial evidence for other symptoms or diseases, and a lack of high-quality studies comparing different forms of PEMF application.","No good injury studies can be found on the device. The only randomized-controlled study treats fatigue in patients with the incurable nerve disease multiple sclerosis and is not very conclusive. Even for the whole range of similar treatment methods, there is no sufficient evidence of efficacy."
Can cancer be successfully fought with intentionally induced fever?,"['==References== In the 19th century, the idea was born that fevers protect against cancer.', 'No major modern studies have been conducted in which deliberately triggered fever has been tested as therapy.']",1,"While the concept of fever as a cancer protector originated in the 19th century, no recent major studies have tested fever induction as therapy, leaving insufficient evidence to support or refute the claim.","In the early 20th century, cancer was indeed sometimes fought with fever, sometimes successfully. But the therapies and trials are poorly documented and were risky. An assessment of efficacy is not possible based on the studies to date."
Can some forms of headache be successfully treated with heat?,"['Accordingly, there is no scientific evidence of the effectiveness of this measure.', 'However, there is no sufficient evidence to support this claim.', 'A Cochrane overview work from 2004 [1] investigates all non-invasive physical treatment methods for all forms of headache: Heat treatment plays only a very small role according to this study (dryer is not mentioned) – heat was tested in combination with other measures: In one study, the combination of heat, home training and stretching is worse than a combination of biofeedback and relaxation.']",1,"While some studies have shown that heat can be beneficial for certain types of headaches when used in combination with other measures, a Cochrane overview work from 2004 found that heat has only a minor role in treating headaches, and dryer was not even mentioned in the study.","Heat on tense muscles is pleasant, but no evidence exists that the tension is released and the headache is relieved."
Does electro-acupuncture on the ear help against pain?,"['Thus, the repeated electrical irritation of acupuncture points on the ear seems to be able to stop some chronic neck or cross pain [ 2, 3 ].', 'The pain could not be brought to total disappearance, but the study participants needed less painkillers than without electro-acupuncture over the duration of a few weeks.', 'Acupuncture on the ear probably effective against pain Overall, different acupuncture methods on the ear may effectively reduce pain.']",0,"The sentences provide evidence that electro-acupuncture on the ear can reduce the need for painkillers in people with chronic neck or cross pain, but they do not indicate that it can completely eliminate pain.","Electro-ear acupuncture could be supportive against chronic pain such as neck or low back pain. The method cannot completely replace painkillers. For surgery-related pain, the effectiveness is uncertain."
Does treatment with the new drug erenumab reduce the number of migraine days per month?,"['In other words, compared to a sham medication, individuals with episodic migraines were spared on average 1 to 2 migraine days per month by erenumab [1-4].', 'So far no serious side effects The side effects of erenumab – as far as the earlier rather shorter studies at least – do not seem to be serious: those who used erenumab complained a little more frequently than those with the dummy medication about injection site reactions, constipation, muscle cramps and itching [6].', 'Because erenumab has so far only been compared with placebo.', 'No long-term data The results on efficacy and safety first sound as if people with a similar condition as in the studies could actually benefit from erenumab.']",0,"The claim is partially supported by the first sentence, which indicates that individuals with episodic migraines experienced fewer migraine days per month with erenumab compared to a sham medication; however, the claim cannot be fully evaluated due to the lack of comparisons with other treatments beyond a placebo and the absence of long-term data, as mentioned in the third and fourth sentences.","In five studies available to date, which tend to be shorter, participants suffered from migraine less frequently with erenumab than with a placebo. The studies were of high methodological quality. In episodic migraine, people ""saved"" about 1 to 2 migraine days per month . For chronic migraine, sufferers had about 2.5 fewer days of pain per month. However, the efficacy and safety data relate to a maximum time frame of six months; the long-term benefit still needs to be explored. The benefit of erenumab compared to other established preventive migraine drugs has also not yet been researched."
Is screening by optical coherence tomography superior to conventional examinations for the early detection of diabetic macular edema?,"['Early detection: Optical coherence tomography unreliable Most diabetes patients with such pathological retinal damage will not notice symptoms such as dark spots in the field of vision or impairment of sharp vision long after the start.', 'However, laser treatment is not without risk, in some cases it may also result in an unwanted reduction in vision or other side effects that affect vision.']",2,"The claim is refuted by the first sentence, which states that early detection of diabetic macular edema with optical coherence tomography can be unreliable, as many patients with pathological retinal damage may not notice symptoms for a long time.","No, screening by optical coherence tomography alone is too inaccurate. An examination using an ophthalmoscope and pupil dilating eye drops or with the help of fundus photography is a safer method."
Does the treatment of diabetes-related retinal diseases by injection of VEGF inhibitors provide an advantage compared to conventional laser treatment?,"['The majority (5 out of 100 inhabitants) suffer from type 2 diabetes (formerly also called age diabetes), which is practically always lifestyle-related and in most cases is accompanied by overweight, one-sided diet and lack of exercise [ 4 ].', 'The presentation of the effectiveness of VEGF inhibitor injections as a new treatment method is also clearly exaggerated and biased – the newspaper article does not inform about risks and uncertainties.']",0,"The claim does not provide a direct comparison between VEGF inhibitor injections and conventional laser treatment for diabetes-related retinal diseases, and the sentences do not offer information about the relative efficacy or risks of these treatments.","There is evidence of better short-term efficacy for VEGF inhibitor injections compared with laser coagulation, but the method is insufficiently studied. Whether the effect is safe in the long term and effective at the same time is unclear."
"Do plant extracts of African plum tree, beta-sitosterol or ryegrass pollen extract (Cernilton) help benign prostate enlargement?","['[5] Frustrating: most of the time evidence is missing Although some plants have been or are being traded as promising candidates in scientific literature: Unfortunately, up to now almost none of these products can provide up-to-date, sound evidence of good and long-term effectiveness.']",1,"The claim that plant extracts of African plum tree, beta-sitosterol, or ryegrass pollen extract (Cernilton) help benign prostate enlargement is not supported by the provided sentences, as most of the time evidence is missing and almost none of these products can provide up-to-date, sound evidence of good and long-term effectiveness.","Many men with benign prostate enlargement turn to herbal remedies. However, current evidence for reliable and long-term efficacy is generally lacking, and most remedies are not well studied. It is therefore not possible to lump all products together. Preparations containing the plant ingredient beta-sitosterol, extracts of the African plum tree or ryegrass pollen extract could possibly lead to some improvement - however, this cautious assumption is based on outdated data. However, the current finding is this: remedies containing saw palmetto do not work any better than placebo and are thus considered ineffective."
Are there medical benefits to wearing a bra?,"['No evidence that a bra changes the breast In our extensive searches, we only received one piece of work on the subject: in 1990 eleven women in Japan were examined how the consistent wearing of a strong supportive bra affects [1].', 'A change in shape of the chest by bras is thus not proven, just as no health benefits by omitting a bra.', 'Instead, we found the opposite recommendation: women who occasionally suffer from aching breasts could allegedly get relief with a well-seated bra [5-7].', 'Whether wearing a bra helps against aching breasts is scientifically unproven.', 'Also the studies, on the basis of which it is recommended to wear a well-seated bra in a painful breasts, are not meaningful: In a work already over 40 years old 114 women with a painful breast got to wear a well-suited bra, for which they could choose from 144 different sizes [2].']",1,"The claim that there are medical benefits to wearing a bra is not supported by the provided sentences, as there is no substantial evidence presented and the studies mentioned do not prove any health benefits or a change in shape of the chest.","Whether it is healthier or even beneficial not to wear a bra cannot be answered due to a lack of studies.

Do vein preparations for external use help with varicose veins or chronic venous insufficiency?,"['But unfortunately, there is currently no sound scientific evidence that the externally applicable means could alleviate venous ailments [1].', 'Whether varicose veins-contaminated legs help a therapy with cyanoacrylate – a kind of superglue intended to seal the affected vein – is currently unclear, as Medizin-transparent.at has already illuminated in its own article.', 'After most studies focused on symptoms such as itching or tension in the legs, we cannot assess whether the venous products for swallowing could slow the progression of chronic vein weakness.', 'Many questions unresolved Even if venous agents for swallowing should relieve symptoms of varicose veins and vein weakness, many questions remain open: What is the optimal dose for the respective venous agent?']",1,"While some studies have investigated the impact of oral venous products on varicose vein symptoms like itching or tension, there is currently no sound scientific evidence that externally applicable means can alleviate venous ailments, leaving the claim unsupported.","At present, it is not possible to assess the efficacy of ointments, gels or creams because studies on these products are lacking. The situation is different for vein remedies to be swallowed. Studies suggest that some may improve symptoms of varicose veins or chronic venous insufficiency, such as itching, restless or swollen legs, pain and cramps. Quite likely, the remedies are likely to help with water retention in the legs (edema) caused by venous disease.
