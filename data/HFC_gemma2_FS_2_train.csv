Does paxlovid protect unvaccinated people with risk factors from severe or even fatal covid 19 disease?,"['Patients at risk without corona vaccination appear to be well protected from serious to fatal events by Paxlovid.', 'However, it is not certain how well Paxlovid helps people who have already received corona vaccination.', 'In addition, the scientists investigated whether Paxlovid alleviated the Covid-19 symptoms, shortened the duration of the disease and reduced the need for medical treatment: Half of the participants improved the symptoms with Paxlovid after 13 days, with placebo after 15 days.', 'With Paxlovid, 14 out of 1000 participants needed medical treatment for Covid-19 within a month, with placebo 76 out of 1000.', 'Whether with or without antibodies in the blood, Paxlovid basically protected all humans from a severe course.']",0,"The provided sentences suggest that Paxlovid offers protection against severe COVID-19 outcomes for individuals at risk who are not vaccinated.  
","In a large, well-done study, paxlovid prevented hospitalizations and deaths in high-risk patients. They were unvaccinated and had contracted the delta variant. For vaccinated people, the benefit cannot be reliably estimated. This also applies to people with immunodeficiency."
Does the consumption of soy foods or soy isoflavones affect the appearance of acne skin?,"['In both cases, certain soya ingredients are responsible for the effect on the skin: the isoflavones.', 'There are two competing theories that contradict each other: according to the first theory, isoflavones confuse the hormone balance and are supposed to promote acne in this way.', 'Surprisingly, despite searching in two large databases, we could not find a study on soy products and acne â€“ whether soy milk, soy sauce or tofu.', 'The isoflavones improved the skin appearance more than an anti-acne cream with vitamin A acid (Tretinoin).', 'Conclusion: There is currently no evidence from reliable studies that soy makes acne worse.']",1,"While there are theories about how soy isoflavones might affect acne, no studies have been found to confirm or refute this claim.  
","We could not find any meaningful studies at all on the influence of soy foods on acne. On soy isoflavones, we found two small studies of questionable quality that examined a very specific group of sufferers. Soy isoflavones improved the skin appearance somewhat. However, this result is not reliable."
Is the homeopathic remedy Neradin effective for erectile dysfunction?,"['No studies on Neradin Also our search for studies on the product Neradin remained resultless.', 'Studies on the product Neradin also appear to be missing.']",1,"The provided sentences state that no studies on the effectiveness of Neradin for erectile dysfunction could be found.  
","The extract from the Damiana plant (Turnera diffusa) is advertised as a remedy for erectile dysfunction for men. However, this claimed effect on potency is by no means proven. It has apparently never been tested on humans. This also applies to homeopathic remedies such as the product Neradin."
Does regular HPV testing in addition to the recommended Pap smear detect more precancerous lesions than just the Pap smear alone?,"['According to the studies, the HPV test is likely to detect slightly more precursors of cervical cancer over several years than the PAP swab alone.', 'We are therefore relatively sure that with an additional HPV test at least a little more precursors of uterine cancer are detected than only with the PAP swab alone.']",0,"The provided sentences suggest that HPV testing, in combination with a Pap smear, may identify a slightly higher number of precancerous cervical lesions compared to Pap smears alone.  
","Regular examination of the cervix by means of PAP smear tests detects precancerous stages of the cervix in most cases in good time. This reduces the risk of developing cervical cancer. An additional HPV test every three to five years can make screening even more reliable. However, the difference should not be too great."
Can monk's pepper reduce PMS symptoms? PMS is the abbreviation for premenstrual syndrome. This refers to complaints that occur in the days before menstruation.,"['Reference to efficacy in PMS According to previous studies, monk peppers could actually help in PMS.', 'The summarized study results indicate that the symptoms with monk pepper are reduced in more patients than with a sham medication (placebo).', 'Therefore, it would be possible for monk peppers to act against PMS symptoms such as breast spacing.']",0,"The provided sentences suggest that monk pepper may have a positive impact on PMS symptoms based on studies showing symptom reduction in patients compared to a placebo.  
","In the studies to date, monk's pepper seems to relieve PMS symptoms better than a placebo. However, this is not well proven, because the studies have significant weaknesses. There is no evidence of an effect on menstrual disorders. Significant studies are lacking."
Can olive leaf extract reduce high blood pressure?,"['These studies therefore do not indicate whether olive leaf extract can help with significantly increased blood pressure.', 'Without success, however, we could not find any studies that investigated the effect of olive leaf extract on cardiovascular health.', 'However, they cannot provide clear answers.', 'It is therefore impossible to say whether olive leaves extract could have a better or worse effect with significantly increased blood pressure.']",1,"The provided studies do not offer conclusive evidence regarding the impact of olive leaf extract on blood pressure.  
","Whether olive leaf extract lowers blood pressure has been investigated in five suitable studies to date. They all found no effect or only a slight effect of the extract. The problem with this is that most of the study participants had only slightly elevated blood pressure. They cannot answer how olive leaf extract works in people with significantly elevated blood pressure (hypertension). The studies also had gross flaws, few participants, and ran for a very short time. They cannot provide reliable answers."
Do green-lipped mussel preparations improve the symptoms of osteoarthritis?,"['Studies overall not meaningful The conclusion of our research: Scientific evidence for the claimed effect is missing.', 'It is also unclear whether the measured positive effects are large enough to actually be felt by those affected.', 'Whether or not green-lipped mussel helps with osteoarthritis cannot be said at the moment.', 'However, as early as 2009, the European Food Safety Authority considered that a protective effect of the green-lipped mussel on healthy joints has not been established.', 'In our opinion, no reliable conclusions can be drawn from the studies found.']",1,"The available research does not provide conclusive evidence regarding the impact of green-lipped mussel preparations on osteoarthritis symptoms.  
","The question was examined in four small studies with serious methodological deficiencies, which also arrived at partly contradictory results. No clear conclusions can be drawn from them. The claim that green-lipped mussel helps with osteoarthritis is not scientifically proven."
Can probiotics lower blood sugar in type 2 diabetes?,"['And if so, can probiotics reverse this change and reduce blood sugar levels again?', 'At the most small effect, they may actually be able to.', 'However, the effect of the capsules and tablets does not seem to be large: in the previous studies, they were able to reduce the long-term sugar level HbA1c by an average of 0.55 points.']",0,"While some studies suggest probiotics might modestly reduce HbA1c levels, the effect size is small and further research is needed to determine if they can significantly lower blood sugar in type 2 diabetes.  
","The summarized results of studies to date suggest that probiotics in capsule or tablet form could lower blood sugar somewhat. At least if they are taken over a period of two to three months. However, the effect is not well established. Probiotic dairy products and probiotic powder for dissolving do not seem to have any demonstrable effect."
Can the so-called Tupler technique help against rectus diastasis?,"['No studies on the Tupler technique As intense as we were looking for, we could not find the promised studies on the Tupler technique.', 'The claim that this is a scientifically proven therapy for rectus diastase is therefore simply wrong.', 'The studies in detail We did not find any studies that investigated the effectiveness of the Tupler technique for the treatment of rectus diastase.']",1,"The provided sentences state that no studies investigating the Tupler technique for treating rectus diastasis were found.

Can CBD (cannabidiol) help with migraines or other headaches?,"['Apparently, CBD has never been investigated to see if it can help with migraine seizures.', 'The claim that CBD would help with migraines or headaches is pure speculation.', 'The studies in detail Despite extensive search in three databases, we could not find any studies on CBD against migraine or other types of headache, neither for treatment nor for prevention.']",1,"The provided sentences state that no studies have been found investigating the effects of CBD on migraines or headaches.  
",There are no studies that have investigated the effectiveness of CBD against migraine. So claims that CBD can help with or prevent migraine attacks have no scientific basis. The same is true for other types of headache.
Can laser irradiation of blood by infusion needle (hemolaser treatment) relieve discomfort or help with diseases?,"['It is also unclear by what mechanism blood irradiation with bundled red light â€“ i.e.', 'red laser â€“ should improve health.', 'Although the authors of the three studies found [1-3] claim to have established a clear efficacy of haemolaser treatment, none of the three studies is suitable to prove this.']",1,"The provided studies do not offer conclusive evidence regarding the effectiveness of hemolaser treatment in improving health.  
",There is no scientific evidence that hemolaser treatment has a palliative or curative effect on health problems.
Can CBD help with period pain?,"['Because despite searching in three different databases we could not find a single study on CBD in case of regular pain.', 'Scientifically, it is not sufficiently researched whether CBD actually promotes sleep, as providers claim.', 'The studies in detail We could not find any studies that investigated whether CBD can help with normal pain â€“ neither for treatment nor for prevention.']",1,"The provided sentences state that no studies have been found investigating the effects of CBD on regular pain, making it impossible to determine if it is helpful.  
",Whether CBD can relieve menstrual pain has apparently never been scientifically studied. We could not find any studies on this. Women who suffer from severe period pain should talk to a gynecologist about it. Diseases such as endometriosis could be behind it.
"Can a bioresonance device like ""Bioscan"" or ""Vieva Vital Analyser"" measure mineral and vitamin deficiencies or detect health problems?","['This experiment clearly shows that the devices studied are completely unsuitable to diagnose a lack of vitamins or minerals.', 'Sentenced for fraud at the end of May 2022, a German court also concluded that the Bioscan device cannot fulfil the claimed claims.', 'Claims for comparable products are equally implausible.', 'Even if 1000 subjects had participated in the study and only five to six people had shown such unreliable readings, such a device would be worthless for diagnostics.']",2,"The provided sentences state that the devices in question have been found unsuitable for diagnosing vitamin or mineral deficiencies and that claims made about similar products are implausible. 
","An experiment shows that the devices cannot distinguish between healthy people, seriously ill people and a corpse. The claimed mode of action behind the measurement method is also scientifically implausible. A German court has convicted the manufacturers of the Bioscan device (not legally binding) of fraud."
Does arthroscopy (joint endoscopy) help with osteoarthritis of the knee joint?,"['What might sound logical, however, has a catch: the arthroscopy of osteoarthritis does nothing to the treated person.', 'Studies clearly speak against a benefit A research team summarized the most meaningful of all previously published studies on arthroscopy in knee arthritis.', 'In these studies, patients treated after arthroscopy had no noticeably less pain or movement restrictions than those treated only for appearance or not at all.', 'Arthroscopy against osteoarthritis: not effective, but also not very risky After all: Undesirable events were not conspicuously common in the arthroscopy groups either.']",2,"The provided research indicates that arthroscopy does not demonstrably improve pain or mobility limitations in individuals with osteoarthritis of the knee.

Does red wine protect better against cardiovascular disease than white wine?,"['However, they usually did not distinguish between white and red wine [1] [2] [3].', 'It can therefore not be proven that red wine protects particularly well against cardiovascular diseases.', 'Thus, people who consume small amounts of alcohol daily seem to have a lower cardiovascular risk and live a little longer than strict non-drinkers [1] [2] [3] [4].', 'The result: For a moderate dose of eight to ten grams of pure alcohol per day, the overall mortality and risk of cardiovascular disease were lower than for non- or minor drinkers.', 'The impact of the studies is limited Even if people who eat a glass of wine or beer daily live longer and healthier, this does not necessarily mean that alcoholic beverages are responsible.']",1,"While some studies suggest a correlation between moderate alcohol consumption and lower cardiovascular risk, they don't definitively prove that red wine offers superior protection compared to white wine.  
","There is evidence that moderate amounts of alcohol may protect against cardiovascular disease, but the effect is not well established. Whether this possibly protective effect is stronger with red wine than with white wine or other alcoholic beverages has not been sufficiently investigated."
Do azo food dyes cause attention deficit disorder and hyperactivity in children?,"['Since 2010, the EU has committed manufacturers to label food with azo dyes ""May affect the activity and attention of children"".', 'However, the summarized results of these and other previously published studies provide clear evidence that artificial food colours can cause attention and hyperactivity disorder (ADHS).', 'Although the bright-colored dyes could be a partial cause of ADHD, there are certainly many other unknown triggers [5].', 'The studies in detail The fact that azo dyes could be responsible for behavioural abnormalities of children suggests a clean summary of previous studies [2].', 'Compared to children who continued to consume azo dyes, behavioural abnormalities decreased slightly.']",0,"While some studies suggest a possible link between azo dyes and behavioral issues in children, the evidence is not conclusive and other factors may be involved.

Does turmeric prevent or cure cancer?,"['However, well-executed studies of this kind have so far been scarce.', 'After 6 months of administration, the values did not differ between turmeric and dummy subjects.', 'This makes it unclear whether any improvement observed is due to turmeric treatment or whether the health status of the study participants would have improved without turmeric.']",1,"The provided sentences highlight the lack of conclusive evidence regarding turmeric's impact on cancer, suggesting further research is needed.  
",Animal studies provide tentative evidence that turmeric can prevent or treat cancer. Whether turmeric has such an effect in humans cannot be assessed due to the low confidence level of a few studies conducted to date.
Does breastfeeding reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome?,"['The scientists conclude that the risk of breastfed children is halved compared to un breastfed children [2].', 'However, the matter has a small catch: the studies analysed show a connection.', 'The studies in detail The fact that breastfeeding reduces the risk of unexpected death of a baby is only moderately secure.', 'However, this does not necessarily prove that breastfeeding is the reason for the lower risk of infant death.']",0,"While studies suggest a link between breastfeeding and a reduced risk of sudden infant death syndrome, they do not definitively prove causation.  
","Breastfeeding can possibly reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome, but this is not entirely certain. Other factors can also reduce the risk."
"Do boron preparations such as borax, boric acid, or calcium fructoborate relieve pain associated with age-related joint wear (osteoarthritis)?","['Even if their authors want to give a positive impression in their work â€“ a critical look at the data shows that the Borax tablets could not alleviate arthrosis complaints among the participants.', 'There is no evidence that borax or boric acid can actually improve the discomfort in people with worn joints.', 'Those who suffer from chronic osteoarthritis pains and stiff joints and are hoping for relief through Borax should rely on more effective alternatives.']",1,"The provided sentences express skepticism about the effectiveness of boron preparations in alleviating osteoarthritis pain, citing a lack of evidence for their efficacy.  
","The few studies on this are of poor quality and therefore not trustworthy. Moreover, there is no evidence that the human body needs boron at all."
Does the Orthopulse device accelerate the orthodontic correction of malocclusions?,"['Little meaningful The three published studies [1-3] cannot convince: None of the studies actually investigates the entire duration of treatment, but only the speed of tooth movements in the correction phase of brace therapy.', 'This does not make any sure statements about the reduction of the overall duration of treatment with which the manufacturer advertises.', 'Theoretically, two effects of orthopulses would be conceivable: positive effects if the duration of treatment were shortened, or negative effects if conversion processes at the tooth root were accelerated.', 'Thus, it is also questionable whether the faster treatment with the orthopulse device actually results from infrared therapy: In the control group, the teeth move on average by 0.44 mm per week, in the group with the orthopulse device on average by 1.27 mm per week.']",1,"While the sentences mention faster tooth movement with the Orthopulse device, they also highlight the lack of studies examining the full treatment duration and question whether the observed speed is solely due to infrared therapy.  
",Poorly done studies show that the device can accelerate tooth movement in the short term. Whether this reduces the overall treatment time has not yet been sufficiently proven. The methodological weaknesses of the studies also mean that the results are not very credible. Possible side effects have not yet been sufficiently investigated.
Is it harmful for the mental development of the unborn child if the mother regularly eats fish contaminated with mercury during pregnancy?,"['For previous studies suggest that the consumption of larger amounts of mercury-containing fish could slightly affect the mental performance of the offspring [1, 2, 3].', 'The studies in detail The fact that methyl mercury can damage the brain of unborn children already in concentrations in which the pregnant mothers themselves do not notice any symptoms is beyond question [6].', 'In investigations into the Faroe Islands and New Zealand, the assumption was confirmed: expectant mothers with high mercury levels were given children, whose mental performance was on average slightly worse in later tests than that of unloaded mothers â€“ the mercury levels of the mothers were mostly so high, because they had consumed large amounts of contaminated fish before and during pregnancy.', 'Impact on the IQ Despite these contradictions, the consumption of contaminated fish seems to reduce the intelligence of the offspring measurable, although it is not yet clear how much.', ""A research team at Harvard University calculated an average reduction in the intelligence ratio of 0.7 points for each micrograms of mercury in mother's hair [2] in the analysis of studies from the Faroe Islands, Seychelles and New Zealand.""]",0,"Several studies indicate a correlation between maternal mercury consumption from fish and slightly reduced mental performance in offspring.

Can the consumption of caffeine during pregnancy harm the unborn child?,"['However, the study showed that it made no difference whether the participants drank around three cups of caffeine or decaffeinated coffee.', ""On average, the weight of birth at birth was about the same, was similar in size and was not more frequently born too early even after the mother's caffeine consumption."", 'Similar to the summary of the Cochrane overview work: In early pregnancy three cups of coffee daily would have no effect on birth weight, growth or premature birth [2].']",1,"The provided sentences suggest that consuming around three cups of caffeine daily during pregnancy does not appear to have a negative impact on birth weight, size, or the likelihood of premature birth.  
",There is insufficient evidence that moderate consumption of caffeinated beverages would have a negative impact on the child's development. Up to three cups of coffee a day does not appear to reduce the child's birth weight. Very large amounts of caffeine-containing beverages could possibly contribute to lower birth weight.
Are vegetables prepared in a microwave oven less healthy than those prepared in other ways?,"['Recent studies see the matter more differentiated: Depending on the variety of vegetables and the exact type of preparation, the microwave can sometimes be better and sometimes worse suited than, for example, cooking [2-12].', 'In the worst case, if it is exaggerated with the duration and the number of watts, the corresponding food is less health-promoting, but in no way harmful to health.', 'If there are health problems related to the microwave, then this is not because the microwave ingredients are destroyed or changed, but because it is simply too unhealthy to eat altogether.', 'The week-long feeding with always several times warmed up in the microwave has not led to any signs of poisoning in the animals.']",2,"The provided sentences suggest that microwave cooking can sometimes be as good or even better than other methods for preparing vegetables, but excessive use of high power can lead to less healthy outcomes. 
","How vegetables change during preparation is extremely variable. With any type of heating, ingredients can be lost or become more easily accessible. In sum, it cannot be said that preparation in the microwave is always a bad choice."

","In the case of migraine, the preventive effect of acupuncture is probably similar to that of prophylactic medication. However, for both migraine and tension headaches, acupuncture performs only slightly better than sham acupuncture. Whether the pricking of traditional acupuncture points plays a role is unclear."
Can green tea reduce the likelihood of dying from cancer ?,"['In some studies, there was indeed a slightly reduced probability of disease, but other studies even suggested an increased risk of cancer from the use of green tea.', 'The result provides sobering clarity: people who regularly drink large amounts of green tea die in sum as often at some kind of cancer as people who hardly touch green tea [8].', 'To a degree harmless Although the benefits of green tea against cancer are questionable, there is no evidence of a health-impairing effect in moderate consumption of some cups a day [2].']",2,"While some studies suggest a potential link between green tea consumption and reduced cancer risk, other research indicates a possible increase in cancer risk, leaving the overall impact unclear.

(Reader inquiry)","['According to a systematic review [ 1 ], the risk of adverse reactions after a combination of six-fold vaccination plus pneumococcal vaccination increases slightly.', 'In summary, the co-administration of pneumococcal and previous six-fold vaccination shows no reduced protection against the pathogens, while the risk of adverse reactions is slightly increased.']",0,"The provided sentences suggest that while combining the six-dose vaccine with the pneumococcal vaccine does not appear to lessen protection against the targeted diseases, there is a slight increase in the likelihood of adverse reactions.  
","Simultaneous vaccination with pneumococcal and six-way vaccine results in essentially equivalent protection against the 6 pathogens compared with six-way vaccination alone. The somewhat increased risk of fever after vaccination is offset by additional, nearly complete protection against pneumococcal infection and infection."
Can phthalates cause diabetes?,"['The authors of two recently published studies found significantly higher concentrations of phthalates in the body in diabetic patients than in those without diabetes [1] [2].', 'No direct evidence for diabetes cause, but indications Even if there are increased concentrations of various phthalates in the body in diabetics as well as in people with a diabetes precursor â€“ this is not proof that phthalates trigger diabetes.']",0,"While studies show higher phthalate concentrations in diabetic patients, this doesn't confirm that phthalates cause diabetes.

Is it true that lowering cholesterol does not reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease?,"['Study participants who consumed less salt and fat, but more fruits, vegetables and fiber, were able to lower their LDL cholesterol levels and blood pressure slightly.', 'Especially a Mediterranean diet with lots of fruits, vegetables, nuts, olive oil and fish as well as little red meat and dairy products seems to have a positive effect on heart health.', 'However, this does not mean that all cholesterol-lowering agents automatically reduce the cardiovascular risk.', 'Cholesterol only one of many heart risk factors Cholesterol is by no means the only factor that increases the likelihood of cardiovascular diseases such as heart attack or stroke.', 'Quitting smoking also significantly reduces the risk, even if it does not affect cholesterol levels.']",2,"While some lifestyle changes can lower cholesterol and benefit heart health, the provided sentences emphasize that cholesterol is just one factor among many that contribute to cardiovascular disease risk.  
","No. High cholesterol, along with other risk factors, can increase the likelihood of cardiovascular disease. If the proportion of ""bad"" LDL cholesterol in the blood is lowered (with medication or through a change in diet), the risk of diseases such as heart attack or stroke also decreases."
Do static magnets help against pain?,"['Magnets are pure magic â€“ with an invisible hand they attract something, push each other off and in a large style they even let whole moves float.', 'Does the magic of magnets also affect the human body?', 'There they are supposed to calm pain, heal wounds, protect against joint wear (arthrosis) or simply improve the general well-being.', 'Effekt refuted In 2007, an overview of the studies on magnets against pain was summarized [1] : The result shows that magnets do not work better than a sham treatment (placebo).', 'The question is important in that it is estimated that almost a third of all osteoarthritis patients in the USA use magnets in some form [1].']",2,"While some believe magnets can alleviate pain, heal wounds, and improve well-being, research indicates they are no more effective than a placebo.  
",Both a somewhat older review and several high-quality randomized controlled trials show that magnets do not work better than sham treatment.

","Whether vitamin D supplements can increase the risk of food allergy in the unborn child is unclear, as studies on this issue have yielded conflicting results."
Can negative expectancy reduce the effect of pain medications?,"['Benefits and damage from nothing In randomized controlled studies, the nocebo effect can be observed well.']",2,"The provided sentences discuss the nocebo effect, which is a negative response to a treatment due to expectations, suggesting a potential link between negative expectancy and treatment outcomes.  
","Studies clearly show that ineffective placebo can bring severe side effects, depending on the patient's expectations. One effect can also be that the effectiveness of painkillers is limited."
Is sex as good an endurance workout as running?,"['Canadian researchers compared the energy consumption during sex with a moderate training on a treadmill [1].', 'The result: In a sexual act, both men and women consume significantly less calories on average than in a half-hour treadmill training [1].', 'According to study authors, the performance would be roughly like a leisurely walk.', 'One person found that sex was not more beneficial than treadmill training, whether woman or man is not stated.']",2,"The provided study indicates that sexual activity burns fewer calories than a moderate treadmill workout, suggesting it is not as intense an endurance exercise.  
","Studies show that physical exertion during sex is present but rather moderate. Compared with targeted exercise, the energy expenditure is lower."
Can electrical brain stimulation reduce the amount of food eaten?,"['In two of these [3] [4], the researchers let their subjects eat buffets at will, both after a dummy treatment and after a real electrical brain stimulation.', 'The result: in one of the two studies [3] the tDCS treatment caused the subjects to eat less compared to the dummy treatment.', 'Despite the contradictory results, the participants of both studies indicated that they felt less cravings if they had previously received electrical brain stimulation.', 'Magnetic brain stimulation (rTMS) does not seem to be able to mitigate these ""eating attacks"", according to the cautious results of two small studies [2].', 'Adverse reactions of electrical brain stimulation TDCS were approximately as common in patients treated with sham in clinical trials conducted so far.']",1,"While one study suggests electrical brain stimulation can reduce food intake, another study found no effect on ""eating attacks"" and participants' experiences varied.  
","Electrical brain stimulation may be able to reduce short-term cravings for high-calorie foods. However, it is unclear that the treated persons actually eat less of them; study results on this are contradictory."
Are plastic kitchen boards more hygienic than wooden ones?,"['A thorough search for studies on this issue reveals contradictory results.', 'Some laboratory studies [1-3] [8,9] seem to show that wooden boards are definitely not more hygienic than artificial boards, but in other studies there are no hygiene differences: wooden boards could be released from bacteria as well as plastic [4,5] [7].', 'On the other hand, wooden boards had been used much less frequently by the Salmonella sufferers.']",1,"The provided research offers conflicting evidence regarding the hygiene comparison between plastic and wooden kitchen boards. 
",Whether wooden boards in the kitchen have hygienic disadvantages is unclear. Previous studies on this are too contradictory to answer this question clearly.
Does excessive beer or alcohol consumption lead to obesity?,"['In some studies, it seems to be exactly the opposite, beer lovers weigh less than little drinkers at the time of the survey.', 'In such a study, men who drank less than three litres a week even seemed to lose weight, and not to increase in weekly amounts of six litres or more.', 'Studies comparing beer with other non-alcoholic beverages other than non-alcoholic beer do not show a clear difference in weight.', 'One reason, according to the authors of an overview of 2011 [2], could be that wine drinkers may tend to become a healthier diet overall.', 'It is also possible that alcohol only has an influence on fat folds on the abdomen and hips from a large amount of time, but it does not lead to weight gain in moderation.']",1,"The provided sentences present mixed findings on the relationship between alcohol consumption and weight, with some studies suggesting a potential inverse correlation and others highlighting the influence of diet and alcohol type. 
","In some studies, alcohol consumption does seem to be related to weight gain. In other studies, however, there is either no effect or even the opposite effect. The study situation is contradictory."
Do omega-3 fatty acids or a diet rich in fish help with rheumatoid arthritis?,"['Is this supported by scientific data?', 'Anti-rheumatism effect unproven A Korean team of researchers summarized the results of previously published randomized-controlled studies [1] that investigated the effects of omega-3 fatty acid preparations in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.', 'Their conclusion: there is no valid evidence for such a positive effect in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.']",1,"A review of existing studies found no evidence to support the claim that omega-3 fatty acids or a fish-rich diet have a positive effect on rheumatoid arthritis.  
","According to the majority of studies, preparations with omega-3 fatty acids cannot improve pain and other symptoms in rheumatoid arthritis. However, the results are sometimes contradictory. The effectiveness of preparations made from the New Zealand green-lipped mussel is also unclear. Whether a diet rich in fish helps is insufficiently studied."
Does unprocessed red meat increase the risk of cardiovascular disease?,"['They found no connection between the consumption of unprocessed red meat and heart disease.', 'However, the study results contradict each other, so we do not know whether meat can actually cause cardiovascular disease [4].', 'Whether the cause of the increased probability of disease was actually the consumption of red meat cannot be determined from the study data.']",1,"The provided study results are inconclusive about whether unprocessed red meat consumption directly causes cardiovascular disease.  
","Whether unprocessed red meat increases the likelihood of cardiovascular disease is unclear, and study results are conflicting. However, processed red meat such as ham, bacon or sausages could increase the risk."
Does psychotherapy help with burnout?,"['Most of the studies on burnout symptoms deal with cognitive behavioral therapy.', 'According to a systematic review [1] Cognitive behavioral therapy seems to be able to alleviate the consequences of permanent stress in the longer term.', 'Physiotherapy showed no better success than standard treatment in a study after six or twelve months.', 'However, more studies would be needed to make a clear assessment.']",0,"While some studies suggest cognitive behavioral therapy may be beneficial for managing stress and its consequences, further research is needed to definitively determine its effectiveness in treating burnout. 
","Of the psychotherapy modalities, only Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) has evidence of potential efficacy for burnout. For other forms of psychotherapy, the scientific evidence is unclear or non-existent."
Is electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) in combination with ordinary fitness training more efficient than fitness training alone?,"['However, according to a meta-analysis summarising the results of 17 studies, the effect is no greater than in conventional strengthening exercises [ 1 ].', 'Full-body EMS as a fitness method hardly investigated While the electrical stimulation of individual muscle groups for therapeutic purposes was investigated by some research groups, there are hardly any scientific studies on the whole-body EMS as a fitness training replacement.']",1,"While some research exists on the electrical stimulation of individual muscles, there is limited scientific evidence on the effectiveness of full-body EMS as a fitness training replacement.  
","There is evidence for the principle effectiveness of EMS for muscle strengthening. For a superiority of the combination of EMS and ordinary training compared to fitness training alone, the evidence is contradictory."
Can vitamin and nutrient supplements prevent the eye disease age-related macular degeneration?,"['Progress probably slows down In fact, the summarized results of previously published studies show that a combination of vitamin C, E, beta-carotene and zinc can probably maintain the increasingly deteriorating vision longer.', 'However, the fact that a vitamin mix seems to slow the progression of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is largely due to the results of a single study conducted by the US ""AREDS"" research team [1] [3].', 'This study examined a mixture of 500 mg vitamin C, 400 IU vitamin E, 15 mg beta-carotene, 80 mg zinc oxide and 2 mg copper oxide.', 'It is well established that vitamin E and beta-carotene are not suitable for prevention â€“ they cannot prevent the ocular disease from developing in old age.']",2,"While some studies suggest a vitamin and nutrient combination might slow the progression of age-related macular degeneration, other evidence indicates that certain components, like vitamin E and beta-carotene, are not effective for prevention. 
","Vitamin E and beta-carotene cannot prevent the development of age-related macular degeneration. However, in combination with zinc and vitamin C, they probably allow certain forms of an existing disease to progress somewhat more slowly."
Do milk or dairy products promote colon cancer and rectal cancer?,"['For ovarian cancer, breast cancer and cancer of the uterine mucosa, the authors of extensive systematic reviews have so far found no evidence of a reduction in risk or an increase in risk [3] [4] [5].', 'However, the study situation is still too unclear to draw definitive conclusions, which requires more and more meaningful studies.', 'There is also the possibility that dairy products will reduce the likelihood of bladder cancer.']",2,"The provided sentences discuss the potential effects of dairy products on various cancers but do not offer specific information about colon or rectal cancer.  
","It is likely that dairy products reduce the risk of colon and rectal cancer, and possibly bladder cancer. However, very large amounts of milk & dairy products could possibly increase the risk of prostate cancer. It should be remembered that about the same number of men die from colon and rectal cancer as from prostate cancer. For breast and ovarian cancer and cancer of the endometrium, it is unclear whether cancer risk is affected by milk and dairy products."
Which of the three most common laser eye surgeries produces the best results and has the fewest side effects?,"['However, the study situation is still rather thin, new and large studies could still change somewhat in this assessment.', 'At present, all three methods lead to very good results, which, according to the first long-term studies [3], are likely to be sustainable.', 'Results from a few years ago are no longer meaningful today because the treatment method has changed.', 'Long-term studies therefore always refer to the state of the art at that time, but already suggest that laser treatments are safe and sustainable [1] [2] [3].']",0,"While long-term studies suggest laser eye surgeries are safe and effective, the field is still evolving and new research may change current assessments.  
","If only new studies are considered, all three techniques are equally successful. Probable advantages of LASIK: less pain after surgery and good vision more quickly."
Does the drug fingolimod reduce the progression of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis similarly or better than previous drugs?,"['The recently newly approved active substance Fingolimod in Europe causes white blood cells (T cells) to be held back in the lymph nodes, which prevents them from causing inflammation by immigrating to the brain.', 'By means of systematic literature research, we wanted to find out whether fingolimod is similar to or better than previous multiple sclerosis â€“ drugs can inhibit the progression of the disease.']",0,"The provided sentences discuss fingolimod's mechanism of action and the research conducted to assess its effectiveness in inhibiting disease progression, but they do not directly compare it to previous multiple sclerosis drugs.  
","Two manufacturer-funded clinical trials attest Fingolimod such efficacy that exceeds that of interferon beta therapy. However, the drug can also cause serious side effects."
Can cancer be successfully fought with intentionally induced fever?,"['==References== In the 19th century, the idea was born that fevers protect against cancer.', 'No major modern studies have been conducted in which deliberately triggered fever has been tested as therapy.']",1,"While historical beliefs suggest a link between fever and cancer protection, modern research lacks studies examining the therapeutic effects of intentionally induced fever for cancer treatment.  
","In the early 20th century, cancer was indeed sometimes fought with fever, sometimes successfully. But the therapies and trials are poorly documented and were risky. An assessment of efficacy is not possible based on the studies to date."

","Electro-ear acupuncture could be supportive against chronic pain such as neck or low back pain. The method cannot completely replace painkillers. For surgery-related pain, the effectiveness is uncertain."
Does treatment with the new drug erenumab reduce the number of migraine days per month?,"['In other words, compared to a sham medication, individuals with episodic migraines were spared on average 1 to 2 migraine days per month by erenumab [1-4].', 'So far no serious side effects The side effects of erenumab â€“ as far as the earlier rather shorter studies at least â€“ do not seem to be serious: those who used erenumab complained a little more frequently than those with the dummy medication about injection site reactions, constipation, muscle cramps and itching [6].', 'Because erenumab has so far only been compared with placebo.', 'No long-term data The results on efficacy and safety first sound as if people with a similar condition as in the studies could actually benefit from erenumab.']",0,"The provided sentences discuss the potential benefits of erenumab in reducing migraine days but acknowledge that long-term data and comparisons with other treatments are limited.  
","In five studies available to date, which tend to be shorter, participants suffered from migraine less frequently with erenumab than with a placebo. The studies were of high methodological quality. In episodic migraine, people ""saved"" about 1 to 2 migraine days per month . For chronic migraine, sufferers had about 2.5 fewer days of pain per month. However, the efficacy and safety data relate to a maximum time frame of six months; the long-term benefit still needs to be explored. The benefit of erenumab compared to other established preventive migraine drugs has also not yet been researched."
Do saw palmetto preparations help with benign prostate enlargement?,"['[4] [7] A well substantiated statement can only be made for saw palm preparations: A data analysis published in 2012 shows that these remedies do not work better than placebos and are therefore ineffective.', 'However, it might be useful to continue to follow certain indications of symptom-improving plants and to compare them with new studies â€“ at least in older studies, extracts of the African plum tree, willow grass pollen and the plant ingredient beta-sitosterin were considered safe and possibly effective.', '[updated and supplemented on March 1, 2015 with details on saw palm extracts, beta sitosterol, extracts of the African plum tree and willow grass pollen extract] ( Author: J.
