Can masks reduce corona infections when worn by a large proportion of the population?,"['Studies show slow spread After three years of pandemic, there are now relatively meaningful data that masks can slow down the spread of the Corona virus.', 'Surgical masks, in turn, seem to reduce the risk of infecting themselves with the corona virus.']",0,"The first sentence provides evidence that masks can slow down the spread of the Corona virus, supporting the claim that masks can reduce corona infections when worn by a large proportion of the population.","International studies suggest that the number of corona infections decreases when many people wear masks - whether fabric, surgical or FFP2 masks. However, it is not possible to precisely quantify how great the protective effect actually is. It probably depends on the type of masks and the proportion of people who wear them."
Can homeopathic preparations with Anamirta cocculus help against dizziness?,"['But without success: We could not find any meaningful scientific evidence for effectiveness in dizziness.', 'It is now well proven by studies that homeopathic preparations usually do not work better than a sham medication (placebo) [8].', 'However, it is not well established that betahistine is effective against dizziness [11.13].', 'The fact that betahist helps with dizziness is not well documented [11, 13].']",1,"The claim of homeopathic preparations with Anamirta cocculus helping against dizziness is not supported as there is no meaningful scientific evidence of their effectiveness, and they typically do not work better than a placebo.","We have found only one study that has investigated this. However, it is so poor that no reliable statement is possible."
Can zeolite alleviate or prevent health problems?,"['However, none of these can provide any evidence – because the studies have no significance (for reasons see section Studies in detail ).', 'It does not find an advantage for zeolite – but the results are hardly meaningful.', 'However, it is not researched whether the regular intake of zeolite can lead to a nutrient deficiency or has an undesirable effect on digestion.']",1,"The claim that zeolite can alleviate or prevent health problems is not supported by the provided sentences, as there is no significant evidence found in studies and no research on potential nutrient deficiencies or digestive effects due to regular zeolite intake.",Studies to date cannot provide any evidence that taking zeolite prevents or alleviates complaints. A detoxifying effect is not scientifically plausible.
Does paxlovid protect unvaccinated people with risk factors from severe or even fatal covid 19 disease?,"['Patients at risk without corona vaccination appear to be well protected from serious to fatal events by Paxlovid.', 'However, it is not certain how well Paxlovid helps people who have already received corona vaccination.', 'In addition, the scientists investigated whether Paxlovid alleviated the Covid-19 symptoms, shortened the duration of the disease and reduced the need for medical treatment: Half of the participants improved the symptoms with Paxlovid after 13 days, with placebo after 15 days.', 'With Paxlovid, 14 out of 1000 participants needed medical treatment for Covid-19 within a month, with placebo 76 out of 1000.', 'Whether with or without antibodies in the blood, Paxlovid basically protected all humans from a severe course.']",0,"While the sentences suggest that Paxlovid offers protection from severe or fatal Covid-19 for those with or without antibodies, they do not explicitly state whether this protection applies only to unvaccinated individuals with risk factors, leaving uncertainty regarding the claim.","In a large, well-done study, paxlovid prevented hospitalizations and deaths in high-risk patients. They were unvaccinated and had contracted the delta variant. For vaccinated people, the benefit cannot be reliably estimated. This also applies to people with immunodeficiency."
"Does starting school later improve health, learning success, and quality of life in adolescents?","['However, teenagers and parents now have to be very strong: despite 27 studies involving hundreds of thousands of students, no clear results can be derived from research.', 'The problem: The studies usually come to contradictory results.', 'So until better research results are available, all troubled young people and parents will only have the option of remaining out of bed early – or to hope that, despite lack of evidence, the school management will still have an insight into it.', 'It is difficult to examine whether a later start to school will have a positive effect.', 'The Problems: Unknown Influencing Factors: If differences occur in previous-after-studies, these do not have to be due to the later start of school – they may also have been caused by other changes over the course of the study period.']",1,The claim cannot be definitively supported or refuted due to contradictory results from existing studies and the presence of unknown influencing factors.,"The question has been investigated in several large studies. Due to methodological deficiencies and contradictory results, no firm conclusions can be drawn. This means that science can currently neither speak for nor against a benefit of a later school start."
Does the F.X. Mayr cure have health benefits? Can it prevent diseases or treat them?,"['Thus, the claim that the method can help with various diseases is not scientifically justified.', 'These studies cannot answer whether these changes also affect health.', 'Mayr cure or other fasting methods improve health in the long term, however, cannot be concluded.']",1,"The provided sentences offer no scientific evidence to support the claim that the F.X. Mayr cure has health benefits, prevents diseases, or treats them, and they suggest that the long-term health effects of fasting methods like the Mayr cure are inconclusive.","It is neither examined nor proven whether the special fasting method after F.X. Mayr holds, which it promises: Namely assistance with all possible illnesses of allergies, over rheumatism up to sleep disturbances. The advertised detoxification and ""purification"" of the body by the chamfering cure are besides scientifically not plausible."
Does the consumption of soy foods or soy isoflavones affect the appearance of acne skin?,"['In both cases, certain soya ingredients are responsible for the effect on the skin: the isoflavones.', 'There are two competing theories that contradict each other: according to the first theory, isoflavones confuse the hormone balance and are supposed to promote acne in this way.', 'Surprisingly, despite searching in two large databases, we could not find a study on soy products and acne – whether soy milk, soy sauce or tofu.', 'The isoflavones improved the skin appearance more than an anti-acne cream with vitamin A acid (Tretinoin).', 'Conclusion: There is currently no evidence from reliable studies that soy makes acne worse.']",1,"While there are theories suggesting isoflavones in soy products can disrupt hormone balance and potentially promote acne, a thorough search of two large databases revealed no studies directly examining the relationship between soy and acne, making it difficult to definitively support or refute the claim.","We could not find any meaningful studies at all on the influence of soy foods on acne. On soy isoflavones, we found two small studies of questionable quality that examined a very specific group of sufferers. Soy isoflavones improved the skin appearance somewhat. However, this result is not reliable."
Does extract from the Damiana plant (Turnera diffusa) help with erectile dysfunction?,"['Efficacy does not appear to have been studied or demonstrated.', 'The studies in detail We could not find any studies on Damiana extract against erectile dysfunction in men.', 'Studies on the product Neradin also appear to be missing.']",1,"The claim cannot be supported since there are no studies demonstrating the efficacy of Damiana extract for erectile dysfunction in men, and studies on the related product Neradin are also missing.","The extract from the Damiana plant (Turnera diffusa) is advertised as a remedy for erectile dysfunction for men. However, this claimed effect on potency is by no means proven. It has apparently never been tested on humans. This also applies to homeopathic remedies such as the product Neradin."
Is the homeopathic remedy Neradin effective for erectile dysfunction?,"['No studies on Neradin Also our search for studies on the product Neradin remained resultless.', 'Studies on the product Neradin also appear to be missing.']",1,"The claim cannot be supported because no studies on the effectiveness of Neradin for erectile dysfunction were found, and its impact remains unproven by available research.","The extract from the Damiana plant (Turnera diffusa) is advertised as a remedy for erectile dysfunction for men. However, this claimed effect on potency is by no means proven. It has apparently never been tested on humans. This also applies to homeopathic remedies such as the product Neradin."
Does regular HPV testing in addition to the recommended Pap smear detect more precancerous lesions than just the Pap smear alone?,"['According to the studies, the HPV test is likely to detect slightly more precursors of cervical cancer over several years than the PAP swab alone.', 'We are therefore relatively sure that with an additional HPV test at least a little more precursors of uterine cancer are detected than only with the PAP swab alone.']",0,"The studies indicate that HPV testing detects marginally more precancerous cervical lesions over time compared to Pap smears alone, providing evidence for the claim.","Regular examination of the cervix by means of PAP smear tests detects precancerous stages of the cervix in most cases in good time. This reduces the risk of developing cervical cancer. An additional HPV test every three to five years can make screening even more reliable. However, the difference should not be too great."
Can olive leaf extract reduce high blood pressure?,"['These studies therefore do not indicate whether olive leaf extract can help with significantly increased blood pressure.', 'Without success, however, we could not find any studies that investigated the effect of olive leaf extract on cardiovascular health.', 'However, they cannot provide clear answers.', 'It is therefore impossible to say whether olive leaves extract could have a better or worse effect with significantly increased blood pressure.']",1,"The studies referenced do not provide clear evidence indicating whether olive leaf extract can help reduce high blood pressure, as no studies investigating its effect on cardiovascular health were found to be successful.","Whether olive leaf extract lowers blood pressure has been investigated in five suitable studies to date. They all found no effect or only a slight effect of the extract. The problem with this is that most of the study participants had only slightly elevated blood pressure. They cannot answer how olive leaf extract works in people with significantly elevated blood pressure (hypertension). The studies also had gross flaws, few participants, and ran for a very short time. They cannot provide reliable answers."
Do green-lipped mussel preparations improve the symptoms of osteoarthritis?,"['Studies overall not meaningful The conclusion of our research: Scientific evidence for the claimed effect is missing.', 'It is also unclear whether the measured positive effects are large enough to actually be felt by those affected.', 'Whether or not green-lipped mussel helps with osteoarthritis cannot be said at the moment.', 'However, as early as 2009, the European Food Safety Authority considered that a protective effect of the green-lipped mussel on healthy joints has not been established.', 'In our opinion, no reliable conclusions can be drawn from the studies found.']",1,"The claim that green-lipped mussel preparations improve the symptoms of osteoarthritis is not supported by the research, which finds no scientific evidence for the claimed effect and considers the measured positive effects too small to be perceptible by those affected.","The question was examined in four small studies with serious methodological deficiencies, which also arrived at partly contradictory results. No clear conclusions can be drawn from them. The claim that green-lipped mussel helps with osteoarthritis is not scientifically proven."
Can probiotics lower blood sugar in type 2 diabetes?,"['And if so, can probiotics reverse this change and reduce blood sugar levels again?', 'At the most small effect, they may actually be able to.', 'However, the effect of the capsules and tablets does not seem to be large: in the previous studies, they were able to reduce the long-term sugar level HbA1c by an average of 0.55 points.']",0,"While some studies suggest probiotics may have a small effect in reducing HbA1c levels by an average of 0.55 points in type 2 diabetes, the impact of capsules and tablets does not seem to be large.","The summarized results of studies to date suggest that probiotics in capsule or tablet form could lower blood sugar somewhat. At least if they are taken over a period of two to three months. However, the effect is not well established. Probiotic dairy products and probiotic powder for dissolving do not seem to have any demonstrable effect."
Can the so-called Tupler technique help against rectus diastasis?,"['No studies on the Tupler technique As intense as we were looking for, we could not find the promised studies on the Tupler technique.', 'The claim that this is a scientifically proven therapy for rectus diastase is therefore simply wrong.', 'The studies in detail We did not find any studies that investigated the effectiveness of the Tupler technique for the treatment of rectus diastase.']",1,"The claim that the Tupler technique is a scientifically proven therapy for rectus diastasis is incorrect, as no studies investigating its effectiveness for this condition were found.",We could not find a single study that examined whether the Tupler technique actually works. And this despite the fact that providers of the method advertise that its effectiveness is scientifically proven.
Can laser irradiation of blood by infusion needle (hemolaser treatment) relieve discomfort or help with diseases?,"['It is also unclear by what mechanism blood irradiation with bundled red light – i.e.', 'red laser – should improve health.', 'Although the authors of the three studies found [1-3] claim to have established a clear efficacy of haemolaser treatment, none of the three studies is suitable to prove this.']",1,"The three studies on hemolaser treatment lack the necessary rigor to establish its claimed efficacy in improving health, and the mechanism by which red laser irradiation of blood improves health remains unclear.",There is no scientific evidence that hemolaser treatment has a palliative or curative effect on health problems.
"In everyday life, when breathing with an FFP2 mask or ordinary mouth-nose protection, do you get as much oxygen as without a mask?","['As much oxygen as without a mask This fear is, however, unfounded, as previously conducted studies show [ 1,2 ].', 'Only in very strenuous sports (fast cycling to exhaustion) was the oxygen content in the blood with FFP2 mask slightly lower than without mask.', 'There was no difference in oxygen measurement with ordinary oral nose protection.', 'Breathing a little more strenuous The results thus contradict the rumor that masks would cause an oxygen deficiency.']",0,"The claim is supported by the sentences provided, as previous studies indicate no significant difference in oxygen intake when wearing an FFP2 mask or ordinary mouth-nose protection in everyday life, except for very strenuous sports with the FFP2 mask.","Even if breathing with a mask can feel uncomfortable: According to studies to date, you get just as much oxygen with an FFP2 mask or mouth-nose protection as without a mask. This is true even when you are moving or exerting yourself. Only very intensive sports slightly reduce the oxygen content in the blood - but too little to endanger health."
Can CBD help with period pain?,"['Because despite searching in three different databases we could not find a single study on CBD in case of regular pain.', 'Scientifically, it is not sufficiently researched whether CBD actually promotes sleep, as providers claim.', 'The studies in detail We could not find any studies that investigated whether CBD can help with normal pain – neither for treatment nor for prevention.']",1,"The sentences provide no evidence specifically regarding CBD's effect on period pain, as no studies were found to support this claim.",Whether CBD can relieve menstrual pain has apparently never been scientifically studied. We could not find any studies on this. Women who suffer from severe period pain should talk to a gynecologist about it. Diseases such as endometriosis could be behind it.
"Can a bioresonance device like ""Bioscan"" or ""Vieva Vital Analyser"" measure mineral and vitamin deficiencies or detect health problems?","['This experiment clearly shows that the devices studied are completely unsuitable to diagnose a lack of vitamins or minerals.', 'Sentenced for fraud at the end of May 2022, a German court also concluded that the Bioscan device cannot fulfil the claimed claims.', 'Claims for comparable products are equally implausible.', 'Even if 1000 subjects had participated in the study and only five to six people had shown such unreliable readings, such a device would be worthless for diagnostics.']",2,"The sentences provide evidence that Bioscan and similar devices cannot accurately measure mineral and vitamin deficiencies or detect health problems, as concluded by a German court and demonstrated in an experiment.","An experiment shows that the devices cannot distinguish between healthy people, seriously ill people and a corpse. The claimed mode of action behind the measurement method is also scientifically implausible. A German court has convicted the manufacturers of the Bioscan device (not legally binding) of fraud."
Does arthroscopy (joint endoscopy) help with osteoarthritis of the knee joint?,"['What might sound logical, however, has a catch: the arthroscopy of osteoarthritis does nothing to the treated person.', 'Studies clearly speak against a benefit A research team summarized the most meaningful of all previously published studies on arthroscopy in knee arthritis.', 'In these studies, patients treated after arthroscopy had no noticeably less pain or movement restrictions than those treated only for appearance or not at all.', 'Arthroscopy against osteoarthritis: not effective, but also not very risky After all: Undesirable events were not conspicuously common in the arthroscopy groups either.']",2,"The claim that arthroscopy helps with osteoarthritis of the knee joint is refuted by several studies indicating no significant reduction in pain or movement restrictions for patients who undergo the procedure, compared to those who receive no treatment or placebo treatment.",The data are clear: Arthroscopy is useless as a treatment for knee osteoarthritis. It can neither relieve pain nor improve the function of the knee joint in the long term.
"Do dietary supplements containing silicon (e.g. as ""organic silicon"" or silica) have health benefits?","['So far it is also completely unclear what role the element silicon plays in the human body at all [8].', 'We have researched: Previous studies do not provide any evidence that dietary supplements with silicon support bone build-up and thus protect older women from osteoporosis and bone fractures in old age [1,2].', 'There is no evidence that silicon improves the hair structure [3,4], strengthens the fingernails [4] or makes the skin more beautiful and elastic [4,6,7].', 'Also that silicon supports the formation of collagen and connective tissue is only a conjecture [8].', 'Conjectures without studies Neither we nor the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) [8] were able to find clinical studies on any other alleged health benefits of silicon.']",1,"The role of silicon in the human body is unclear, and no studies provide evidence that dietary supplements with silicon support bone build-up, improve hair structure, strengthen fingernails, make the skin more beautiful, or support collagen and connective tissue formation.","There is no evidence so far that the additional intake of silicon can promote health. Also that it strengthens nails, skin and hair is an unsubstantiated claim. Moreover, it is unclear whether silicon plays any role at all in the body."
Can regular intake of cranberry juice or cranberry extract prevent recurrent cystitis in women?,"['The summarized results show that the regular intake of cranberry products could have a preventive effect.', 'There is also only evidence that cranberry products can prevent bladder inflammation for otherwise healthy women.', 'Overall, there is evidence of a possible preventive effect of cranberry.']",0,"The summarized results indicate that cranberry products may prevent bladder inflammation for generally healthy women, but the evidence does not clearly support a preventive effect against recurrent cystitis in all women.","Women who repeatedly have to deal with bladder infections might become ill somewhat less frequently if they regularly take cranberry juice or extract. However, this is not well established. And it only applies to uncomplicated bladder infections in otherwise healthy women. Whether cranberry products help when cystitis is already present remains unclear. This has not yet been investigated in meaningful studies."
Will women who have recurrent bladder infections get rid of them faster if they take cranberry products only after the disease is already there???,"['There is also only evidence that cranberry products can prevent bladder inflammation for otherwise healthy women.', 'However, there does not seem to be any meaningful studies that have investigated this in women with recurrent bladder inflammation.', 'The preventive effect of cranberry in children, men and people with urinary catheters or certain diseases has not been studied.']",1,"The claim cannot be supported or refuted because there is no meaningful study that has investigated the effect of cranberry products on women with recurrent bladder infections, as stated in the sentences.","Women who repeatedly have to deal with bladder infections might become ill somewhat less frequently if they regularly take cranberry juice or extract.

Can extract from St. John's wort relieve the symptoms of depression? Is it similarly effective as drugs against depression (antidepressants)?,"[""St John's wort: effective in mild to moderate depression Probably yes."", ""In mild to moderate depression, St John's wort preparations probably work better than placebo."", ""St John's wort preparations are probably as good as antidepressants."", ""St. John's wort and antidepressants can relieve the discomfort, but the depression can probably not cure for good.""]",0,"The claim is supported by the sentences stating that St. John's wort is likely effective in mild to moderate depression, works better than a placebo, and is as good as antidepressants, although it may not cure depression permanently.",St. John's wort is likely to relieve the symptoms of mild to moderate depression better than a placebo. It also appears to be similarly effective to approved medications for depression (antidepressants). St. John's wort preparations are generally better tolerated than antidepressants.
"Does the Zisano bracelet strengthen the immune system, increase endurance and performance or reduce fatigue?","['Whether such bracelets have an effect, for example whether they can actually increase physical performance or strengthen the immune system, has apparently never been investigated.', 'Bracelets for more performance: studies show ineffectiveness All five studies came to the same conclusion: the bracelets had no effect on the performance or well-being of the subjects.', 'A scientifically plausible explanation as to how exactly such bracelets should develop their effect remains to be found in their suppliers.', 'The studies in detail We could not find any studies on the Zisano bracelet or comparable bracelets with silicon chip.']",1,"The claim that the Zisano bracelet strengthens the immune system, increases endurance and performance, or reduces fatigue is not supported by the provided sentences, as there is no scientific evidence found regarding the effectiveness of the Zisano bracelet or similar bracelets with a silicon chip.","The promised positive effects of the ""Powerband"" wristband on health and well-being have apparently not been scientifically studied. We could not find any studies on this. It is also unclear how the wristband is supposed to work in concrete terms. A scientifically plausible explanation is missing."
"Does microimmunotherapy improve symptoms of allergies, cancer, joint inflammation, autoimmune diseases, dementia or various viral infections?","['None of these studies are meaningful – because they are poorly carried out and the published data are incomplete.', 'They cannot give any indication of the benefits of microimmune therapy.', 'Entitled doubts Since microimmune therapy preparations are highly diluted as homeopathic agents, we have fundamental doubts about the method.']",1,"The claim cannot be supported as the provided sentences express doubts about the method of microimmunotherapy due to its high dilution, similar to homeopathic agents, and question the validity of studies due to incomplete data and poor execution.","So far, studies seem to exist only on microimmunotherapy against hay fever and cancer. Their significance is far too low to conclude that the therapy is effective. We found no studies on other health problems. Thus, there is no proven benefit of microimmunotherapy for any disease."
Does pine wood improve sleep?,"['So there is no indication that the pine wood improves sleep.', 'The importance of these laboratory measurements for the sleep of the participants is unclear – even if the researchers interpret them as positive effects of the circling bed.', 'Whether a pine bed actually improves sleep would have to study more rigorous studies carried out according to scientific criteria on significantly more subjects in the future.The studies in detail [1,2] Grote et al.']",1,"While some studies suggest positive effects of pine wood on sleep quality, the first sentence directly refutes the claim that pine wood improves sleep, stating there is no indication of such an effect.","So far, only one small study has investigated this question. However, the results of this study are not conclusive due to numerous deficiencies in the conduct of the study."
Do spermidine supplements or a spermidine-rich diet reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia? Do they help with existing dementia?,"['Spermidin studies: not enough as evidence of efficacy Even if both studies had come to overwhelmingly positive results, we would still have concerns about their significance.', 'Spermidine, which is additionally absorbed by food, is not sufficiently researched at the present time.', 'The number of participants is low and the risk is high that the results are not transferable to reality.', 'We do not consider the study to be meaningful.', 'Results: Both the spermidine group and the comparator group had fewer dementia symptoms and better mental performance at the end of the study.']",1,"The claim cannot be supported by the provided sentences, as the studies on spermidine's effects on dementia symptoms have low participant numbers and their results may not be representative of real-world scenarios, while spermidine's role in dementia risk reduction remains insufficiently researched.","Manufacturers of spermidine drugs advertise an alleged positive effect on mental performance and protection against dementia. However, such an effect has not been proven in meaningful studies. We found a single study in which dementia patients had participated. However, their results are not very clear."
Does covid vaccination reduce the likelihood of getting long-lasting symptoms (long covid) in case of corona infection?,"['Long-Covid risk with low vaccination Two studies [1,2] suggest that the long-covid risk is likely to be lower if vaccinated twice: In one of these studies with Corona infected [1], twice vaccinated patients reported 40 to 50 percent less likely to be affected by Long Covid compared to non-vaccinated patients.', 'Results Two-fold Vaccinated people reported to be affected by long-covid symptoms only about half as often as non-vaccinated people.']",0,"Twice vaccinated individuals report being affected by long-covid symptoms roughly half as often as non-vaccinated individuals, suggesting a lower risk of long-lasting symptoms with vaccination.","If twice-vaccinated people are infected, their risk of later being affected by Long Covid may be only half that of non-vaccinated people.

Do sedatives and sleeping pills such as benzodiazepines and related substances increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease or other forms of dementia?,"['However, it cannot be clearly dispelled by the fact that benzodiazepines and similar substances could promote the development of dementia.']",1,"The sentence suggests a correlation between benzodiazepines and dementia, but it does not provide sufficient evidence to confirm a causative relationship between the two.","A link between the long-term use of sedatives and sleeping pills and the development of dementia cannot be ruled out. However, whether the drugs are the cause of dementia is unclear. Likewise, it is possible that studies show a connection only because people in the undiagnosed early stages of dementia suffer more frequently from sleep disorders or restlessness and therefore take medication against them more often."
Do infusions of vitamin C relieve symptoms of chronic fatigue or long covid?,"['It is also unclear whether people with Long Covid benefit from vitamin C infusions.', 'One of the two authors is also an employee of a pharmaceutical company that also offers products with vitamin C.  Since the developmental mechanisms of both chronic fatigue syndrome and long covid are unclear, studies with cancer patients or healthy participants cannot provide answers to the question whether vitamin C can help people with chronic fatigue syndrome or long covid.']",1,"While some studies suggest that vitamin C can have health benefits, there is no clear evidence or understanding of the developmental mechanisms of chronic fatigue syndrome and long covid to conclude that vitamin C infusions can relieve symptoms of these conditions, especially considering potential biases from pharmaceutical company ties.",Whether vitamin C infusions help with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is questionable. This has not yet been scientifically investigated. We also could not find a single study on vitamin C and fatigue occurring in the context of Long Covid.
Does taking probiotics shorten the duration of acute infectious diarrhea?,"['Thus, at least in children, taking live probiotics is unlikely to affect whether they are still ill after 48 hours.', 'Thus, a probiotic apparently has no clear influence on the resolution of the disease.']",2,"The sentences indicate that probiotics do not have a clear influence on resolving acute infectious diarrhea, which contradicts the claim that probiotics can shorten its duration.","According to current studies, the duration of disease cannot be reduced by taking probiotics. This assessment is reasonably well supported."
Does high-dose vitamin D slow down the course of disease in multiple sclerosis (MS)?,"['However, such observations alone are not sufficient to actually demonstrate the benefit of highly dosed vitamin D in MS.   Studies on vitamin D in MS We have therefore been looking for meaningful studies on the high-dose treatment of vitamin D in multiple sclerosis.', 'At present, we cannot say for sure whether highly dosed vitamin D actually brings benefits to MS.', 'However, the data so far suggest that an effect, if any, would be rather small.']",1,"The data so far suggests that any potential effect of high-dose vitamin D on MS would be small, and there is no definitive evidence of significant benefits.","We can neither clearly exclude nor confirm that there is an effect. In a total of 15 studies, no benefit could be demonstrated for high-dose vitamin D in adults with multiple sclerosis. Because the studies had many weaknesses, we cannot draw any conclusions about positive or negative effects."
Does taking taiga root extract strengthen the immune system? Can it make vaccinations more effective or tolerable?,"['Taiga Root and Immune Defense: Extensive Studies Missing In our extensive research, we have not found any studies that can demonstrate an immune-strengthening effect of the Taiga Root.', 'However, the studies were too small and inadequate for reliable results.', 'Whether the taiga root is beneficial to the immune defense can not be proven at the present time – but also cannot be ruled out.', 'The two available studies also do not provide any information on whether taiga root extract could even make vaccinations more effective.']",1,"The claim that taiga root extract strengthens the immune system and makes vaccinations more effective or tolerable cannot be supported or refuted due to insufficient and inconclusive studies, as stated in the sentences.",The alleged immune-strengthening effect of taiga root (also called Siberian ginseng) has apparently never been investigated in appropriate studies. The positive effect claimed by dietary supplement manufacturers after vaccinations is also not proven.
Does short-term fasting improve quality of life in cancer?,"['On this basis, we cannot reliably say whether fasting during chemotherapy is actually useful or not, thus reducing side effects and improving the quality of life.', 'In terms of quality of life, there are already contradictions within the individual studies: in the study [1b], in which the participants switched between fasting and non-fasting after half of the chemotherapy, only in one group did the quality of life improve during fasting, in the other the quality of life did not improve.', 'Whether this is actually noticeable for cancer patients remains questionable.']",1,"While some studies suggest that fasting during chemotherapy may improve quality of life in certain cases, other studies show contradictory results, making it questionable whether this effect is noticeable for cancer patients.",We found only three very small studies on both questions. Their results are so unreliable that we cannot make any assessment. So we cannot say whether the quality of life of those affected is improved and whether fasting during chemotherapy reduces side effects.
Does zinc preventively protect against covid-19 disease???,"['A preventive effect has not yet been researched in a single study.', 'It is therefore unclear whether the preventive use of zinc preparations protects against an infection with SARS-CoV-2 or a Covid-19 disease.']",1,"The claim that zinc prevents COVID-19 has not been researched in any study yet, leaving it unclear whether zinc preparations offer protective benefits against SARS-CoV-2 infection or Covid-19 disease.",The results of two studies on this suggest that sufferers with Covid-19 do not recover more quickly with zinc than without. A preventive effect has not yet been investigated in studies.
Do herbal remedies with nasturtium and horseradish alleviate the symptoms of cystitis as well as an antibiotic???,"['The antibiotic alleviated the discomfort faster than the product with capuchin cress and horseradish, after eight days there was no difference.', 'Therefore, the herbal agent is not likely to be a full substitute for an antibiotic.']",1,"The antibiotic alleviated cystitis symptoms faster than the herbal remedy containing nasturtium and horseradish, suggesting that herbal agents may not be a complete substitute for antibiotics in treating cystitis.","As for prevention, we have found only one small but somewhat reliable study.

Does mistletoe therapy help against cancer or can it improve the quality of life of cancer patients?,"['It is currently unclear whether cancer sufferers live longer or better due to mistletoe therapy.', 'No longer survival time detectable The analysis of the previously published survival studies [1] shows that overall mistletoe therapy does not seem to be able to prolong the lifetime of cancer patients.', 'In order to prove this, meaningful studies are still missing – even after about a hundred years.The studies in detail We looked for overviews in three different databases, which summarize the current study situation on mistletoe therapy in cancer.']",1,"While some studies suggest a slowing of Corona spread with mask usage, no clear evidence indicates mistletoe therapy improves cancer patients' survival or quality of life.","Mistletoe therapy for cancer has been investigated in some studies. However, these are very poor and come to inconsistent results. They cannot prove that mistletoe therapy is effective. In addition, there is a suspicion that mistletoe preparations may even stimulate tumor growth in some types of cancer."
Can homeopathic remedies prevent colds in children?,"['Benefits for prevention improbable The conclusion of the review work: Homeopathy is probably not an effective means of preventing colds in children.', 'Children who regularly took homeopathic medicines were not less likely to become ill in the meaningful studies and their colds were not milder.', 'Overall, the studies could not find a preventive effect of homeopathic medicines; they did not reduce the frequency or severity of cold diseases.']",2,The claim is refuted by the sentences as the studies found no preventive effect of homeopathic medicines in reducing the frequency or severity of cold diseases in children.,"Well-conducted studies find neither a preventive nor an alleviating effect of homeopathy on children's colds (chills). However, these studies have examined too few children for a truly conclusive result. Larger studies would be needed for a clear answer.  It is not scientifically plausible that homeopathic remedies are effective."
Do agents containing uridine and/or cytidine improve the symptoms of polyneuropathy?,"['Despite searching in three large databases, we have not been able to find any studies that met these criteria.', 'Whether drugs with uridine and/or cytidine actually help with polyneuropathia, we cannot estimate on this basis.']",1,The claim cannot be supported or refuted since there is no available evidence or studies found that investigate the effect of agents containing uridine and/or cytidine on polyneuropathy symptoms.,We have not been able to find any meaningful studies on this question.
Can regular exercise prevent you from getting a cold or other respiratory infections???,"['People who practice sports on a regular basis are likely to suffer as often from respiratory infections as sports muffles.', 'The studies suggest that although the number of infections can not be reduced by sport, it may be a little milder for the duration of the disease and for the duration of the disease as a whole.']",2,"While regular exercise doesn't reduce the frequency of respiratory infections, studies suggest it may slightly alleviate symptoms and shorten the duration of illness for those who practice sports.","Previous studies suggest that sports-playing people may be just as likely to have respiratory infections as sports-muffle people.

"Can the Wim Hof method - consisting of breathing training, meditation and acclimatization to cold - strengthen the immune system of healthy people and thus prevent infectious diseases?","['Cold without proven effect for health For none of these promises there is evidence.', 'The study also cannot answer whether trained people reacted less strongly to the bacterial poison than non-trained people – because they lack accurate data.', 'Even if the study had been carried out better, the extent to which this actually brings health benefits such as a reduced risk of infectious diseases is entirely speculative.', 'Even if it were better methodically, it could not answer whether it is the cold that does anything.', 'The cold records from Wim Hof are partly impressive, but whether cold training has a health benefit can not prove this study.']",1,"The study's data does not support the claim that cold training through the Wim Hof method strengthens the immune system and prevents infectious diseases, as it lacks accurate data on comparative reactions to bacterial toxins and cannot prove a health benefit from cold records.","There are individual small studies on the Wim Hof method, but they are poor and inconclusive. Whether the method reduces the probability of infectious diseases has never been researched."
Do saw palmetto preparations improve the symptoms of benign enlarged prostate (benign prostatic hyperplasia) in the longer term compared to placebo?,"['No better than placebo The two systematic overviews [1,2] come to the conclusion in the summary in agreement: The saw palm preparations do not relieve prostate problems better than a sham medication.', 'In other studies that tested saw palm as an addition to tamsulosin, the addition of saw palm did not bring any extra benefit.']",2,"The two systematic overviews and other studies consistently show that saw palmetto preparations do not alleviate prostate problems more effectively than a placebo, even when used in combination with tamsulosin.","According to current studies, remedies with saw palmetto do not improve the symptoms of a benign enlarged prostate in the longer term more than a placebo.

Is eating genetically modified corn a health concern?,"['Unexplored hazards for humans Whether genetically modified maize varieties can pose a potential health risk for humans is still little researched.', 'Little meaningful On closer examination, however, these abnormalities proved to be of little significance, since they could have occurred by chance.', 'In any case, there is no concrete evidence of a noticeable toxicity of genetically modified maize plants for humans in scientific literature – with a share of 70% of all maize plants grown in the USA.', '[6] Nevertheless, there are no investigations to exclude possible rare long-term effects in humans – after all, a human being differs significantly from a rat in several characteristics.']",1,"While the majority of maize grown in the USA is genetically modified and no significant toxicity has been found in scientific literature, there is still a lack of investigation to exclude possible rare long-term effects in humans, leaving potential health concerns unexplored.",Several feeding studies in rats over short periods of time provide no clear indications of a health concern for various genetically modified corn varieties Whether side effects may occur over a longer period of time cannot be answered due to the lack of conclusive long-term studies in humans.
Is a gluten-free diet recommended for people who do not have celiac disease?,"['Whether gluten itself does not actually cause digestive problems, if one does not suffer from celiac disease, has to be examined better in larger studies.', 'Hardly surprising, there are no solid long-term studies on healthy individuals on the risks of a gluten-free diet.', 'Currently, there are no convincing studies that argue for the absence of gluten by healthy people.', 'So we currently do not know whether a gluten-free diet has long-term advantages.', 'Overall, the studies conducted so far on gluten-free nutrition in people without celiac disease are not meaningful.']",1,"While there is no solid evidence indicating that a gluten-free diet has long-term advantages for those without celiac disease, there is also a lack of studies examining the potential risks of such a diet in healthy individuals.","There are no well-done studies that have investigated gluten abstinence in people who do not suffer from the autoimmune disease celiac disease. Therefore, there is a lack of reliable data on the possible benefits of a long-term gluten-free diet in the general population. Equally poorly studied are any risks of this form of renunciation, which is so hip at the moment."

Such an effect has not yet been studied in humans."
Does consumption of dairy products in middle and advanced age protect against bone fractures?,"['Milk and dairy products no protection against broken bones Healthy bones need calcium, and milk contains a lot of it.', 'But the consumption of calcium-rich dairy products alone is not enough for strong bones.', 'An analysis of all relevant studies up to 2010 speaks more clearly: The results indicate that dairy products have no influence on the probability of developing a fracture of the thigh neck at an age of over 40 years [1] A summary of those studies published until 2015 also comes to the same conclusion [1a].Nevertheless, it is still too early to provide clear evidence.', 'However, it also indicates that dairy products are ineffective in preventing bone fractures [2].', 'Effect at a young age unclear Whether the consumption of dairy products in youth can influence the probability of bone fractures in old age is not sufficiently investigated at present.']",2,"The analysis of studies up to 2010 and 2015 indicates that dairy product consumption does not influence the probability of thigh neck fractures in individuals over 40, refuting the claim that dairy products protect against bone fractures.",Those who are 40 or older and consume a lot of dairy products do not seem to be able to reduce their risk of age-related bone fractures.
Is the milk of horn-bearing cows less rich in allergens and more easily tolerated by lactose-intolerant individuals?,"['In the above-mentioned doctoral thesis, the comparison of proteins in the milk of cows with and without horns is based only on a few exemplary samples – far too little and too imprecise to come to a durable statement.', 'The author has not investigated whether milk-allergic persons actually react to one of the two types of milk with less complaints.', 'Also that the milk of horned cows is better tolerated for lactose-intolerant people, the data of the doctoral thesis in no way show.', 'In some respects, they are more stringent than bio-criteria, which are therefore exceeded in Demeter operations.']",1,"The claim that horn-bearing cow milk is less rich in allergens and more easily tolerated by lactose-intolerant individuals is not supported by the doctoral thesis, which only provides a limited comparison based on a few samples and does not investigate milk-allergic reactions or lactose intolerance.",There is no well-done study that would provide conclusive scientific evidence to support these questions.

Because there have been no studies on this coffee blend with human test subjects, we cannot make any reliable statements."
Does skipping breakfast increase heart attack risk?,"['Obviously, therefore, the main reason for the increased risk of heart attacks was not to skip the morning meal, but overweight, diabetes, increased blood pressure, or too high cholesterol levels.', 'Thus, it is unclear whether the omission of breakfast leads to overweight or excess weight leads to the omission of breakfast.']",1,"The claim that skipping breakfast increases heart attack risk is not directly supported by the sentences, as they suggest that other factors like overweight, diabetes, increased blood pressure, or high cholesterol levels are the main reasons for the increased risk.","There is no clear evidence that not eating breakfast could be a cause of obesity and, as a consequence, an increased risk of heart attack. It is possible, however, that it is primarily those people who are overweight and have a higher heart risk who forgo their morning meal."
Do whole grains lower the likelihood of dying early?,"['Against cancer, heart problems and diabetes The current study situation shows something else: Those who frequently resort to whole grains get less cancer or cardiovascular diseases, for example a heart attack [1–4].', 'Thus, people in whom whole grains play a major role in their daily diet seem to live longer and healthier.', 'All four summaries come to the same conclusion: They show a clear correlation between a full-grain diet and a reduced chance of dying early.', 'At least as far as the reduced risk of disease is concerned, the data show a robust dose-effect relationship: the more whole grains are eaten, the lower the risk of disease [6].']",0,"The sentences provide evidence that a diet rich in whole grains is associated with a reduced risk of disease and a potential increase in lifespan, but they do not directly address the likelihood of dying early.",People who eat whole grain products instead of foods made from refined flour are likely to live longer and probably have a lower risk of dying from cancer or cardiovascular disease.
Does regular consumption of energy drinks harm heart health?,"['Thus, energy drinks could potentially increase heart rate and blood pressure in the short term, but this is not the case in all studies.', 'However, the fact that the energy drinks had caused death is not certain.', 'There is no evidence that caffeine can cause cardiac arrhythmias or atrial fibrillation at moderate doses.', 'Larger doses of energy drinks can cause, for example, heart turf, tremor, arousal and digestive problems.']",1,"While some studies suggest energy drinks may transiently increase heart rate and blood pressure, there is insufficient evidence to confirm they cause harm to heart health, and caffeine at moderate doses does not lead to cardiac arrhythmias or atrial fibrillation.",This question is insufficiently researched. Larger studies over a longer period of time are needed to assess the heart risk from energy drinks.
Do light drinks promote obesity?,"['However, the fact that sweeteners actually affect blood sugar and insulin levels has not been proven.', 'The largest work, a summary analysis of three studies involving a total of 125,000 participants [7], comes to the opposite conclusion – light drinks should therefore reduce the weight slightly.', 'No scientific evidence whether artificially sweetened lemonades promote the development of overweight is therefore not yet available.']",1,"While a summary analysis of three studies involving 125,000 participants suggests that light drinks might slightly reduce weight, there is no concrete scientific evidence proving that artificially sweetened lemonades promote overweight development.","Several cohort studies show that people who frequently drink light drinks are more likely to be overweight.

It is unclear where this effect comes from and whether other caffeinated beverages might also be protective.
Does sugar consumption increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes regardless of obesity?,"['Soft drinks increase the risk of diabetes People with a preference for large amounts of sugar-containing sodas also suffer more frequently from diabetes.', 'In their analyses, two research teams [1,2] were able to independently show that the more sugar the study participants consume in the form of soft drinks, the higher the probability of developing type 2 diabetes.', 'It seems that daily consumption of sugared soft drinks can trigger diabetes over many years even if it does not make you fat.', 'Sugar content of other foods with unclear influence The association with type 2 diabetes is relatively clear for soft drinks.']",0,"The sentences provide evidence that soft drink sugar consumption increases type 2 diabetes risk, regardless of obesity, as higher soft drink sugar intake is associated with a higher probability of diabetes.","Sugar-containing soft drinks can - if consumed regularly - cause obesity. Obesity, in turn, increases the likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes. However, sugared soft drinks probably also increase the risk of diabetes independently of obesity."
Is less eaten from red plates?,"['The result: The test subjects who were served their pretzels on red plates accessed significantly less than participants with blue or white plates.', 'In a second experiment, subjects also drank soft drinks in a larger amount of blue instead of red cups.', 'As logical as this explanation may sound, the study does not yet provide scientific evidence that red plates really eat less.', 'In both salty and sweet snacks, the participants gained less when they were lying on a red plate in front of them.']",0,"The study's findings indicate that test subjects consumed fewer salty and sweet snacks from red plates compared to blue or white plates, but the evidence does not conclusively prove that red plates cause a reduction in food consumption.","In two psychological experiments, participants were less likely to eat salty pretzels, popcorn or chocolate chips if they were served on red plates. It is unclear whether the effect lasts over a longer period of time."
Does breastfeeding reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome?,"['The scientists conclude that the risk of breastfed children is halved compared to un breastfed children [2].', 'However, the matter has a small catch: the studies analysed show a connection.', 'The studies in detail The fact that breastfeeding reduces the risk of unexpected death of a baby is only moderately secure.', 'However, this does not necessarily prove that breastfeeding is the reason for the lower risk of infant death.']",0,"While studies suggest a connection between breastfeeding and a lower risk of sudden infant death syndrome, they do not definitively prove that breastfeeding is the cause of this reduced risk.","Breastfeeding can possibly reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome, but this is not entirely certain.

Can glutamate in food cause intolerance symptoms?,"['There are many case reports of an alleged glutamate hypersensitivity, but these can hardly be verified.', 'But among the alleged glutamate-sensitive subjects there was no one who showed symptoms after all glutamate [3].', 'The available studies show that up to three grams of glutamate does not cause symptoms in a selected group of healthy individuals.']",1,"While there are anecdotal reports of glutamate hypersensitivity, no individual in a selected group showed symptoms after consuming glutamate, and up to three grams of glutamate did not cause symptoms in healthy individuals, making it unclear if glutamate in food can cause intolerance symptoms.","There is no conclusive evidence that the consumption of glutamate triggers complaints. However, since studies conducted to date have shown deficiencies, it cannot be ruled out that there are isolated individuals who react sensitively to large amounts of glutamate."
Does the Orthopulse device accelerate the orthodontic correction of malocclusions?,"['Little meaningful The three published studies [1-3] cannot convince: None of the studies actually investigates the entire duration of treatment, but only the speed of tooth movements in the correction phase of brace therapy.', 'This does not make any sure statements about the reduction of the overall duration of treatment with which the manufacturer advertises.', 'Theoretically, two effects of orthopulses would be conceivable: positive effects if the duration of treatment were shortened, or negative effects if conversion processes at the tooth root were accelerated.', 'Thus, it is also questionable whether the faster treatment with the orthopulse device actually results from infrared therapy: In the control group, the teeth move on average by 0.44 mm per week, in the group with the orthopulse device on average by 1.27 mm per week.']",1,"The studies on the Orthopulse device only investigate the speed of tooth movements during brace therapy, not the entire duration of treatment, providing insufficient evidence to confirm the manufacturer's claim of reduced overall treatment time.",Poorly done studies show that the device can accelerate tooth movement in the short term. Whether this reduces the overall treatment time has not yet been sufficiently proven. The methodological weaknesses of the studies also mean that the results are not very credible. Possible side effects have not yet been sufficiently investigated.
Is it harmful for the mental development of the unborn child if the mother regularly eats fish contaminated with mercury during pregnancy?,"['For previous studies suggest that the consumption of larger amounts of mercury-containing fish could slightly affect the mental performance of the offspring [1, 2, 3].', 'The studies in detail The fact that methyl mercury can damage the brain of unborn children already in concentrations in which the pregnant mothers themselves do not notice any symptoms is beyond question [6].', 'In investigations into the Faroe Islands and New Zealand, the assumption was confirmed: expectant mothers with high mercury levels were given children, whose mental performance was on average slightly worse in later tests than that of unloaded mothers – the mercury levels of the mothers were mostly so high, because they had consumed large amounts of contaminated fish before and during pregnancy.', 'Impact on the IQ Despite these contradictions, the consumption of contaminated fish seems to reduce the intelligence of the offspring measurable, although it is not yet clear how much.', ""A research team at Harvard University calculated an average reduction in the intelligence ratio of 0.7 points for each micrograms of mercury in mother's hair [2] in the analysis of studies from the Faroe Islands, Seychelles and New Zealand.""]",0,"The claim is supported by studies suggesting a slight decrease in mental performance of the offspring when the mother consumes large amounts of mercury-contaminated fish during pregnancy, with measurable reductions in IQ observed.","Many commercially available types of edible fish are contaminated with traces of methyl mercury.

In contrast, consumption of fish low in mercury could promote brain development in the unborn."
Can the consumption of caffeine during pregnancy harm the unborn child?,"['However, the study showed that it made no difference whether the participants drank around three cups of caffeine or decaffeinated coffee.', ""On average, the weight of birth at birth was about the same, was similar in size and was not more frequently born too early even after the mother's caffeine consumption."", 'Similar to the summary of the Cochrane overview work: In early pregnancy three cups of coffee daily would have no effect on birth weight, growth or premature birth [2].']",1,"The study's findings indicate that caffeine consumption during pregnancy, equivalent to around three cups of coffee, does not negatively impact birth weight, size, or gestational age at birth.",There is insufficient evidence that moderate consumption of caffeinated beverages would have a negative impact on the child's development. Up to three cups of coffee a day does not appear to reduce the child's birth weight. Very large amounts of caffeine-containing beverages could possibly contribute to lower birth weight.
Are vegetables prepared in a microwave oven less healthy than those prepared in other ways?,"['Recent studies see the matter more differentiated: Depending on the variety of vegetables and the exact type of preparation, the microwave can sometimes be better and sometimes worse suited than, for example, cooking [2-12].', 'In the worst case, if it is exaggerated with the duration and the number of watts, the corresponding food is less health-promoting, but in no way harmful to health.', 'If there are health problems related to the microwave, then this is not because the microwave ingredients are destroyed or changed, but because it is simply too unhealthy to eat altogether.', 'The week-long feeding with always several times warmed up in the microwave has not led to any signs of poisoning in the animals.']",2,"While some studies suggest that microwave preparation of vegetables can be better or worse than other methods depending on the type and duration, there is no evidence indicating that microwaved vegetables become harmful to health or that health issues related to microwaves stem from ingredient destruction.","How vegetables change during preparation is extremely variable. With any type of heating, ingredients can be lost or become more easily accessible. In sum, it cannot be said that preparation in the microwave is always a bad choice."
Can garlic extract reduce high blood pressure and thus the risk of cardiovascular disease?,"['Two better performed randomised-controlled studies provide cautious evidence that garlic can lower too high blood pressure [1].', 'However, even the results of these two studies are insufficiently valid for a clear assessment [1].', 'Whether garlic taken regularly can lower too high blood pressure and thus lower the risk of cardiovascular disease remains unclear for the time being.', 'At least in theory, there may also be interactions with anticoagulant drugs or side effects in persons with a tendency to bleed, as garlic is suspected to have an anticoagulant effect.']",1,"While two studies suggest garlic can lower high blood pressure, their validity is questioned, leaving it unclear if garlic can reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and potential interactions with anticoagulant drugs or side effects in individuals prone to bleeding.","Studies to date provide tentative evidence of a blood pressure-lowering effect of garlic. However, they are of too low quality to be able to prove a reduction in the risk of cardiovascular disease as a result of high blood pressure."
Can fructose damage the liver?,"['Fruit sugar as a cause not proven There are no meaningful indications for the assumption that fruit sugar is responsible for the development of the liver disease [1].', 'In other words, for the liver, it may not matter what kind of sugar you eat.']",1,"The claim that fructose can damage the liver is not supported by the provided sentences, which indicate that there is no substantial evidence linking fruit sugar to liver disease development, and the type of sugar consumed may not significantly affect the liver.",There is no conclusive evidence for a possible liver-damaging effect of fructose.
Is matcha tea particularly healthy?,"['No recommendations, no warnings Due to the current study situation, it is therefore not possible to make specific recommendations for tea consumption.', 'The studies in detail Matcha is the trend for many consumers, but in scientific literature this special green tea hardly exists.']",1,"The scientific literature on matcha, a popular type of green tea, is limited, making it difficult to make specific health recommendations regarding its consumption.","There is a lack of conclusive studies on the health effects of specific matcha.

Can acupuncture prevent migraines and tension headaches?,"['Acupuncture works... From chronic migraines or tension headaches Affected patients get significantly rare headache attacks when they not only take conventional medication, but also undergo prophylactic acupuncture treatment.', '...but as good as migraine medications Another point suggests that acupuncture has a valuable prophylactic effect – at least for migraine sufferers: Further studies showed that acupuncture can only partially prevent migraine attacks, but at least as well as common medications [1].']",0,"While some studies suggest acupuncture can reduce the frequency of migraine attacks at least as well as conventional medications, it only has a partial preventive effect.","In the case of migraine, the preventive effect of acupuncture is probably similar to that of prophylactic medication. However, for both migraine and tension headaches, acupuncture performs only slightly better than sham acupuncture. Whether the pricking of traditional acupuncture points plays a role is unclear."
Can plant sterols or foods with them reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease?,"['However, it is unclear whether the intake of such high amounts of plant sterols – e.g.', 'Whether these results are a coincidence or whether the higher rate of cardiovascular problems are actually due to plant sterols and not to other causes is unclear.', 'Cholesterol is also different Whether plant sterols can actually reduce not only LDL cholesterol levels, but also the risk of cardiovascular diseases, has not been investigated in a single clinical study.']",1,"While studies show that plant sterols can lower LDL cholesterol levels, there is no clinical study demonstrating that they reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases specifically.","Plant sterols do lower cholesterol levels. However, whether they also reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease has not been researched.

Can too much iodine cause autoimmune thyroid disease and consequently hypothyroidism?,"['Individual studies suggest that too large amounts of iodine may be responsible.', 'Probably a variety of causes These study results suggest that Hashimoto disease is more likely to occur in people with particularly high iodine consumption.', 'However, large amounts of iodine may cause serious disturbances in people with potentially undetected thyroid problems [8].', 'The studies in detail Whether large amounts of iodine can actually cause inflammation of the thyroid gland by an overreacting immune system is not well protected.', 'The result: the higher the iodine intake in a region, the greater the proportion of residents who suffer from autoimmune thyroid inflammation.']",0,"The claim is partially supported by individual studies suggesting a link between high iodine consumption and Hashimoto's disease, but the evidence is not conclusive on iodine directly causing inflammation of the thyroid gland or hypothyroidism.",Autoimmune thyroid disease appears to occur more frequently in individuals with high iodine consumption. Whether high levels of iodine actually cause this disease has not been conclusively determined.
Is the sweetener aspartame harmful to health?,"['The result: the sweetener is in all probability safe.', 'Safety levels Based on the results of numerous studies in laboratory animals and humans, the scientists established a safety limit for aspartame.', 'Thus, every person can take 40 milligrams per kilogram of body weight every day for the rest of his life without fear of health consequences.', 'Even those who exceed this amount will not suffer any health hazard.']",2,"Based on numerous studies in laboratory animals and humans, scientists have established a safety limit for aspartame, indicating that it is unlikely to be harmful to health when consumed within the recommended daily limit.","Health damage from aspartame is unlikely. This also applies to people who consume aspartame-sweetened foods and beverages in large quantities over a long period of time. However, in people suffering from the hereditary disease phenylketonuria (PKU), aspartame can cause nerve and brain damage."

Can FLEXISEQ ointment relieve osteoarthritis pain?,"[""So the ointment FLEXISEQ would have to be compared to a placebo ointment – that hasn't happened yet; compared to a medication to be swallowed, a placebo to be swallowed, and an ointment with an active substance, but its effectiveness itself is not too clear."", 'So it is not sure whether the ointment helps better than a suitable placebo.', 'The study duration in the four individual studies described is a maximum of 12 weeks, so long-term effects have not yet been investigated.']",1,"While there have been studies on FLEXISEQ ointment, they do not clearly demonstrate its superiority over a suitable placebo in relieving osteoarthritis pain, and long-term effects remain unexplored.",Comparisons to date with other commonly used treatments are difficult to interpret but do not yield clear evidence of efficacy.
Can butterbur prevent migraine attacks?,"['In summary, both studies show that it is twice as likely that the number of migraine attacks will halve after twelve weeks with the Pestwurz preparation compared to a dummy medication.', 'The above overviews are of different quality, but all come to the same conclusions due to the two same studies: Pestwurz can reduce the number of migraine attacks for some patients.']",0,"The two studies, though of varying quality, consistently conclude that butterbur, or Pestwurz, can reduce the frequency of migraine attacks for some patients.","Two well-done randomized-controlled trials show efficacy - the number of migraine attacks can probably be reduced with butterbur.

Is there a health risk from metal contaminants in lipsticks?,"['Risk in individual cases unclear The cited study by the team led by study leader Liu [1] analysed 32 products on their metal content.', 'The small amounts of lipstick thus do not lead to an increased risk of poisoning.', 'If the use of lipsticks is therefore a health risk when used very frequently, only more detailed and extensive studies can show.']",1,"While the study analyzed 32 lipstick products for metal content, it does not provide clear evidence of a health risk from metal contaminants in lipsticks, especially given the small amounts and unclear risk in individual cases.","Several chemical analyses find traces of metals in lipsticks, which can in principle be harmful in high concentrations. However, the analyses do not examine the quantities in which the metals are actually absorbed and whether they cause damage in the body.

Do rising temperatures and CO2 levels increase the risk of pollen allergy?,"['It is unclear whether the increase in CO2 has already caused a noticeable increase in the amount of pollen released.', 'Influence on allergy risk unclear However, whether the increasing pollen exposure also increases the risk of developing pollen allergy for non-allergic agents is unclear.', 'Whether higher levels of pollen increase the probability of hay fever is so far unclear [5].', 'There is nothing to read about pollen becoming more aggressive in so far published studies.']",1,"While there is evidence suggesting that increased pollen exposure may not necessarily increase the risk of developing pollen allergy for non-allergic individuals, the relationship between rising temperatures, CO2 levels, and pollen aggressiveness remains unclear due to a lack of relevant studies.","Rising temperatures and increased CO2 concentrations cause plants to produce larger amounts of pollen over a longer period of time. However, it is unclear whether larger amounts of pollen and a longer pollen season increase the likelihood of developing pollen allergy."
Does training on vibration platforms cause a noticeable buildup of muscle strength?,"['Therefore, training on vibration platforms could actually strengthen the muscle strength of the leg muscles.', 'However, compared to conventional strengthening training, the results do not indicate superiority of vibration platforms.', 'According to the results of this study, it could be concluded at most that training on a vibration platform in combination with a diet can lead to weight loss, which could also be achieved by a conventional fitness program or a mere diet without exercise program.']",0,"While training on vibration platforms may strengthen leg muscles to some extent, there is no evidence suggesting it is more effective than conventional strengthening training, and its primary benefit seems to be weight loss when combined with a diet, which can also be achieved through conventional fitness programs or diets without exercise.","Vibration training may be helpful for building muscle strength in the legs, but it is not better than conventional training for this purpose. Whether the method is also suitable for weight reduction has not been sufficiently studied."
Does glucosamine prolong life?,"['This is exactly what happens once again in the article on glucosamine as a life prolonger: The study was conducted on nematodes (fade worms) and mice and in which glucosamine led to an extended life span [1].', 'The conclusion of the researchers: If glucosamine has the same effect in two different species and these processes are also conceivable in humans, then glucosamine is highly likely to prolong life expectancy in humans.', 'Yes, with many limitations There is a cohort study on humans on this question: In 2010, a first evaluation looked at the influence of 20 vitamins or dietary supplements on life expectancy [3]; of these 20 only glucosamine and chondroitin showed a possible relationship with life expectancy.', 'The researchers speculate that glucosamine prolongs life expectancy just as was found in aspirin [2].', 'Until then, the life-prolonging effect of glucosamine remains optimistic speculation with little evidence.']",0,"While some studies suggest a possible relationship between glucosamine and life expectancy in nematodes and mice, human cohort studies provide limited evidence, and the life-prolonging effect remains speculative.","Although research here is still in its infancy and there is only one cohort study in humans besides basic studies, this shows possible effects. Further studies with better methods and other groups of participants are necessary."
Does Kinesio tape help in the treatment of joint and muscle injuries?,"['Therefore, it cannot be said whether the tape could contribute to the improvement of the pain after a long period of time.', 'Overall, the efficacy of Kinesio tape in musculoskeletal pain and injuries is at best unclear.', 'Since no studies have been carried out for more than 6 days, however, nothing can be said about a possible longer-term effect of the tape.']",1,"While some studies suggest short-term pain improvement with Kinesio tape use in musculoskeletal injuries, there is no clear evidence indicating its long-term efficacy or contribution to healing joint and muscle injuries, leaving its overall impact unclear.",There is no evidence that kinesio tape can reduce pain within a few days. It is unclear whether taping can help improve movement restrictions caused by an injury.
Do injections with Botulinum Toxin A (Botox®) help with urinary incontinence?,"['According to the standard, Botulinum Toxin A (known as Botox®) has been approved in Ireland and possibly other European countries for the treatment of incontinence caused by multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injuries.', 'Efficacy of Botulinum Toxin A A summary of the results of 19 randomised-controlled studies, each with a relatively small number of participants, shows good efficacy [1].', ""Therefore, a single series of injections with Botulinum Toxin A in the bladder's detrusor muscle can significantly reduce the frequency of urinary loss in patients with incontinence.""]",0,"The standard approval of Botulinum Toxin A (Botox®) in Ireland and possibly other European countries for multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injuries-related incontinence, along with the good efficacy demonstrated in several randomized-controlled studies, suggests that injections can help reduce urinary loss frequency in patients with incontinence.","Several small randomized-controlled trials show that injections of botulinum toxin A into the detrusor muscle surrounding the urinary bladder can reduce, but not completely prevent, the incidence of involuntary urinary leakage."
Can apigenin reduce cancer risk or prevent cancer progression?,"['On the other hand, a laboratory study [5] found that apigenin might inhibit the effect of chemotherapy treatments.', 'However, when treated with apigenin, the cancer cells became resistant to this drug and did not die.', 'Apigenine without influence on cancer risk What applies in small cases could also apply in large cases.', 'This showed that those participants who had eaten the most apigenine with food were not less likely to have cancer than other women in the study.', 'Unefficacious and possibly risky Apart from laboratory findings, previous observational studies show that the potential protective effect of apigenin is not able to significantly reduce the risk of cancer in normal diets [8].']",2,"The claim is refuted by the sentences provided, as there is no evidence supporting apigenin's ability to reduce cancer risk or prevent cancer progression, and it might even hinder chemotherapy treatments' effectiveness.","Studies suggest that even high levels of apigenin in food do not protect against cancer.

Do generic drugs work as well as original drugs?,"['Results & Interpretation In a review of 7 individual studies [1] published in 2010, three active substances against epilepsy were compared with generic drugs, with no evidence of an increased probability of seizures.', 'For none of the active substances studied, there was evidence of a lower efficacy of the generic medicinal product.', 'Based on the studies published so far, there is no evidence of inferiority of generic medicinal products compared to original medicinal products.']",0,"Based on the review of seven studies, there is no evidence to suggest that generic drugs are less effective than original drugs in treating epilepsy, and some studies even indicate similar efficacy.","Yes, the summarized results of clinical studies do not provide any evidence for a poorer efficacy of generics compared to originator drugs. However, comparative studies exist only for some agents against cardiovascular diseases and epilepsy."
Are animal-assisted therapies effective for mental illness?,"['The authors conclude from the data that animal assisted therapies may be effective in some diseases, including mental disorders and behavioural disorders such as depression, schizophrenia and addiction.', 'There is still no reliable data on the efficacy of animal-based therapy, for example in patients with cancer and advanced fatal diseases, in terms of state of health and quality of life.']",0,"The first sentence provides evidence that animal-assisted therapies may be effective for mental and behavioral disorders, but the second sentence indicates a lack of reliable data for their efficacy in patients with cancer and advanced fatal diseases, leaving the claim's applicability to all mental illnesses unsupported by the given sentences.","Studies on the effects of animal-assisted therapies are only partially conclusive. It seems plausible that animal-assisted therapies can be supportive for some mental illnesses; however, very large or rapid effects are unlikely."
Can lack of sleep cause obesity?,"['So, most likely, lack of sleep is just one of many different factors that can affect weight gain.', 'Cause unclear The mere fact that people with a lack of sleep are more likely to be overweight or gain more weight than those who sleep, however, does not necessarily mean that the lack of sleep is the real cause of obesity.', 'People who sleep too little usually have an unhealthy lifestyle in general, so other factors can also play a role in increasing weight gain.', ""Whether lack of sleep actually makes you fat can't be said from previous study results – even if there is evidence that people who sleep little may become overweight rather than people with normal sleep.""]",1,"While research suggests a correlation between lack of sleep and increased likelihood of obesity, it does not definitively establish lack of sleep as the cause, as other factors associated with poor sleep habits could also contribute to weight gain.",People who regularly get too little sleep may be more likely to be overweight than those who get enough sleep. But whether lack of sleep itself causes obesity is unclear.
Does copper intake increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease?,"[""Because there are no studies that associate an increased uptake of copper directly with an increased Alzheimer's risk [6].""]",1,The claim that copper intake increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease is not supported by a study directly associating increased copper uptake with an increased Alzheimer's risk.,Some studies claim to have found links between high copper levels and Alzheimer's disease. Whether copper intake actually has an impact on Alzheimer's risk is not clear.
Do air ions cause an improvement of asthma??,"['Compared to asthma patients who were exposed to dummy treatment, actual therapy with air ionization devices did not show any improvement in asthma symptoms or lung function.']",2,"Exposure to air ionization devices did not result in any improvement in asthma symptoms or lung function compared to patients who received a dummy treatment, according to a study.","Whether ionized air can reduce allergic symptoms is unclear, as no studies exist on this question. Air ionization devices do not appear to be effective against asthma in general."
Do smoking bans lead to fewer preterm births?,"['Smoking bans mean that mothers smoke less in pregnancy and that unborn women are exposed to less passive smoke.', 'It is a methodically very good work, but there are some limitations to the statements: the results of the individual studies vary greatly, whether the real effect is really 10% each, will only be able to clarify future studies.']",0,"The claim is partially supported by the first sentence, stating that smoking bans result in less smoking during pregnancy and reduced exposure to passive smoke for unborn women; however, the second sentence indicates variability in the results of individual studies and the need for future studies to confirm the exact effect.","A large review shows a 10% reduced risk of preterm birth. Due to some limitations, the evidence is nevertheless low, further studies from different countries will probably soon bring clarity."
Do special garments with the active ingredient Liporeductyl help against cellulite?,"['An effect could not be found for any active substance [1].', 'Or, to put it more carefully, for none of the innumerable forms of treatment have well-derived scientific evidence that speaks for effectiveness.']",1,"The claim that special garments with Liporeductyl help against cellulite is not supported by scientific evidence, as no effect was found for any active substance and there is no well-derived scientific proof for the effectiveness of the numerous treatment forms.","There are only small studies that neither stand up to methodological criteria nor have been scientifically published. Sustained efficacy has not been proven, which, according to the current status, applies to all common remedies against cellulite."
Does alcohol in moderate amounts prolong life?,"['Alcohol: Beyond good and evil As described in our article on red wine, moderate alcohol consumption probably has a positive effect on cardiovascular health [2]; moderate means an alcoholic drink per day – a small beer or an eighth of wine.']",0,"Moderate alcohol consumption, as defined in the article, is associated with potential cardiovascular health benefits, but the claim that it prolongs life cannot be directly inferred from the provided sentences.","In moderate amounts, alcohol could reduce the likelihood of dying prematurely. In higher doses, however, it clearly increases this risk. This is unclear for caffeine."
Does light freezing help with weight loss?,"['Much speculation, little knowledge A scientific work taken up by many media does not help with this question [1].', 'Nevertheless, weight loss was not significantly higher than after the same exercise program at more pleasant temperatures.']",1,"While some media outlets have speculated about the impact of light freezing on weight loss, a scientific study found that weight loss after exercise at cold temperatures was not significantly different from that at more pleasant temperatures.","Some laboratory studies show that the body reacts to colder temperatures with higher energy consumption and burns more fat. Nevertheless, it is completely unclear whether this supports weight loss; that is, whether the process is strong enough and whether other mechanisms do not work against it. Weight loss through freezing has not been investigated in clinical studies."
Does acupuncture help against hay fever?,"['As with other acupuncture studies, it is therefore questionable whether the improvement of hay fever symptoms was due to the needle stitches themselves.', 'In order to distinguish between the placebo effect and the specific effect of acupuncture in the future, further studies with better study designs are necessary.']",1,"The improvement of hay fever symptoms observed in the study may be attributed to a placebo effect rather than the needle stitches themselves, suggesting that further research with improved study designs is needed to determine the specific effect of acupuncture.",We have not found any meaningful studies that can provide evidence of improvement in hay fever.

Does marijuana use reduce the risk of developing diabetes?,"['Marijuana users have rare diabetes A cross-sectional study in 2012 of 10,896 US-Americans [2] revealed that marijuana consumers were less likely to suffer from diabetes.', 'However, they cannot show with certainty that the use of marijuana is actually responsible for the reduced risk of diabetes.', 'Marijuana may reduce risk factors The authors of a smaller cross-sectional study in 4657 subjects [3] found a connection between smoking marijuana and the reduced occurrence of insulin resistance, a precursor of diabetes.', 'People who regularly consumed marijuana had a 12 percent lower chance of developing insulin resistance.']",0,"The 2012 cross-sectional study indicates an association between marijuana use and lower diabetes prevalence, but it cannot establish causality, and a smaller study suggests marijuana may reduce insulin resistance, a diabetes precursor.",Two cross-sectional studies provide evidence for a diabetes-preventive effect of active ingredients from the cannabis plant. That the consumption of marijuana actually reduces the risk of diabetes has yet to be confirmed by extensive studies.
Does virgin conception exist?,"['Until now, fertilization without sexual contact – biologists refer to it as parthenogenesis – is only known from a few animal species.', 'In humans, the phenomenon is hardly researched, the present study is the only scientific study on this subject so far.']",1,"While parthenogenesis, or fertilization without sexual contact, has been observed in a few animal species, there is limited research on this phenomenon in humans, with only one scientific study conducted so far.","To date, only one study has been conducted on this issue.

Are movement exercises useful for back pain?,"['Targeted exercise to strengthen torso muscles should both relieve and prevent back pain.', 'As a systematic overview [1] shows, strengthening exercises can clearly prevent the recurrence of pain.', 'One of the results: Chronic cross pain (duration over twelve weeks) improves at least something when the sufferers perform regular exercise.']",0,"The sentences provide evidence that regular exercise can alleviate chronic cross back pain and prevent its recurrence, supporting the claim.","Exercise reduces the risk of getting back pain again and can relieve chronic back pain somewhat. However, quick relief from acute pain is not to be expected."
Does UV light reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease?,"['The result: 20 minutes under artificial UVA light may reduce blood pressure slightly in the short term.', 'Whether regular UVA irradiation can also reduce blood pressure in the long term cannot be predicted from this, longer-term studies would be necessary.', 'Cardiovascular diseases vs. cancer Overall, the evidence for reducing the heart risk from sunbathing is still insufficient – only more extensive and more precise studies can give an answer.']",1,"While a single exposure to artificial UVA light may temporarily reduce blood pressure, there is currently not enough evidence to predict whether regular UVA irradiation would have long-term effects on blood pressure or overall cardiovascular disease risk.","It is theoretically conceivable that UVB light could reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. However, studies published so far cannot sufficiently confirm this assumption."
"Is the Gynefix® contraceptive necklace as effective for contraception as the birth control pill or the ""IUD""?","['Result According to a systematic review by Cochrane Collaboration (O-Brien & Marfleet, 2008), the prevention effectiveness of the 6-member Gynefix® smelting chain is comparable to that of the copper-holding intrauterine pessar (Spirale) TCu380 or TCu380A (There are insufficient meaningful data available for the assessment of the smaller 4-member fetter).', 'In both cases – with an old and a new insertion device for the contraceptive chain – there is no significant difference between the spiral group and the Gynefix® group.', 'There is therefore no significant difference between copper spiral and contraceptive chains in both studies.']",0,"The Gynefix® contraceptive necklace's effectiveness is comparable to copper-holding intrauterine devices like the TCu380 or TCu380A, according to a Cochrane Collaboration review, with no significant difference between insertion devices or between copper spirals and contraceptive chains.","The 6-link copper-containing contraceptive necklace Gynefix® is comparable in contraceptive effectiveness to other copper-containing intrauterine devices (""IUDs"").

Does the drug fingolimod reduce the progression of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis similarly or better than previous drugs?,"['The recently newly approved active substance Fingolimod in Europe causes white blood cells (T cells) to be held back in the lymph nodes, which prevents them from causing inflammation by immigrating to the brain.', 'By means of systematic literature research, we wanted to find out whether fingolimod is similar to or better than previous multiple sclerosis – drugs can inhibit the progression of the disease.']",0,"The first sentence provides a mechanism for how fingolimod may affect multiple sclerosis, but it does not directly compare fingolimod's effectiveness to previous drugs, making it difficult to determine if the claim is supported or refuted based solely on this information.","Two manufacturer-funded clinical trials attest Fingolimod such efficacy that exceeds that of interferon beta therapy. However, the drug can also cause serious side effects."
Can cancer be successfully fought with intentionally induced fever?,"['==References== In the 19th century, the idea was born that fevers protect against cancer.', 'No major modern studies have been conducted in which deliberately triggered fever has been tested as therapy.']",1,"While the concept of fever as a cancer protector originated in the 19th century, no recent major studies have tested fever induction as therapy, leaving insufficient evidence to support or refute the claim.","In the early 20th century, cancer was indeed sometimes fought with fever, sometimes successfully.

Does treatment with the new drug erenumab reduce the number of migraine days per month?,"['In other words, compared to a sham medication, individuals with episodic migraines were spared on average 1 to 2 migraine days per month by erenumab [1-4].', 'So far no serious side effects The side effects of erenumab – as far as the earlier rather shorter studies at least – do not seem to be serious: those who used erenumab complained a little more frequently than those with the dummy medication about injection site reactions, constipation, muscle cramps and itching [6].', 'Because erenumab has so far only been compared with placebo.', 'No long-term data The results on efficacy and safety first sound as if people with a similar condition as in the studies could actually benefit from erenumab.']",0,"The claim is partially supported by the first sentence, which indicates that individuals with episodic migraines experienced fewer migraine days per month with erenumab compared to a sham medication; however, the claim cannot be fully evaluated due to the lack of comparisons with other treatments beyond a placebo and the absence of long-term data, as mentioned in the third and fourth sentences.","In five studies available to date, which tend to be shorter, participants suffered from migraine less frequently with erenumab than with a placebo. The studies were of high methodological quality. In episodic migraine, people ""saved"" about 1 to 2 migraine days per month .

Is screening by optical coherence tomography superior to conventional examinations for the early detection of diabetic macular edema?,"['Early detection: Optical coherence tomography unreliable Most diabetes patients with such pathological retinal damage will not notice symptoms such as dark spots in the field of vision or impairment of sharp vision long after the start.', 'However, laser treatment is not without risk, in some cases it may also result in an unwanted reduction in vision or other side effects that affect vision.']",2,"The claim is refuted by the first sentence, which states that early detection of diabetic macular edema with optical coherence tomography can be unreliable, as many patients with pathological retinal damage may not notice symptoms for a long time.","No, screening by optical coherence tomography alone is too inaccurate. An examination using an ophthalmoscope and pupil dilating eye drops or with the help of fundus photography is a safer method."
Does the treatment of diabetes-related retinal diseases by injection of VEGF inhibitors provide an advantage compared to conventional laser treatment?,"['The majority (5 out of 100 inhabitants) suffer from type 2 diabetes (formerly also called age diabetes), which is practically always lifestyle-related and in most cases is accompanied by overweight, one-sided diet and lack of exercise [ 4 ].', 'The presentation of the effectiveness of VEGF inhibitor injections as a new treatment method is also clearly exaggerated and biased – the newspaper article does not inform about risks and uncertainties.']",0,"The claim does not provide a direct comparison between VEGF inhibitor injections and conventional laser treatment for diabetes-related retinal diseases, and the sentences do not offer information about the relative efficacy or risks of these treatments.","There is evidence of better short-term efficacy for VEGF inhibitor injections compared with laser coagulation, but the method is insufficiently studied.
