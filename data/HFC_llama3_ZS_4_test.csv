Can probiotics lower blood sugar in type 2 diabetes?,"['And if so, can probiotics reverse this change and reduce blood sugar levels again?', 'At the most small effect, they may actually be able to.', 'However, the effect of the capsules and tablets does not seem to be large: in the previous studies, they were able to reduce the long-term sugar level HbA1c by an average of 0.55 points.']",0,"The claim that probiotics can lower blood sugar in type 2 diabetes is supported by the acknowledgement that they may have a small effect, specifically reducing HbA1c levels by an average of 0.55 points, although the impact is not substantial.","The summarized results of studies to date suggest that probiotics in capsule or tablet form could lower blood sugar somewhat. At least if they are taken over a period of two to three months. However, the effect is not well established. Probiotic dairy products and probiotic powder for dissolving do not seem to have any demonstrable effect."
"Can a bioresonance device like ""Bioscan"" or ""Vieva Vital Analyser"" measure mineral and vitamin deficiencies or detect health problems?","['This experiment clearly shows that the devices studied are completely unsuitable to diagnose a lack of vitamins or minerals.', 'Sentenced for fraud at the end of May 2022, a German court also concluded that the Bioscan device cannot fulfil the claimed claims.', 'Claims for comparable products are equally implausible.', 'Even if 1000 subjects had participated in the study and only five to six people had shown such unreliable readings, such a device would be worthless for diagnostics.']",2,"The claim that bioresonance devices like ""Bioscan"" or ""Vieva Vital Analyser"" can measure mineral and vitamin deficiencies or detect health problems is refuted by experimental evidence and a German court's conclusion that such devices are unsuitable for diagnosis, rendering their claims implausible.","An experiment shows that the devices cannot distinguish between healthy people, seriously ill people and a corpse. The claimed mode of action behind the measurement method is also scientifically implausible. A German court has convicted the manufacturers of the Bioscan device (not legally binding) of fraud."
Will women who have recurrent bladder infections get rid of them faster if they take cranberry products only after the disease is already there???,"['There is also only evidence that cranberry products can prevent bladder inflammation for otherwise healthy women.', 'However, there does not seem to be any meaningful studies that have investigated this in women with recurrent bladder inflammation.', 'The preventive effect of cranberry in children, men and people with urinary catheters or certain diseases has not been studied.']",1,"The claim that cranberry products can help women with recurrent bladder infections get rid of them faster is not supported by the available evidence, which only suggests a preventive effect in healthy women, with no studies investigating its therapeutic effect in women with existing recurrent bladder inflammation.","Women who repeatedly have to deal with bladder infections might become ill somewhat less frequently if they regularly take cranberry juice or extract. However, this is not well established. And it only applies to uncomplicated bladder infections in otherwise healthy women. Whether cranberry products help when cystitis is already present remains unclear. This has not yet been investigated in meaningful studies."
Can extract from St. John's wort relieve the symptoms of depression? Is it similarly effective as drugs against depression (antidepressants)?,"[""St John's wort: effective in mild to moderate depression Probably yes."", ""In mild to moderate depression, St John's wort preparations probably work better than placebo."", ""St John's wort preparations are probably as good as antidepressants."", ""St. John's wort and antidepressants can relieve the discomfort, but the depression can probably not cure for good.""]",0,"The claim that St. John's wort can relieve symptoms of depression and is similarly effective as antidepressants is supported by the sentences, which suggest that St. John's wort is effective in mild to moderate depression, works better than placebo, and is as good as antidepressants in relieving discomfort.",St. John's wort is likely to relieve the symptoms of mild to moderate depression better than a placebo. It also appears to be similarly effective to approved medications for depression (antidepressants). St. John's wort preparations are generally better tolerated than antidepressants.
Does pine wood improve sleep?,"['So there is no indication that the pine wood improves sleep.', 'The importance of these laboratory measurements for the sleep of the participants is unclear – even if the researchers interpret them as positive effects of the circling bed.', 'Whether a pine bed actually improves sleep would have to study more rigorous studies carried out according to scientific criteria on significantly more subjects in the future.The studies in detail [1,2] Grote et al.']",1,The claim that pine wood improves sleep is uncertain due to the lack of rigorous scientific studies and unclear interpretations of existing laboratory measurements.,"So far, only one small study has investigated this question. However, the results of this study are not conclusive due to numerous deficiencies in the conduct of the study."
Does high-dose vitamin D slow down the course of disease in multiple sclerosis (MS)?,"['However, such observations alone are not sufficient to actually demonstrate the benefit of highly dosed vitamin D in MS.   Studies on vitamin D in MS We have therefore been looking for meaningful studies on the high-dose treatment of vitamin D in multiple sclerosis.', 'At present, we cannot say for sure whether highly dosed vitamin D actually brings benefits to MS.', 'However, the data so far suggest that an effect, if any, would be rather small.']",1,"The claim that high-dose vitamin D slows down the course of disease in multiple sclerosis is uncertain because, despite suggestive observations, existing studies are insufficient to demonstrate a clear benefit, and any potential effect is likely to be small.","We can neither clearly exclude nor confirm that there is an effect. In a total of 15 studies, no benefit could be demonstrated for high-dose vitamin D in adults with multiple sclerosis. Because the studies had many weaknesses, we cannot draw any conclusions about positive or negative effects."
Do herbal remedies with nasturtium and horseradish alleviate the symptoms of cystitis as well as an antibiotic???,"['The antibiotic alleviated the discomfort faster than the product with capuchin cress and horseradish, after eight days there was no difference.', 'Therefore, the herbal agent is not likely to be a full substitute for an antibiotic.']",1,"The claim that herbal remedies with nasturtium and horseradish alleviate cystitis symptoms as well as an antibiotic is challenged by the finding that while the herbal agent eventually matches the antibiotic's effectiveness, it takes longer to do so.","As for prevention, we have found only one small but somewhat reliable study. According to this, nasturtium-horseradish remedies probably cannot prevent cystitis. For the treatment of cystitis, we were also only able to evaluate one study. However, it leaves too many questions unanswered to be able to clearly assess its effectiveness."
Does honey help against acute cough in children?,"['Probably effective – a little It turned out that honey as an anti-cough remedy is likely to have a certain justification.', 'With honey, the severity of the cough was about 2 points better the next day.', 'Thus, honey can obviously help children with acute cough a little by reducing discomfort and shortening their duration.', 'The shortening of the cough duration was also noticeable, but not spectacular: it was reduced from a good 5 days (with placebo) to about four and a half days (with honey).', 'Thus, honey is likely to have a positive effect both on the duration of coughing and on the symptoms associated with coughing, albeit on a modest scale.']",0,"The claim that honey helps against acute cough in children is supported by the findings that honey reduces the severity of cough, shortens its duration, and alleviates associated discomfort, albeit on a modest scale.","Honey should help children with acute cough: The coughing attacks are likely to become somewhat less frequent, weaker and less distressing. Children's and parents' sleep may also improve, and the time to resolution is likely to be a little shorter. However, the effects achieved are only small."
Can Artemisia tea cure malaria as well as drugs?,"['And even if there were no problems with resistance – it is questionable whether Artemisia remedies from non-professional self-cultivation could reliably compete with the standardized quality of artemisinin drugs.', 'Based on the studies available to us, we can neither clearly demonstrate nor completely exclude the benefit of Artemisia tea for sustainable malaria treatment with low relapse probability.']",1,"The claim that Artemisia tea can cure malaria as well as drugs is uncertain because while some studies suggest it may be beneficial, the quality of self-cultivated remedies cannot be guaranteed, and the available evidence is not conclusive.","Four studies with a total of relatively few participants come to contradictory results. Since all studies have problems, we cannot draw any meaningful conclusions about the healing success - i.e., we can neither confirm nor exclude a positive lasting effect."
Does Chaga mushroom help against cancer or other diseases?,"['Such study results cannot say anything concrete about the effect in the human body.', 'It is therefore impossible to answer whether the chaga mushroom can cure or prevent diseases.']",1,"The claim that Chaga mushroom helps against cancer or other diseases is uncertain because the available study results are inconclusive and cannot be directly applied to the human body, making it impossible to determine its effectiveness in preventing or curing diseases.",The effect of Chaga mushrooms has not yet been investigated in studies with humans.
Does magnetic resonance therapy improve complaints of knee osteoarthritis or herniated discs (e.g. pain)?,"['Their results, however, raise doubts about the effect of nuclear resonance therapy against pain and other complaints.', 'None of the studies showed a pain-relieving effect.', 'Twelve weeks later, according to the team of authors, there were no differences in pain, daily limitations and quality of life between the treatment group and the control group.']",2,"The claim that magnetic resonance therapy improves complaints of knee osteoarthritis or herniated discs, such as pain, is challenged by the findings that none of the studies showed a pain-relieving effect and that there were no differences in pain between the treatment and control groups after 12 weeks.","Previous studies of MBST nuclear magnetic resonance therapy have shown no difference from sham treatment - suggesting that the treatment does not help. However, this judgment cannot be well supported due to the lack of power of the studies."
Are oral zinc supplements effective for treating a cold (chill)?,"['But according to the current state of knowledge, zinc preparations may help adults [1] to recover a little faster.', 'According to previous studies [1], adults taking zinc could reduce the duration of their cold by around one and a half days.', 'According to the summarized study results, the intake of zinc supplements in adults could reduce the duration of the disease by 1.8 days.', 'Consequently, it may be worth taking zinc supplements for adults if they want to significantly reduce the duration of the disease.']",0,"The claim that oral zinc supplements are effective for treating a cold is supported by the sentences, which consistently suggest that zinc preparations can help adults recover faster and reduce the duration of their cold by around one to two days.","It is possible that oral zinc supplements may slightly shorten the duration of a cold in adults. However, many details concerning efficacy and safety are still unclear. Studies to date cannot answer the question of whether zinc also has a preventive effect - they are not conclusive enough."
Do probiotics alleviate the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome?,"['Thus, probiotics as a whole could possibly help with irritable bowels.', 'With probiotics there was relief in just under half, with placebo in only one third.', 'Although the probiotics usually cut off better than the sham medication, the effect was very small.']",0,"The claim that probiotics alleviate the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome is supported by the findings that probiotics provided relief in nearly half of the cases, outperforming the sham medication, although the effect was small.","Three summaries of the best available studies consistently found a small effect. However, it is unclear whether the computationally ""visible"" effect is actually noticeable for people with irritable bowel syndrome. There is also evidence that not all studies have been published."
Can echinacea protect against Sars-CoV-2 infection or help treat covid-19?,"['Even if Echinacea could help against a number of cold viruses, this would not yet prove that it also helps with Covid-19.', 'The European Medicines Agency (EMA) therefore advises from an application up to the age of 12 years and in pregnant women from [3].The studies in detail Despite extensive research in the research databases Pubmed, Cochrane Library and Epistemonikos, we could not find clinical studies with human participants in which the effectiveness of Echinacea was investigated to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection.']",1,The claim that echinacea can protect against Sars-CoV-2 infection or help treat covid-19 is unsubstantiated due to the lack of clinical studies with human participants investigating its effectiveness in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection.,There are no clinical studies on the prevention of Covid-19. The only study on the treatment of Covid-19 does not allow an assessment due to numerous shortcomings.
Do dietary supplements with magnesium and/or zinc improve symptoms in children with ADHD?,"['Studies on Magnesium For the benefit of magnesium in ADHD, we have not found a randomized controlled study.', 'In addition, there are further shortcomings, which is why the studies are not meaningful: In one study [1] all children received treatment with certain psychopharmaceuticals, which no longer corresponds to the current state of science.', 'The results of the studies are contradictory: two studies [5.6] suggested a positive effect of zinc.', 'In three other studies [3, 4, 7] there were no differences between the zinc and control groups.']",1,"The claim that dietary supplements with magnesium and/or zinc improve symptoms in children with ADHD is uncertain due to the lack of a randomized controlled study on magnesium and contradictory results from zinc studies, with some suggesting a positive effect and others showing no difference.","For magnesium, we did not find any meaningful studies. For zinc, we were able to identify several studies that appear interesting at first glance. However, the studies are deficient, contradictory and possibly not transferable to the situation in Europe. Therefore, we cannot derive any definite statements."
"Can the ""Miracle Mineral Supplement"" MMS (sodium chlorite) cure diseases or alleviate ailments?","['No meaningful studies on MMS There is no evidence that MMS can cure diseases or relieve discomfort.', 'However, there is not the slightest indication that MMS could help against cancer or any other disease such as an infection with coronaviruses.', 'However, this study is so poor that its published results are not meaningful.', 'We doubt, for many reasons, that the reported results can be translated into ""real life"": it is questionable whether the two groups were comparable at the beginning of the study – for example, whether they were equally seriously ill or had an equally high risk of a serious disease.']",1,"The claim that MMS can cure diseases or alleviate ailments is unsubstantiated due to the lack of meaningful studies and the questionable methodology of existing research, which fails to provide convincing evidence of its effectiveness.","Experts around the world warn against the use of MMS. In several cases, the agent has caused severe poisoning. Claims about a healing effect are untenable rumors. There is no evidence that the substance is effective against autism, malaria, cancer, AIDS or hepatitis, or that it helps with an infection with the coronavirus (Covid-19)."
Does regular gargling with antimicrobial mouthwashes protect against contracting coronavirus? Does it help get better faster if you have Covid 19 disease?,"['We also wanted to know if people with Covid-19 have less complaints and easier procedures when gurgling regularly.', ""We couldn't find any completed studies on this.""]",1,The claim that regular gargling with antimicrobial mouthwashes protects against contracting coronavirus or helps with Covid-19 recovery is unsubstantiated due to the lack of completed studies on the topic.,"Antimicrobial mouthwashes can reduce the amount of corona viruses in the mouth and throat. However, it is not certain that this will result in a faster resolution of the symptoms of covid 19 disease. There are no studies on this yet. The same applies to the preventive effect of regular gargling with mouth rinses. Theoretically, however, there are many arguments against efficacy."
Do self-performed nasal drill tests in symptom-free individuals detect coronavirus infection as reliably as professionally performed rapid tests using swabs from the nasopharynx?,"['The rather sobering result of the only study that we could find: 10 complaints-free, infected persons do the nose drill test, then this should overlook the infection in 6 to 9 cases [1].', 'About three quarters of the symptomless infections are likely to remain unrecognized.', 'The swab from the nasal throat with subsequent evaluation by the PCR is currently the most reliable method to detect Coronavirus infection [3].The studies in detail Nose drilling instead of professional fast tests?']",1,"The claim that self-performed nasal drill tests can detect coronavirus infection as reliably as professionally performed rapid tests is challenged by the finding that the nasal drill test may overlook infection in 6 to 9 out of 10 cases in symptom-free individuals, making the swab from the nasal throat with PCR evaluation a more reliable method.","The nasal drill test is said to be less complicated and less unpleasant than the rapid test with a deep swab from the nasopharynx. However, it is unclear whether both test methods provide similarly reliable results. To date, there has been no direct comparison of self-performed nasal drill testing and rapid nasopharyngeal testing by trained personnel.  Comparisons with the PCR test, currently the most reliable coronavirus detection method, however, show: In people without covid-19 symptoms, the nasal pick test is rather unreliable. About three quarters of infections could be missed."
Does CBD help with sleep disorders?,"['The impact of CBD on sleep has not yet been seriously investigated [7].', 'They have not investigated whether CBD regularly ingested over a long period of time helps with sleep disorders.', 'Whether the participants fell asleep with CBD earlier and their sleep was deeper, the research team did not measure intelligibly.', 'Differences in sleep effects between CBD and dummy preparation could not be discovered by the research group in its study.']",1,"The claim that CBD helps with sleep disorders is uncertain because existing research has not thoroughly investigated its long-term effects on sleep, failed to measure its impact on sleep quality, and did not find significant differences between CBD and a placebo in terms of sleep effects.",We could not find any meaningful studies on this question.
Does Spirulina help with obesity?,"['Without foundation is also the claim that Spirulina can increase heart health and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.', 'That Spirulina can help with diabetes is another myth.', ""For none of Spirulina's health claims there are meaningful studies that can demonstrate an effect."", 'Whether Spirulina can help with weight loss can therefore neither be proved nor refuted.']",1,"The claim that Spirulina helps with obesity is uncertain because the provided sentences suggest that there is a lack of meaningful studies to support any of Spirulina's health claims, including weight loss.","According to various studies, spirulina is supposed to help with asthma, allergies, diabetes or even chronic pain, reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease or help with weight loss. However, due to serious flaws, the results of these studies are not trustworthy."
Does spirulina have a health-promoting effect???,"['Without foundation is also the claim that Spirulina can increase heart health and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.', 'That Spirulina can help with diabetes is another myth.', 'Myth Variety Many other effects are attributed to the Spirulina algae, but for none of them there is evidence in the form of reliable data.', ""For none of Spirulina's health claims there are meaningful studies that can demonstrate an effect."", 'Whether Spirulina can help with weight loss can therefore neither be proved nor refuted.']",1,"The claim that spirulina has a health-promoting effect is questionable since there is no reliable data or meaningful studies to support its alleged benefits, including heart health, diabetes, and weight loss.","According to various studies, spirulina is supposed to help with asthma, allergies, diabetes or even chronic pain, reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease or help with weight loss. However, due to serious flaws, the results of these studies are not trustworthy."
Does treatment with focused high-intensity ultrasound (HIFU) reduce abdominal girth?,"['Ultrasound treatment – if at all – should not have a great effect.', 'Twelve weeks after the end of treatment, the abdominal circumference at the waist was one centimetre lower than after a dummy treatment without ultrasound.', 'Compared to the sham treatment, it detected a reduction of one centimetre in the group with the highest ultrasonic intensity.']",0,"The claim that HIFU treatment reduces abdominal girth is supported by the finding that the abdominal circumference was one centimetre lower after HIFU treatment compared to the sham treatment, suggesting a small but measurable effect.","In a study with low significance, the abdominal circumference at the waist decreased by 1 cm after 3 months. In our estimation, this uncertain effect is very small or hardly visible."
Does focused ultrasound (HIFU) treatment reduce wrinkles and sagging of the skin?,"['Unproven allegation However, there is no scientific evidence of this effect.', 'However, we could not find such studies – despite extensive research in several research databases.', 'What we have found are studies with very low significance, which have compared only different HIFU treatment strengths [1-3].', 'They cannot answer whether the HIFU method does anything.']",1,"The claim that focused ultrasound (HIFU) treatment reduces wrinkles and sagging of the skin lacks conclusive evidence, as extensive research has only yielded studies with low significance that fail to provide a definitive answer.","We did not find any conclusive studies. So whether HIFU has a visible effect is not solidly studied. However, there are reports of significant pain, redness and swelling."
Do curd compresses have an analgesic effect (e.g. for muscle and joint pain)? Do they have an antipyretic effect? Do curd compresses help breastfeeding women with lactation congestion?,"['Nine years later, we too could not find meaningful research results on pot wrapping during an extensive research.', 'But it is unclear whether pots also have a benefit.', 'The fact that a quark pack helps just as well as a cool pack, however, cannot be shown by the examination – because it is too deficient.', 'However, how well they actually relieve pain and swelling is not well studied [3,4].', 'It is also unclear how pot wraps are supposed to relieve pain and inflammation.']",1,"The claim that curd compresses have analgesic, antipyretic, and lactation congestion relief effects is not supported by sufficient research, as existing studies are deficient and unclear about their benefits and mechanisms of pain and inflammation relief.",We could not find any conclusive studies on curd wraps. Whether the effect goes beyond a cooling effect is unclear.
Do people with blood group AB have a higher risk of developing dementia?,"['The result: None of the four known blood groups were remarkably common among people with dementia.', 'The four blood groups A, B, AB and 0 were similarly distributed among dementia patients as among the healthy average population.', 'Blood type AB: no panic However, bad results in thinking and memory tasks do not automatically mean that dementia begins.', 'The study therefore provides no indication that the blood type was directly responsible for the mental impairments.', 'The direct conclusion that blood type AB increases the risk of mental impairment is not confirmed by the results.']",2,"The claim that people with blood group AB have a higher risk of developing dementia is not supported by the study's findings, which show that the distribution of blood groups among dementia patients is similar to that of the healthy population, and no direct link between blood type AB and mental impairments is established.","The risk of dementia appears to be similar for people of all four blood groups (A, B, AB, 0). This was shown by two studies that evaluated data from more than 9,000 affected individuals. The claim spread in the media that the AB blood group increases the risk of dementia is therefore unlikely to be true."
Does biotin help with hair loss? Does biotin make hair grow faster?,"['Unclear effect on hair loss and hair growth Our search for scientific evidence for the claimed effects of biotin remained unsuccessful.', 'We can neither answer whether Biotin makes hair grow faster, nor can the vitamin stop hair loss.', 'The scientists found no difference in hair growth between the biotin and placebo groups [1].', 'Evidence still has to be provided Whether biotin is effective or ineffective, we cannot say on this basis.', 'The study concluded that the intake of biotin had no effect on hair growth.']",1,"The claim that biotin helps with hair loss and makes hair grow faster is uncertain due to the lack of scientific evidence and inconsistent study results, which found no difference in hair growth between biotin and placebo groups.","The number of studies dealing with the effect of biotin on hair growth is insufficient. According to current research, a positive effect has not been confirmed."
Is mannose as good as or better than antibiotics for preventing recurrent cystitis?,"['Overall, therefore, there is no certainty at this stage whether mannosis is actually effective and safe when it comes to preventing bladder inflammation.', 'Therefore, it is not certain whether mannosis is actually better tolerated than an antibiotic.']",1,"The claim that mannose is as good as or better than antibiotics for preventing recurrent cystitis is uncertain because the effectiveness and safety of mannose in preventing bladder inflammation, as well as its tolerability compared to antibiotics, are still unclear.","In two studies, bladder infections occurred with a similar frequency or even less frequently with mannose than with an antibiotic. However, the studies are so poorly done that the results are not trustworthy."
Does taking vitamin K lower the risk of spinal fractures in older women?,"['No benefit – or at most a small one The results of the studies, however, are rather disappointing: vertebral fractures could not be safely prevented with vitamin K. In the case of fractures on other bones, the overall benefit was small: without vitamin K, 30 out of 1000 people had broken bones.']",2,"The claim that taking vitamin K lowers the risk of spinal fractures in older women is challenged by the study results, which found no safe prevention of vertebral fractures and only a small overall benefit in preventing fractures on other bones.","Taking vitamin K probably does not reduce the risk of vertebral fractures. However, this assessment is not well supported. The risk of other bone fractures could possibly be reduced - but only slightly. This estimate is also subject to some uncertainty."
Can red mold rice products lower blood cholesterol levels?,"['The summarized results of previous studies show that redhead rice probably has a favourable influence on high cholesterol levels [1,2].', 'According to analysis, redhead rice products can reduce elevated cholesterol levels similarly well as the common medicine simvastatin.', ""Again, the author's team found indications that the rice products can have a beneficial influence on cholesterol levels.""]",0,"The claim that red mold rice products can lower blood cholesterol levels is supported by the summarized results of previous studies and analysis, which suggest a favourable influence on high cholesterol levels and a beneficial effect similar to the common medicine simvastatin.","Red mold rice naturally contains the substance lovastatin, which acts as a cholesterol-lowering agent. The concentration of lovastatin in products made from red mold rice can vary greatly. Therefore, it is not certain that red mold rice is as effective as drugs containing a controlled amount of lovastatin. Depending on the dosage, undesirable side effects from red mold rice are possible - just as with the ""real"" drugs."
Do essential oils protect against corona infections and other viral infections like colds or flu?,"['There was no difference between those who swallowed the oils and those who took a sham medication (placebo).', 'In addition, we could not find any studies that investigated the effect of essential oils directly on humans.', 'It is questionable whether a room air treated with essential oils can prevent them.']",1,The claim that essential oils protect against corona infections and other viral infections is unsubstantiated due to the lack of studies demonstrating their direct effect on humans and the failure to show a difference between essential oil treatment and placebo in preventing infections.,"In laboratory tests, some essential oils can successfully kill viruses. Whether spraying, inhaling or swallowing the oils also protects against infections with viruses such as the Corona virus in real life is unclear. It has not been scientifically studied yet."
"Does propolis have a preventive or soothing effect against infection with coronavirus, colds or flu?","['Scientifically meaningful evidence of an infection-preventing effect of Propolis could not be found despite intensive search.', 'Because so far studies have not investigated whether the use of Propolis can protect against the Coronavirus.', 'However, it is not possible to conclude that Propolis alone is effective from a combination product.', 'However, the fact that the use of Propolis can also prevent viral infections is a fallacy.']",1,"The claim that propolis has a preventive or soothing effect against infection with coronavirus, colds, or flu is unsubstantiated as scientific evidence fails to demonstrate a conclusive infection-preventing effect, and existing studies do not investigate its effectiveness against coronavirus or viral infections in general.","To date, there are no studies that have investigated the effect of propolis in these viral infections."
Does LOW dose atropine (0.05% or less) sustainably inhibit the progression of myopia in children???,"['Therefore, the study cannot answer how well atropine works at a concentration of 0.01% or 0.1%.']",1,The study's inability to provide information on the effectiveness of atropine at concentrations of 0.01% or 0.1% implies that it does not provide conclusive evidence to support or refute the claim that low dose atropine (0.05% or less) sustains the progression of myopia in children.,"Drip-feeding high-dose atropine for 1-3 years probably inhibits the progression of myopia in the short term. If dripping is done daily, the effect does not seem to be noticeable 1 year after the end of treatment. If dripping is done monthly at first and then every 2 months, the effect is likely to last longer. Whether lower-dose atropine helps in the long term is poorly understood."
Can therapy with EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) alleviate the symptoms of people with post-traumatic stress disorder?,"['Probably effective Our research revealed that people with post-traumatic stress disorder are probably better off after a psychotherapy with EMDR than people who have not received any psychotherapeutic treatment at all.', 'Our conclusion With EMDR therapy, post-traumatic stress disorder is likely to improve more than completely without therapy.', 'That they are effective has been shown in well conducted studies [1].Studies in detail Since the 1990s, the topic of trauma therapy has been intensively researched using EMDR.', 'The result: with EMDR therapy, the subjects had less complaints than without any treatment.']",0,"The claim that EMDR therapy can alleviate PTSD symptoms is supported by the sentences, which collectively suggest that research has consistently shown EMDR to be an effective treatment, leading to improved outcomes and reduced complaints in individuals with PTSD.",Therapy with EMDR is probably more effective than no therapy at all for people suffering from the psychological consequences of a traumatic experience. Its effectiveness may be similar to that of exposure therapy. This is a widely established and well-studied form of psychotherapy.
Does the additional offer of HIV self-testing cause more people to take an HIV test?,"['HIV self-tests are attractive Overall, the nine international studies conclude that the supply of HIV self-tests is likely to lead to more people passing an HIV test.', 'Thus, an extended range of self-tests is likely to lead to more people taking an HIV test globally.', 'Apparently, the supply of HIV self-tests leads to more tests, especially in those groups, which make little use of the already existing offer.']",0,"The claim that the additional offer of HIV self-testing causes more people to take an HIV test is supported by the sentences, which consistently suggest that the supply of HIV self-tests leads to an increase in people taking an HIV test, particularly in groups that underutilize existing testing options.","Current research provides very strong evidence that the addition of HIV self-testing leads to more people taking an HIV test. Among others, people for whom testing at health facilities by professionals is not acceptable for various reasons also make use of this offer."
Can injecting stem cells into the knee joint relieve pain and limitations associated with osteoarthritis?,"['Whether the therapy can appreciably relieve pain and movement restrictions in case of knee arthritis remains unclear [1].', 'Our conclusion: At the moment, the therapy with stem cells in the case of arthrosis in the knee is not matured.', 'Because whether the stem cells arrived in the knee actually do what they should do and form new cartilage is also uncertain.', 'Effect probably not noticeable The result: according to statistical analysis, the test subjects from the stem cell group had less pain on average.']",1,"The claim that injecting stem cells into the knee joint relieves pain and limitations associated with osteoarthritis is uncertain due to the unclear efficacy of the therapy in reducing pain and movement restrictions, and the questionable ability of stem cells to form new cartilage in the knee.",It is unclear whether stem cells injected into the knee for osteoarthritis have a curative effect.  Possible side effects and dangers are also insufficiently researched.
Can an extract of Desmodium promote liver health or relieve other ailments?,"['Whether desmodium improves the function of the liver or even heals liver damage, has apparently not been researched in meaningful studies.', 'The studies in detail We could not find meaningful studies on Desmodium.']",1,"The claim that Desmodium extract promotes liver health or relieves other ailments lacks conclusive evidence, as there are no meaningful studies that have investigated its effects on liver function or damage.",We found no conclusive studies on the efficacy of Desmodium - neither on liver health nor for any other application.

Can healing clay help with gastritis?,"['Despite intensive research in several research databases, we could not find meaningful studies in which the effect of healing soil was investigated.', 'Thus, there is no evidence that healing earth relieves problems with gastritis.', 'The studies in detail We could not find meaningful studies on the effect of healing soil in gastritis.']",1,"The claim that healing clay can help with gastritis is unsubstantiated due to the lack of meaningful studies investigating its effect on gastritis, as evident from the absence of relevant research in multiple databases.",We could not find a meaningful study that scientifically examined this question.
Do heat patches containing capsaicin help with neck pain???,"['The study team reported that people who wear a capsaicin-containing heat patch four weeks a day have just as much (or little) neck pain as people with a placebo patch without an active substance.', 'Further studies with a larger number of participants must confirm whether heat patches with capsaicin are actually ineffective.', 'This indicates that the patches with capsaicin do not have any special analgesic effect.']",2,"The claim that heat patches containing capsaicin help with neck pain is challenged by the study's findings that participants who wore capsaicin-containing patches experienced the same level of neck pain as those with placebo patches, suggesting a lack of analgesic effect.",Studies on the pain-relieving effect of heat pads and self-heating plasters are contradictory.
Do heat patches help with lower back pain?,"['This substance creates a feeling of warmth on the skin, but does not become warm itself.', 'According to their results, it is likely that both types of heat patches can relieve pain in the lower back.', 'Carrying self-warming patches for three days has on average improved the pain in the lower back by 18 points on the 100s scale [1].', 'In addition to movement exercises or painkillers, the heat patches are probably pain-relieving [1,3].']",0,"The claim that heat patches help with lower back pain is supported by the results of a study that found both types of heat patches can relieve pain in the lower back, with self-warming patches showing an average improvement of 18 points on a 100-point scale.","Heat patches produce heat by means of a chemical reaction.

However, those who use antibacterial soaps for this purpose are very unlikely to contract infectious diseases any less frequently than people who use conventional soap. This statement applies to soaps containing the active ingredients triclosan or triclocarban. Whether other antibacterial active ingredients in soaps work better has not been investigated."

"Can choline ingested with food - alone or in the form of lecithin, for example - improve memory?","['However, the study did not provide clear evidence that choline is the cause of better memory performance.', 'Poor study quality Two other studies investigated how the uptake of pure choline in the form of food additives affects brain performance.', 'However, the significance of the two studies is limited: only very few subjects had taken part in the methodologically poor studies.', 'However, this result cannot be transferred to people with normal diets: with daily food, most of us absorb at least moderate amounts of choline.', 'Conclusion: great uncertainty Overall, a memory-promoting effect of choline or lecithin from food cannot be reliably demonstrated.']",1,"The claim that ingested choline or lecithin can improve memory is uncertain due to the lack of clear evidence from studies, which were either methodologically poor or had limited participant numbers, and the fact that people typically absorb moderate amounts of choline from their daily diet.",Studies conducted to date provide no clear indication of whether supplemental intake of choline leads to improved memory in healthy people or in people with dementia who are not choline deficient.
Does white sugar cause cancer?,"['However, this does not mean that sugar in itself is a direct risk factor and causes cancer.', 'Despite already extensive research, the exact role sugar plays and whether it represents an additional risk, apart from its contribution to the calorie balance, has to be examined even better and more comprehensively.', 'However, not all the causes have yet been clarified and above all, coincidence seems to play a major role: ""For many tumors, random errors in cell division are responsible, which cannot be prevented,"" says the German Cancer Research Center.', 'Overall, there is no scientific evidence that sugar significantly affects the risk of cancer.', 'The studies therefore do not allow a statement as to whether a sugary diet can cause cancer.']",1,"The claim that white sugar causes cancer is disputed as the provided sentences suggest that while sugar may contribute to calorie balance, there is no scientific evidence to support a direct link between sugar consumption and cancer risk, and other factors such as random cell division errors may play a more significant role.","Studies on white sugar cannot be found, but a link between sugar in general and cancer has also not been established."
Do wound care products with sodium hypochlorite such as ActiMaris promote the healing process of wounds?,"['Good studies on sodium hypochlorite are missing After laboratory experiments are not easily transferable to humans, however, it is difficult to predict how the active substance actually behaves on wounds, such as at which concentrations it is no longer harmful.', 'There is no study comparing sodium hypochlorite containing with already established wound treatments or dummy preparations.', 'Thus, we are currently unable to assess whether and how these products affect the recovery of chronic or fresh wounds.', 'The accompanying texts also do not contribute significantly to the clarification.']",1,"The claim that wound care products with sodium hypochlorite, such as ActiMaris, promote the healing process of wounds is uncertain due to the lack of good studies, untransferable laboratory experiments, and the absence of comparative studies with established treatments or placebos.","We could not find any high-quality studies that investigated the influence of highly diluted sodium hypochlorite on the healing of chronic wounds. The same applies to fresh wounds and burns.

"Is wheat lectin, which is found in high amounts especially in whole wheat, harmful to health?","['Although there is so far no evidence of the danger of wheat lecithin, which has been part of our diet for millennia, it is claimed via the Internet and the media that it could not only cause intestinal damage in humans.', 'However, for a causal relationship to these diseases there are no tangible indications [5].', 'Questions to the whole grain All in all, the information from the scientific literature is therefore rather unsatisfactory: the present studies in animals (in vivo) and cells in the test tube (in vitro) [4] do not provide a basis for alarming.', 'Our conclusion Based on the current study situation, a waiver of wheat whole grain products does not seem to make sense.', 'At present, a risk from wheat lecithin is simply not tangible – quite in contrast to the advantages of a balanced diet that contains a lot of whole grain.']",2,"The claim that wheat lectin is harmful to health is not supported by scientific evidence, as studies have not found tangible indications of a causal relationship between wheat lectin and diseases, and the benefits of a balanced diet with whole grains outweigh any potential risks.","There are no well-done long-term observations on healthy people from the general population. Therefore, there is a lack of robust data on the benefits and risks of a long-term diet without wheat lectin or whole wheat.

Because there have been no studies on this coffee blend with human test subjects, we cannot make any reliable statements."
Does skipping breakfast increase heart attack risk?,"['Obviously, therefore, the main reason for the increased risk of heart attacks was not to skip the morning meal, but overweight, diabetes, increased blood pressure, or too high cholesterol levels.', 'Thus, it is unclear whether the omission of breakfast leads to overweight or excess weight leads to the omission of breakfast.']",1,"The claim that skipping breakfast increases heart attack risk is uncertain because the relationship between breakfast omission and heart attack risk is confounded by underlying factors such as overweight, diabetes, and high cholesterol levels, making it unclear whether skipping breakfast is a cause or effect of these conditions.","There is no clear evidence that not eating breakfast could be a cause of obesity and, as a consequence, an increased risk of heart attack. It is possible, however, that it is primarily those people who are overweight and have a higher heart risk who forgo their morning meal."
Do whole grains lower the likelihood of dying early?,"['Against cancer, heart problems and diabetes The current study situation shows something else: Those who frequently resort to whole grains get less cancer or cardiovascular diseases, for example a heart attack [1–4].', 'Thus, people in whom whole grains play a major role in their daily diet seem to live longer and healthier.', 'All four summaries come to the same conclusion: They show a clear correlation between a full-grain diet and a reduced chance of dying early.', 'At least as far as the reduced risk of disease is concerned, the data show a robust dose-effect relationship: the more whole grains are eaten, the lower the risk of disease [6].']",0,"The claim that whole grains lower the likelihood of dying early is supported by the sentences, which consistently suggest a correlation between a diet rich in whole grains and a reduced risk of disease and early death, with the data even showing a dose-effect relationship.",People who eat whole grain products instead of foods made from refined flour are likely to live longer and probably have a lower risk of dying from cancer or cardiovascular disease.
Does sugar consumption increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes regardless of obesity?,"['Soft drinks increase the risk of diabetes People with a preference for large amounts of sugar-containing sodas also suffer more frequently from diabetes.', 'In their analyses, two research teams [1,2] were able to independently show that the more sugar the study participants consume in the form of soft drinks, the higher the probability of developing type 2 diabetes.', 'It seems that daily consumption of sugared soft drinks can trigger diabetes over many years even if it does not make you fat.', 'Sugar content of other foods with unclear influence The association with type 2 diabetes is relatively clear for soft drinks.']",0,"The claim that sugar consumption increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes regardless of obesity is supported by the sentences, which suggest that high sugar intake from soft drinks is linked to a higher probability of developing type 2 diabetes, even if it does not lead to obesity.","Sugar-containing soft drinks can - if consumed regularly - cause obesity. Obesity, in turn, increases the likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes. However, sugared soft drinks probably also increase the risk of diabetes independently of obesity."
Do diets with primarily or exclusively uncooked foods have health benefits?,"['Whether raw food followers suffer a heart attack or stroke less often, need less medication or live longer overall, can not be derived from this.', 'Conclusion A health benefit of raw food, which goes beyond an increased consumption of vegetable foods, has not been conclusively proven.', 'Rather, there are indications that strict raw food diets may also have a negative impact on health – similar to other diets that severely restrict food selection.']",1,"The claim that diets with primarily or exclusively uncooked foods have health benefits is challenged by the lack of conclusive evidence showing a significant advantage beyond increased vegetable consumption, and the possibility of negative health impacts from strict raw food diets.","In studies, we have not been able to find convincing evidence that raw foods provide health benefits over healthy diets that include cooked foods. On the contrary, there is also evidence of possible harm."

Is there a health risk from metal contaminants in lipsticks?,"['Risk in individual cases unclear The cited study by the team led by study leader Liu [1] analysed 32 products on their metal content.', 'The small amounts of lipstick thus do not lead to an increased risk of poisoning.', 'If the use of lipsticks is therefore a health risk when used very frequently, only more detailed and extensive studies can show.']",1,"The claim that there is a health risk from metal contaminants in lipsticks is uncertain because while the small amounts of lipstick used do not pose an immediate risk, more extensive studies are needed to determine the potential health effects of frequent use.","Several chemical analyses find traces of metals in lipsticks, which can in principle be harmful in high concentrations. However, the analyses do not examine the quantities in which the metals are actually absorbed and whether they cause damage in the body. Overall, there is still too little research into whether there could be a risk for some of the metal impurities if they are used very frequently."
"Can a dietary supplement containing omega-3 fatty acids, lipids, vitamins, and nutrients (""Souvenaid"") noticeably slow or halt the decline of mental performance in Alzheimer's disease?","['A comparison of the test values of the product and placebo groups with the end of the study shows no noticeable difference in the memory performance of the participants.', ""Two randomised-controlled studies for six to twelve months [4] and a third randomised-controlled study for 18 months [5] show that omega-3 fat-containing fish oil capsules cannot improve mental capacity in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease."", ""Whether one can prevent or delay the outbreak of Alzheimer's disease, if one regularly eats fish oil capsules, is not sufficiently investigated [6]."", ""Those who swallow preparations containing vitamin B6, B12 and folic acid should not be able to prevent mild to mild Alzheimer's disease from progressing [6].""]",2,"The claim that Souvenaid can slow or halt mental decline in Alzheimer's disease is challenged by the findings that omega-3 fatty acid supplements, similar to Souvenaid's ingredients, have shown no noticeable improvement in memory performance in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease in multiple randomized-controlled studies.",Three randomized-controlled trials show that such a dietary supplement (Souvenaid®) is unlikely to markedly slow or halt the progression of Alzheimer's dementia. Taking omega-3 fatty acid or vitamin B supplements alone also does not appear to have such an effect.
Is acupuncture for chronic pain more effective than placebo acupuncture treatment?,"['Acupuncture slightly surpasses dummy treatment A recent study is now to show that the pain-relieving effect of acupuncture exceeds that of a mere placebo effect, several media write.', 'The very thorough analysis of all these clinical studies showed that acupuncture in chronic pain was not only better than no treatment, but also slightly better than a sham acupuncture.', 'Also in fibromyalgia, a chronic pain disorder of the musculature, acupuncture probably has a slight, but hardly noticeably better effect than sham acupuncture [9].', 'Even if the mechanism of action of acupuncture is unknown and the placebo effect is partly responsible for its analgesic effect, it appears to be an interesting alternative or additional therapy for patients with chronic pain.']",0,"The claim that acupuncture is more effective than placebo acupuncture treatment for chronic pain is supported by the analysis of clinical studies and research on fibromyalgia, which consistently show a slight but noticeable advantage of acupuncture over sham acupuncture.","Acupuncture is slightly superior to sham acupuncture treatment for some types of pain. However, pain patients are unlikely to notice this difference."
Does treatment with radioactive agents help with pain in chronic inflammatory joint disease?,"['If the correct amount of a suitable radioactive substance is injected directly into the joint, the radiation causes the swollen and inflamed joint mucosa to die – after healing, a healthy skin can grow back, the inflammation is gone [1].', 'According to a 2009 overview study, success rates in small joints vary from 54 to 100 percent pain reduction 12 months after treatment, from 29 to 94 percent pain reduction in large joints [1].', 'A somewhat recent randomized-controlled study compared two drugs for radiosynoviorthesis and cortisone: after 48 weeks, the frequently used yttrium performed better than cortisone and the comparator, but only in a single point – namely on a particular pain scale.']",0,"The claim that treatment with radioactive agents helps with pain in chronic inflammatory joint disease is supported by the evidence that radioactive substances can reduce inflammation and pain in joints, with success rates ranging from 54 to 100 percent in small joints and 29 to 94 percent in large joints, and a recent study showing that yttrium outperformed cortisone in reducing pain on a particular scale.","Depending on the cause of the pain, radiosynoviorthesis can lead to considerable pain reduction, as confirmed by a 2009 review. However, it is not proven whether the treatment is more effective than cortisone treatment."
"Did oseltamivir (Tamiflu®) or other neuraminidase inhibitors help reduce deaths from the H1N1 influenza virus (""swine flu"" virus)?","['It is striking that the raw data do not show a significant difference in the death rate between neuraminidase inhibitors and untreated patients.', 'Tamiflu alone did not investigate whether the Tamiflu active substance oseltamivir saved lives during the H1N1 pandemic was not investigated separately in the study funded by the Tamiflu manufacturer.']",1,"The claim that oseltamivir or other neuraminidase inhibitors helped reduce deaths from the H1N1 influenza virus is uncertain because the raw data does not show a significant difference in the death rate between treated and untreated patients, and the study funded by the manufacturer did not investigate this specific question.","Previously published analyses of data from the H1N1 influenza (""swine flu"") pandemic period are of insufficient quality to answer this question."
Do rising temperatures and CO2 levels increase the risk of pollen allergy?,"['It is unclear whether the increase in CO2 has already caused a noticeable increase in the amount of pollen released.', 'Influence on allergy risk unclear However, whether the increasing pollen exposure also increases the risk of developing pollen allergy for non-allergic agents is unclear.', 'Whether higher levels of pollen increase the probability of hay fever is so far unclear [5].', 'There is nothing to read about pollen becoming more aggressive in so far published studies.']",1,"The claim that rising temperatures and CO2 levels increase the risk of pollen allergy is uncertain due to the lack of conclusive evidence, as the available studies do not clearly establish a direct link between increased pollen exposure and the development of pollen allergy.","Rising temperatures and increased CO2 concentrations cause plants to produce larger amounts of pollen over a longer period of time. However, it is unclear whether larger amounts of pollen and a longer pollen season increase the likelihood of developing pollen allergy."
Does glucosamine prolong life?,"['This is exactly what happens once again in the article on glucosamine as a life prolonger: The study was conducted on nematodes (fade worms) and mice and in which glucosamine led to an extended life span [1].', 'The conclusion of the researchers: If glucosamine has the same effect in two different species and these processes are also conceivable in humans, then glucosamine is highly likely to prolong life expectancy in humans.', 'Yes, with many limitations There is a cohort study on humans on this question: In 2010, a first evaluation looked at the influence of 20 vitamins or dietary supplements on life expectancy [3]; of these 20 only glucosamine and chondroitin showed a possible relationship with life expectancy.', 'The researchers speculate that glucosamine prolongs life expectancy just as was found in aspirin [2].', 'Until then, the life-prolonging effect of glucosamine remains optimistic speculation with little evidence.']",0,"While some studies on nematodes, mice, and humans suggest a possible link between glucosamine and increased life expectancy, the evidence is limited and speculative, and therefore, it is uncertain whether glucosamine truly prolongs life.","Although research here is still in its infancy and there is only one cohort study in humans besides basic studies, this shows possible effects. Further studies with better methods and other groups of participants are necessary."
Does Kinesio tape help in the treatment of joint and muscle injuries?,"['Therefore, it cannot be said whether the tape could contribute to the improvement of the pain after a long period of time.', 'Overall, the efficacy of Kinesio tape in musculoskeletal pain and injuries is at best unclear.', 'Since no studies have been carried out for more than 6 days, however, nothing can be said about a possible longer-term effect of the tape.']",1,The claim that Kinesio tape helps in the treatment of joint and muscle injuries is uncertain due to the lack of long-term studies and unclear efficacy in musculoskeletal pain and injuries.,There is no evidence that kinesio tape can reduce pain within a few days. It is unclear whether taping can help improve movement restrictions caused by an injury.
Do injections with Botulinum Toxin A (Botox®) help with urinary incontinence?,"['According to the standard, Botulinum Toxin A (known as Botox®) has been approved in Ireland and possibly other European countries for the treatment of incontinence caused by multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injuries.', 'Efficacy of Botulinum Toxin A A summary of the results of 19 randomised-controlled studies, each with a relatively small number of participants, shows good efficacy [1].', ""Therefore, a single series of injections with Botulinum Toxin A in the bladder's detrusor muscle can significantly reduce the frequency of urinary loss in patients with incontinence.""]",0,"The claim that injections with Botulinum Toxin A (Botox®) help with urinary incontinence is supported by the approval of Botox® in Ireland and possibly other European countries for treating incontinence caused by multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injuries, as well as the good efficacy shown in 19 randomised-controlled studies.","Several small randomized-controlled trials show that injections of botulinum toxin A into the detrusor muscle surrounding the urinary bladder can reduce, but not completely prevent, the incidence of involuntary urinary leakage."
Can lack of sleep cause obesity?,"['So, most likely, lack of sleep is just one of many different factors that can affect weight gain.', 'Cause unclear The mere fact that people with a lack of sleep are more likely to be overweight or gain more weight than those who sleep, however, does not necessarily mean that the lack of sleep is the real cause of obesity.', 'People who sleep too little usually have an unhealthy lifestyle in general, so other factors can also play a role in increasing weight gain.', ""Whether lack of sleep actually makes you fat can't be said from previous study results – even if there is evidence that people who sleep little may become overweight rather than people with normal sleep.""]",1,"The claim that lack of sleep causes obesity is uncertain because the correlation between sleep deprivation and weight gain may be influenced by other factors, such as an unhealthy lifestyle, rather than sleep itself being the direct cause.",People who regularly get too little sleep may be more likely to be overweight than those who get enough sleep. But whether lack of sleep itself causes obesity is unclear.
Does acupuncture help against hay fever?,"['As with other acupuncture studies, it is therefore questionable whether the improvement of hay fever symptoms was due to the needle stitches themselves.', 'In order to distinguish between the placebo effect and the specific effect of acupuncture in the future, further studies with better study designs are necessary.']",1,The claim that acupuncture helps against hay fever is uncertain because the existing studies are questionable and further research with better designs is needed to determine if the improvement is due to the acupuncture itself or a placebo effect.,We have not found any meaningful studies that can provide evidence of improvement in hay fever.
Does marijuana use reduce the risk of developing diabetes?,"['Marijuana users have rare diabetes A cross-sectional study in 2012 of 10,896 US-Americans [2] revealed that marijuana consumers were less likely to suffer from diabetes.', 'However, they cannot show with certainty that the use of marijuana is actually responsible for the reduced risk of diabetes.', 'Marijuana may reduce risk factors The authors of a smaller cross-sectional study in 4657 subjects [3] found a connection between smoking marijuana and the reduced occurrence of insulin resistance, a precursor of diabetes.', 'People who regularly consumed marijuana had a 12 percent lower chance of developing insulin resistance.']",0,"The claim that marijuana use reduces the risk of developing diabetes is supported by cross-sectional studies that found a correlation between marijuana consumption and lower rates of diabetes and insulin resistance, although the causal relationship remains uncertain.",Two cross-sectional studies provide evidence for a diabetes-preventive effect of active ingredients from the cannabis plant. That the consumption of marijuana actually reduces the risk of diabetes has yet to be confirmed by extensive studies.
Can coenzyme Q10 lead to a rejuvenation of the skin's appearance?,"['No evidence of skin rejuvenation In a small study in 60 women [ 1 ], researchers investigated the effect of taking coenzyme Q10 – holding food supplement capsules for 12 weeks on the skin.']",1,"The claim that coenzyme Q10 can lead to a rejuvenation of the skin's appearance is not supported by the study, which found no evidence of skin rejuvenation in women who took coenzyme Q10 supplements for 12 weeks.","Since there are no studies on this subject conducted according to common scientific standards, this question cannot be answered."
Is there an increased risk of long-term effects on the unborn child with chemotherapy starting in the 2nd trimester of pregnancy?,"['Chemotherapy in pregnancy with possible effects Chemotherapy in pregnancy is in principle a risk to the unborn because of the toxic properties of cytostatic agents.', 'However, compared to healthy peers, more children of chemotherapy-treated mothers showed mild abnormalities of heartbeat.', 'A study [ 2 ], in which the children were accompanied for an average of over three years, found that the newborns who were exposed to chemotherapy from the second trimester of pregnancy were on average 200 grams lighter than children of cancer-sick mothers without chemotherapy treatment.', 'Conclusion The likelihood of a high accumulation of severe malformations or severe long-term effects for children who were exposed to chemotherapy from the second trimester of pregnancy appears to be low.']",0,"The claim that chemotherapy starting in the 2nd trimester of pregnancy increases the risk of long-term effects on the unborn child is not supported by the evidence, as the study found only mild abnormalities of heartbeat and a small difference in birth weight, with no indication of severe malformations or long-term effects.","Studies published to date do not suggest a greatly increased risk of adverse effects on the child, but such a risk cannot be ruled out."
Does removal and examination of the first lymph nodes after the prostate is affected by cancer (sentinel lymph nodes or sentinel lymph nodes) improve the chances of cure? (Reader Inquiry),"['In 2010, the claim that removal and examination of the guardian lymph nodes can reduce the risk of further metastases in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Another series of cases involving a little over 1000 patients [ 2 ] showed that in about two thirds of prostate cancer cases nodes were found infected with the guardian lymph node examination, which would have been disregarded at a conventional removal of most surrounding lymph nodes.']",1,"The removal and examination of sentinel lymph nodes may improve the chances of cure for prostate cancer patients, as it can reduce the risk of further metastases and detect infected nodes that would have been overlooked by conventional lymph node removal.","Removal and examination of sentinel lymph nodes helps assess the progression of prostate cancer. However, whether it improves the chances of cure cannot be said due to the low level of scientific evidence."
Do braces treatments have preventive medical benefits in addition to aesthetic ones?,"['At present, it is not yet possible to assess all the health consequences of dental regulation, neither the positive nor the negative.', 'The result was somewhat devastating for orthodontics: no studies were found to investigate long-term efficacy, nor any that dealt with general oral health: ""Whether remedying tooth defects is an effective prerequisite for maintaining natural toothing cannot be answered,"" says the summary.', 'It is not clear when there is a need for regulation at all (""research is almost completely lacking""), nor how the risk of caries or the breakdown of the tooth root are affected.', 'Adverse reactions and long-term consequences are therefore far too little researched.', 'There is no indication of a risk from regulation, nor that dental regulation can prevent or treat diseases of the jaw joints [7] [8].']",1,"The claim that braces treatments have preventive medical benefits in addition to aesthetic ones is challenged by the lack of research on long-term efficacy, general oral health, and the prevention or treatment of diseases, as well as the uncertainty surrounding the need for regulation and its potential risks.","The long-term effects of tooth straightening are still very poorly researched. Apart from obvious effects in extreme malocclusions, there is no good evidence for either medical benefit or high risk."
"What are the advantages and disadvantages of vaccinating infants simultaneously with the usual six-dose vaccine (against diphtheria, tetanus, polio, pertussis, hepatitis B, and Haemophilus influenzae B) and a pneumococcal vaccine? (Reader inquiry)","['According to a systematic review [ 1 ], the risk of adverse reactions after a combination of six-fold vaccination plus pneumococcal vaccination increases slightly.', 'In summary, the co-administration of pneumococcal and previous six-fold vaccination shows no reduced protection against the pathogens, while the risk of adverse reactions is slightly increased.']",0,"The claim that vaccinating infants simultaneously with the usual six-dose vaccine and a pneumococcal vaccine has both advantages and disadvantages is supported by the evidence that co-administration shows no reduced protection against pathogens, but slightly increases the risk of adverse reactions.","Simultaneous vaccination with pneumococcal and six-way vaccine results in essentially equivalent protection against the 6 pathogens compared with six-way vaccination alone. The somewhat increased risk of fever after vaccination is offset by additional, nearly complete protection against pneumococcal infection and infection."
Can phthalates cause diabetes?,"['The authors of two recently published studies found significantly higher concentrations of phthalates in the body in diabetic patients than in those without diabetes [1] [2].', 'No direct evidence for diabetes cause, but indications Even if there are increased concentrations of various phthalates in the body in diabetics as well as in people with a diabetes precursor – this is not proof that phthalates trigger diabetes.']",0,"The claim that phthalates can cause diabetes is not supported by direct evidence, despite higher concentrations of phthalates being found in diabetic patients, as correlation does not imply causation.","Studies conducted in humans to date show that people with diabetes or pre-diabetes have significantly elevated phthalate concentrations in their bodies. Although these studies cannot prove that diabetes is caused or contributed to by phthalates, results from laboratory studies in the test tube and in animals point in this direction.

Does a newly approved contraceptive pill with the active ingredient combination nomegestrol acetate and 17ß-estradiol have fewer undesirable side effects than other birth control pills?,"['Conclusion Although the benefits of the new pill are mentioned only cautiously in both newspaper articles, there are no scientific facts that indicate fewer side effects, lower exposure to the liver or a reduced risk of thrombosis.', 'Also, the fact that the use of natural estradiol as estrogen hormone instead of usual ethinyl estradiol has significant advantages cannot be proven from the study data.']",2,"The claim that the newly approved contraceptive pill has fewer undesirable side effects than other birth control pills is not supported by scientific facts, as the study data does not provide evidence of significant advantages or reduced risks.","Compared to two other birth control pills available in pharmacies, side effects such as acne, weight gain or headaches occur just as often or even more frequently with the newly approved pill. Even if some blood values are somewhat more favorable, it is unclear whether the slightly increased risk of thrombosis generally associated with birth control pills is actually lower with the new preparation."
Does PrEP reduce the risk of HIV infection?,['The evaluation showed that the risk of HIV infection in the PrEP users was significantly reduced.'],0,The claim that PrEP reduces the risk of HIV infection is supported by the evaluation's finding that PrEP users had a significantly reduced risk of HIV infection.,"Studies to date have confirmed the preventive effect.
