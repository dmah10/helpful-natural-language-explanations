Can probiotics lower blood sugar in type 2 diabetes?,"['And if so, can probiotics reverse this change and reduce blood sugar levels again?', 'At the most small effect, they may actually be able to.', 'However, the effect of the capsules and tablets does not seem to be large: in the previous studies, they were able to reduce the long-term sugar level HbA1c by an average of 0.55 points.']",0,"While some studies suggest probiotics may have a small effect in reducing HbA1c levels by an average of 0.55 points in type 2 diabetes, the impact of capsules and tablets does not seem to be large.","The summarized results of studies to date suggest that probiotics in capsule or tablet form could lower blood sugar somewhat. At least if they are taken over a period of two to three months. However, the effect is not well established. Probiotic dairy products and probiotic powder for dissolving do not seem to have any demonstrable effect."
"Can a bioresonance device like ""Bioscan"" or ""Vieva Vital Analyser"" measure mineral and vitamin deficiencies or detect health problems?","['This experiment clearly shows that the devices studied are completely unsuitable to diagnose a lack of vitamins or minerals.', 'Sentenced for fraud at the end of May 2022, a German court also concluded that the Bioscan device cannot fulfil the claimed claims.', 'Claims for comparable products are equally implausible.', 'Even if 1000 subjects had participated in the study and only five to six people had shown such unreliable readings, such a device would be worthless for diagnostics.']",2,"The sentences provide evidence that Bioscan and similar devices cannot accurately measure mineral and vitamin deficiencies or detect health problems, as concluded by a German court and demonstrated in an experiment.","An experiment shows that the devices cannot distinguish between healthy people, seriously ill people and a corpse. The claimed mode of action behind the measurement method is also scientifically implausible. A German court has convicted the manufacturers of the Bioscan device (not legally binding) of fraud."
Will women who have recurrent bladder infections get rid of them faster if they take cranberry products only after the disease is already there???,"['There is also only evidence that cranberry products can prevent bladder inflammation for otherwise healthy women.', 'However, there does not seem to be any meaningful studies that have investigated this in women with recurrent bladder inflammation.', 'The preventive effect of cranberry in children, men and people with urinary catheters or certain diseases has not been studied.']",1,"The claim cannot be supported or refuted because there is no meaningful study that has investigated the effect of cranberry products on women with recurrent bladder infections, as stated in the sentences.","Women who repeatedly have to deal with bladder infections might become ill somewhat less frequently if they regularly take cranberry juice or extract. However, this is not well established. And it only applies to uncomplicated bladder infections in otherwise healthy women. Whether cranberry products help when cystitis is already present remains unclear. This has not yet been investigated in meaningful studies."
Can extract from St. John's wort relieve the symptoms of depression? Is it similarly effective as drugs against depression (antidepressants)?,"[""St John's wort: effective in mild to moderate depression Probably yes."", ""In mild to moderate depression, St John's wort preparations probably work better than placebo."", ""St John's wort preparations are probably as good as antidepressants."", ""St. John's wort and antidepressants can relieve the discomfort, but the depression can probably not cure for good.""]",0,"The claim is supported by the sentences stating that St. John's wort is likely effective in mild to moderate depression, works better than a placebo, and is as good as antidepressants, although it may not cure depression permanently.",St. John's wort is likely to relieve the symptoms of mild to moderate depression better than a placebo. It also appears to be similarly effective to approved medications for depression (antidepressants). St. John's wort preparations are generally better tolerated than antidepressants.
Does pine wood improve sleep?,"['So there is no indication that the pine wood improves sleep.', 'The importance of these laboratory measurements for the sleep of the participants is unclear – even if the researchers interpret them as positive effects of the circling bed.', 'Whether a pine bed actually improves sleep would have to study more rigorous studies carried out according to scientific criteria on significantly more subjects in the future.The studies in detail [1,2] Grote et al.']",1,"While some studies suggest positive effects of pine wood on sleep quality, the first sentence directly refutes the claim that pine wood improves sleep, stating there is no indication of such an effect.","So far, only one small study has investigated this question. However, the results of this study are not conclusive due to numerous deficiencies in the conduct of the study."
Does high-dose vitamin D slow down the course of disease in multiple sclerosis (MS)?,"['However, such observations alone are not sufficient to actually demonstrate the benefit of highly dosed vitamin D in MS.   Studies on vitamin D in MS We have therefore been looking for meaningful studies on the high-dose treatment of vitamin D in multiple sclerosis.', 'At present, we cannot say for sure whether highly dosed vitamin D actually brings benefits to MS.', 'However, the data so far suggest that an effect, if any, would be rather small.']",1,"The data so far suggests that any potential effect of high-dose vitamin D on MS would be small, and there is no definitive evidence of significant benefits.","We can neither clearly exclude nor confirm that there is an effect. In a total of 15 studies, no benefit could be demonstrated for high-dose vitamin D in adults with multiple sclerosis. Because the studies had many weaknesses, we cannot draw any conclusions about positive or negative effects."
Do herbal remedies with nasturtium and horseradish alleviate the symptoms of cystitis as well as an antibiotic???,"['The antibiotic alleviated the discomfort faster than the product with capuchin cress and horseradish, after eight days there was no difference.', 'Therefore, the herbal agent is not likely to be a full substitute for an antibiotic.']",1,"The antibiotic alleviated cystitis symptoms faster than the herbal remedy containing nasturtium and horseradish, suggesting that herbal agents may not be a complete substitute for antibiotics in treating cystitis.","As for prevention, we have found only one small but somewhat reliable study. According to this, nasturtium-horseradish remedies probably cannot prevent cystitis. For the treatment of cystitis, we were also only able to evaluate one study. However, it leaves too many questions unanswered to be able to clearly assess its effectiveness."
Does honey help against acute cough in children?,"['Probably effective – a little It turned out that honey as an anti-cough remedy is likely to have a certain justification.', 'With honey, the severity of the cough was about 2 points better the next day.', 'Thus, honey can obviously help children with acute cough a little by reducing discomfort and shortening their duration.', 'The shortening of the cough duration was also noticeable, but not spectacular: it was reduced from a good 5 days (with placebo) to about four and a half days (with honey).', 'Thus, honey is likely to have a positive effect both on the duration of coughing and on the symptoms associated with coughing, albeit on a modest scale.']",0,"The claim that honey helps against acute cough in children is supported by the findings that honey can reduce cough severity and shorten its duration to a modest extent, as indicated in the sentences.","Honey should help children with acute cough: The coughing attacks are likely to become somewhat less frequent, weaker and less distressing. Children's and parents' sleep may also improve, and the time to resolution is likely to be a little shorter. However, the effects achieved are only small."
Can Artemisia tea cure malaria as well as drugs?,"['And even if there were no problems with resistance – it is questionable whether Artemisia remedies from non-professional self-cultivation could reliably compete with the standardized quality of artemisinin drugs.', 'Based on the studies available to us, we can neither clearly demonstrate nor completely exclude the benefit of Artemisia tea for sustainable malaria treatment with low relapse probability.']",1,"While some studies suggest a potential benefit of Artemisia tea for malaria treatment, they do not provide clear evidence of its effectiveness compared to standard artemisinin drugs, particularly when the tea is self-cultivated.","Four studies with a total of relatively few participants come to contradictory results. Since all studies have problems, we cannot draw any meaningful conclusions about the healing success - i.e., we can neither confirm nor exclude a positive lasting effect."
Does Chaga mushroom help against cancer or other diseases?,"['Such study results cannot say anything concrete about the effect in the human body.', 'It is therefore impossible to answer whether the chaga mushroom can cure or prevent diseases.']",1,The study results do not provide a definitive answer on Chaga mushroom's ability to cure or prevent diseases in the human body.,The effect of Chaga mushrooms has not yet been investigated in studies with humans.
Does magnetic resonance therapy improve complaints of knee osteoarthritis or herniated discs (e.g. pain)?,"['Their results, however, raise doubts about the effect of nuclear resonance therapy against pain and other complaints.', 'None of the studies showed a pain-relieving effect.', 'Twelve weeks later, according to the team of authors, there were no differences in pain, daily limitations and quality of life between the treatment group and the control group.']",2,"The sentences provide evidence that magnetic resonance therapy does not have a pain-relieving effect for knee osteoarthritis or herniated discs, as there were no differences in pain and other symptoms between the treatment and control groups after 12 weeks.","Previous studies of MBST nuclear magnetic resonance therapy have shown no difference from sham treatment - suggesting that the treatment does not help. However, this judgment cannot be well supported due to the lack of power of the studies."
Are oral zinc supplements effective for treating a cold (chill)?,"['But according to the current state of knowledge, zinc preparations may help adults [1] to recover a little faster.', 'According to previous studies [1], adults taking zinc could reduce the duration of their cold by around one and a half days.', 'According to the summarized study results, the intake of zinc supplements in adults could reduce the duration of the disease by 1.8 days.', 'Consequently, it may be worth taking zinc supplements for adults if they want to significantly reduce the duration of the disease.']",0,"The claim is supported by the sentences, as multiple studies suggest that zinc supplements can help adults recover faster and reduce the duration of a cold by up to 1.8 days.","It is possible that oral zinc supplements may slightly shorten the duration of a cold in adults. However, many details concerning efficacy and safety are still unclear. Studies to date cannot answer the question of whether zinc also has a preventive effect - they are not conclusive enough."
Do probiotics alleviate the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome?,"['Thus, probiotics as a whole could possibly help with irritable bowels.', 'With probiotics there was relief in just under half, with placebo in only one third.', 'Although the probiotics usually cut off better than the sham medication, the effect was very small.']",0,"The sentences suggest that probiotics may provide relief for irritable bowel syndrome, with a slightly better outcome than placebo, but the effect is small.","Three summaries of the best available studies consistently found a small effect. However, it is unclear whether the computationally ""visible"" effect is actually noticeable for people with irritable bowel syndrome. There is also evidence that not all studies have been published."
Can echinacea protect against Sars-CoV-2 infection or help treat covid-19?,"['Even if Echinacea could help against a number of cold viruses, this would not yet prove that it also helps with Covid-19.', 'The European Medicines Agency (EMA) therefore advises from an application up to the age of 12 years and in pregnant women from [3].The studies in detail Despite extensive research in the research databases Pubmed, Cochrane Library and Epistemonikos, we could not find clinical studies with human participants in which the effectiveness of Echinacea was investigated to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection.']",1,"The claim is not supported by the evidence, as there are no clinical studies with human participants demonstrating Echinacea's effectiveness in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection.",There are no clinical studies on the prevention of Covid-19. The only study on the treatment of Covid-19 does not allow an assessment due to numerous shortcomings.
Do dietary supplements with magnesium and/or zinc improve symptoms in children with ADHD?,"['Studies on Magnesium For the benefit of magnesium in ADHD, we have not found a randomized controlled study.', 'In addition, there are further shortcomings, which is why the studies are not meaningful: In one study [1] all children received treatment with certain psychopharmaceuticals, which no longer corresponds to the current state of science.', 'The results of the studies are contradictory: two studies [5.6] suggested a positive effect of zinc.', 'In three other studies [3, 4, 7] there were no differences between the zinc and control groups.']",1,"The claim cannot be supported with the provided sentences, as there is no randomized controlled study on magnesium's benefits for ADHD, and studies on zinc show contradictory results.","For magnesium, we did not find any meaningful studies. For zinc, we were able to identify several studies that appear interesting at first glance. However, the studies are deficient, contradictory and possibly not transferable to the situation in Europe. Therefore, we cannot derive any definite statements."
"Can the ""Miracle Mineral Supplement"" MMS (sodium chlorite) cure diseases or alleviate ailments?","['No meaningful studies on MMS There is no evidence that MMS can cure diseases or relieve discomfort.', 'However, there is not the slightest indication that MMS could help against cancer or any other disease such as an infection with coronaviruses.', 'However, this study is so poor that its published results are not meaningful.', 'We doubt, for many reasons, that the reported results can be translated into ""real life"": it is questionable whether the two groups were comparable at the beginning of the study – for example, whether they were equally seriously ill or had an equally high risk of a serious disease.']",1,"The sentences provide no meaningful evidence to support the claim that MMS can cure diseases or alleviate ailments, and instead raise doubts about its effectiveness, particularly against cancer or coronaviruses.","Experts around the world warn against the use of MMS. In several cases, the agent has caused severe poisoning. Claims about a healing effect are untenable rumors. There is no evidence that the substance is effective against autism, malaria, cancer, AIDS or hepatitis, or that it helps with an infection with the coronavirus (Covid-19)."
Does regular gargling with antimicrobial mouthwashes protect against contracting coronavirus? Does it help get better faster if you have Covid 19 disease?,"['We also wanted to know if people with Covid-19 have less complaints and easier procedures when gurgling regularly.', ""We couldn't find any completed studies on this.""]",1,"The claim cannot be supported or refuted with the provided sentences, as there are no completed studies on the effects of regular gargling with antimicrobial mouthwashes on Covid-19 complaints or procedures.","Antimicrobial mouthwashes can reduce the amount of corona viruses in the mouth and throat. However, it is not certain that this will result in a faster resolution of the symptoms of covid 19 disease. There are no studies on this yet. The same applies to the preventive effect of regular gargling with mouth rinses. Theoretically, however, there are many arguments against efficacy."
Do self-performed nasal drill tests in symptom-free individuals detect coronavirus infection as reliably as professionally performed rapid tests using swabs from the nasopharynx?,"['The rather sobering result of the only study that we could find: 10 complaints-free, infected persons do the nose drill test, then this should overlook the infection in 6 to 9 cases [1].', 'About three quarters of the symptomless infections are likely to remain unrecognized.', 'The swab from the nasal throat with subsequent evaluation by the PCR is currently the most reliable method to detect Coronavirus infection [3].The studies in detail Nose drilling instead of professional fast tests?']",1,"While a study suggests that self-performed nasal drill tests may miss up to 6 to 9 infected, asymptomatic cases, professional rapid tests using nasopharynx swabs remain the most reliable detection method for coronavirus infection.","The nasal drill test is said to be less complicated and less unpleasant than the rapid test with a deep swab from the nasopharynx. However, it is unclear whether both test methods provide similarly reliable results. To date, there has been no direct comparison of self-performed nasal drill testing and rapid nasopharyngeal testing by trained personnel.  Comparisons with the PCR test, currently the most reliable coronavirus detection method, however, show: In people without covid-19 symptoms, the nasal pick test is rather unreliable. About three quarters of infections could be missed."
Does CBD help with sleep disorders?,"['The impact of CBD on sleep has not yet been seriously investigated [7].', 'They have not investigated whether CBD regularly ingested over a long period of time helps with sleep disorders.', 'Whether the participants fell asleep with CBD earlier and their sleep was deeper, the research team did not measure intelligibly.', 'Differences in sleep effects between CBD and dummy preparation could not be discovered by the research group in its study.']",1,"The research team did not find evidence to support or refute the claim that CBD helps with sleep disorders, as they did not measure sleep onset or depth, or compare CBD to a placebo over a long period.",We could not find any meaningful studies on this question.
Does Spirulina help with obesity?,"['Without foundation is also the claim that Spirulina can increase heart health and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.', 'That Spirulina can help with diabetes is another myth.', ""For none of Spirulina's health claims there are meaningful studies that can demonstrate an effect."", 'Whether Spirulina can help with weight loss can therefore neither be proved nor refuted.']",1,"The claim that Spirulina helps with obesity is not supported by any meaningful studies, as stated in the sentences, and no evidence is presented to prove or refute its effect on weight loss.","According to various studies, spirulina is supposed to help with asthma, allergies, diabetes or even chronic pain, reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease or help with weight loss. However, due to serious flaws, the results of these studies are not trustworthy."
Does spirulina have a health-promoting effect???,"['Without foundation is also the claim that Spirulina can increase heart health and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.', 'That Spirulina can help with diabetes is another myth.', 'Myth Variety Many other effects are attributed to the Spirulina algae, but for none of them there is evidence in the form of reliable data.', ""For none of Spirulina's health claims there are meaningful studies that can demonstrate an effect."", 'Whether Spirulina can help with weight loss can therefore neither be proved nor refuted.']",1,"The claim that spirulina has a health-promoting effect is not supported by any meaningful studies, and there is no reliable data to back up its role in improving heart health, reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease, helping with diabetes, aiding in weight loss, or providing any other health benefits.","According to various studies, spirulina is supposed to help with asthma, allergies, diabetes or even chronic pain, reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease or help with weight loss. However, due to serious flaws, the results of these studies are not trustworthy."
Does treatment with focused high-intensity ultrasound (HIFU) reduce abdominal girth?,"['Ultrasound treatment – if at all – should not have a great effect.', 'Twelve weeks after the end of treatment, the abdominal circumference at the waist was one centimetre lower than after a dummy treatment without ultrasound.', 'Compared to the sham treatment, it detected a reduction of one centimetre in the group with the highest ultrasonic intensity.']",0,"The first sentence suggests no significant effect of ultrasound treatment on abdominal girth, while the second and third sentences describe a reduction of one centimeter in the treatment group compared to the sham treatment, providing evidence against the initial claim.","In a study with low significance, the abdominal circumference at the waist decreased by 1 cm after 3 months. In our estimation, this uncertain effect is very small or hardly visible."
Does focused ultrasound (HIFU) treatment reduce wrinkles and sagging of the skin?,"['Unproven allegation However, there is no scientific evidence of this effect.', 'However, we could not find such studies – despite extensive research in several research databases.', 'What we have found are studies with very low significance, which have compared only different HIFU treatment strengths [1-3].', 'They cannot answer whether the HIFU method does anything.']",1,"While some studies have compared different strengths of HIFU treatment, they do not provide sufficient evidence to determine whether the HIFU method reduces wrinkles and sagging of the skin.","We did not find any conclusive studies. So whether HIFU has a visible effect is not solidly studied. However, there are reports of significant pain, redness and swelling."
Do curd compresses have an analgesic effect (e.g. for muscle and joint pain)? Do they have an antipyretic effect? Do curd compresses help breastfeeding women with lactation congestion?,"['Nine years later, we too could not find meaningful research results on pot wrapping during an extensive research.', 'But it is unclear whether pots also have a benefit.', 'The fact that a quark pack helps just as well as a cool pack, however, cannot be shown by the examination – because it is too deficient.', 'However, how well they actually relieve pain and swelling is not well studied [3,4].', 'It is also unclear how pot wraps are supposed to relieve pain and inflammation.']",1,"While some studies suggest that quark packs can be as effective as cool packs for pain and swelling relief, there is a lack of well-studied evidence on the specific benefits of curd compresses or pot wrapping for pain, inflammation, antipyretic effects, or lactation congestion relief, making it unclear how they are supposed to help.",We could not find any conclusive studies on curd wraps. Whether the effect goes beyond a cooling effect is unclear.
Do people with blood group AB have a higher risk of developing dementia?,"['The result: None of the four known blood groups were remarkably common among people with dementia.', 'The four blood groups A, B, AB and 0 were similarly distributed among dementia patients as among the healthy average population.', 'Blood type AB: no panic However, bad results in thinking and memory tasks do not automatically mean that dementia begins.', 'The study therefore provides no indication that the blood type was directly responsible for the mental impairments.', 'The direct conclusion that blood type AB increases the risk of mental impairment is not confirmed by the results.']",2,"The study's findings indicate that blood group distribution is similar among dementia patients and the general population, providing no evidence to directly link blood type AB to an increased risk of dementia.","The risk of dementia appears to be similar for people of all four blood groups (A, B, AB, 0). This was shown by two studies that evaluated data from more than 9,000 affected individuals. The claim spread in the media that the AB blood group increases the risk of dementia is therefore unlikely to be true."
Does biotin help with hair loss? Does biotin make hair grow faster?,"['Unclear effect on hair loss and hair growth Our search for scientific evidence for the claimed effects of biotin remained unsuccessful.', 'We can neither answer whether Biotin makes hair grow faster, nor can the vitamin stop hair loss.', 'The scientists found no difference in hair growth between the biotin and placebo groups [1].', 'Evidence still has to be provided Whether biotin is effective or ineffective, we cannot say on this basis.', 'The study concluded that the intake of biotin had no effect on hair growth.']",1,"The claim cannot be supported as the evidence shows no difference in hair growth between biotin and placebo groups, and there is no proof of biotin's effectiveness or ineffectiveness in stopping hair loss.","The number of studies dealing with the effect of biotin on hair growth is insufficient. According to current research, a positive effect has not been confirmed."
Is mannose as good as or better than antibiotics for preventing recurrent cystitis?,"['Overall, therefore, there is no certainty at this stage whether mannosis is actually effective and safe when it comes to preventing bladder inflammation.', 'Therefore, it is not certain whether mannosis is actually better tolerated than an antibiotic.']",1,"The sentences do not provide evidence that mannose is as good as or better than antibiotics for preventing recurrent cystitis, and there is no certainty about its effectiveness or tolerability compared to antibiotics.","In two studies, bladder infections occurred with a similar frequency or even less frequently with mannose than with an antibiotic. However, the studies are so poorly done that the results are not trustworthy."
Does taking vitamin K lower the risk of spinal fractures in older women?,"['No benefit – or at most a small one The results of the studies, however, are rather disappointing: vertebral fractures could not be safely prevented with vitamin K. In the case of fractures on other bones, the overall benefit was small: without vitamin K, 30 out of 1000 people had broken bones.']",2,"The studies indicate that vitamin K does not safely prevent spinal fractures and offers only a small benefit for fractures on other bones, which contradicts the claim of lowering the risk of spinal fractures in older women.","Taking vitamin K probably does not reduce the risk of vertebral fractures. However, this assessment is not well supported. The risk of other bone fractures could possibly be reduced - but only slightly. This estimate is also subject to some uncertainty."
Can red mold rice products lower blood cholesterol levels?,"['The summarized results of previous studies show that redhead rice probably has a favourable influence on high cholesterol levels [1,2].', 'According to analysis, redhead rice products can reduce elevated cholesterol levels similarly well as the common medicine simvastatin.', ""Again, the author's team found indications that the rice products can have a beneficial influence on cholesterol levels.""]",0,"The summarized results of previous studies and the author's team's findings suggest that red mold rice products may have a positive impact on high cholesterol levels, similar to the common medicine simvastatin.","Red mold rice naturally contains the substance lovastatin, which acts as a cholesterol-lowering agent. The concentration of lovastatin in products made from red mold rice can vary greatly. Therefore, it is not certain that red mold rice is as effective as drugs containing a controlled amount of lovastatin. Depending on the dosage, undesirable side effects from red mold rice are possible - just as with the ""real"" drugs."
Do essential oils protect against corona infections and other viral infections like colds or flu?,"['There was no difference between those who swallowed the oils and those who took a sham medication (placebo).', 'In addition, we could not find any studies that investigated the effect of essential oils directly on humans.', 'It is questionable whether a room air treated with essential oils can prevent them.']",1,"The claim that essential oils protect against corona infections and other viral infections is not supported by the provided sentences, as there is no direct evidence in human studies and the impact of room air treatment with essential oils is questionable.","In laboratory tests, some essential oils can successfully kill viruses. Whether spraying, inhaling or swallowing the oils also protects against infections with viruses such as the Corona virus in real life is unclear. It has not been scientifically studied yet."
"Does propolis have a preventive or soothing effect against infection with coronavirus, colds or flu?","['Scientifically meaningful evidence of an infection-preventing effect of Propolis could not be found despite intensive search.', 'Because so far studies have not investigated whether the use of Propolis can protect against the Coronavirus.', 'However, it is not possible to conclude that Propolis alone is effective from a combination product.', 'However, the fact that the use of Propolis can also prevent viral infections is a fallacy.']",1,"The claim that propolis has a preventive or soothing effect against infection with coronavirus, colds or flu is not supported by the provided sentences, as there is no scientific evidence of its infection-preventing effect and it is not proven to protect against the Coronavirus.","To date, there are no studies that have investigated the effect of propolis in these viral infections."
Does LOW dose atropine (0.05% or less) sustainably inhibit the progression of myopia in children???,"['Therefore, the study cannot answer how well atropine works at a concentration of 0.01% or 0.1%.']",1,The study does not provide information on the effectiveness of atropine at concentrations of 0.01% or 0.1% in inhibiting myopia progression in children.,"Drip-feeding high-dose atropine for 1-3 years probably inhibits the progression of myopia in the short term. If dripping is done daily, the effect does not seem to be noticeable 1 year after the end of treatment. If dripping is done monthly at first and then every 2 months, the effect is likely to last longer. Whether lower-dose atropine helps in the long term is poorly understood."
Can therapy with EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) alleviate the symptoms of people with post-traumatic stress disorder?,"['Probably effective Our research revealed that people with post-traumatic stress disorder are probably better off after a psychotherapy with EMDR than people who have not received any psychotherapeutic treatment at all.', 'Our conclusion With EMDR therapy, post-traumatic stress disorder is likely to improve more than completely without therapy.', 'That they are effective has been shown in well conducted studies [1].Studies in detail Since the 1990s, the topic of trauma therapy has been intensively researched using EMDR.', 'The result: with EMDR therapy, the subjects had less complaints than without any treatment.']",0,"The claim is supported by the sentences, as they indicate that EMDR therapy has been shown to improve symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder compared to no treatment.",Therapy with EMDR is probably more effective than no therapy at all for people suffering from the psychological consequences of a traumatic experience. Its effectiveness may be similar to that of exposure therapy. This is a widely established and well-studied form of psychotherapy.
Does the additional offer of HIV self-testing cause more people to take an HIV test?,"['HIV self-tests are attractive Overall, the nine international studies conclude that the supply of HIV self-tests is likely to lead to more people passing an HIV test.', 'Thus, an extended range of self-tests is likely to lead to more people taking an HIV test globally.', 'Apparently, the supply of HIV self-tests leads to more tests, especially in those groups, which make little use of the already existing offer.']",0,"The consensus from nine international studies indicates that an increased availability of HIV self-tests may result in more people getting tested, particularly those who are currently underutilizing existing testing options.","Current research provides very strong evidence that the addition of HIV self-testing leads to more people taking an HIV test. Among others, people for whom testing at health facilities by professionals is not acceptable for various reasons also make use of this offer."
Can injecting stem cells into the knee joint relieve pain and limitations associated with osteoarthritis?,"['Whether the therapy can appreciably relieve pain and movement restrictions in case of knee arthritis remains unclear [1].', 'Our conclusion: At the moment, the therapy with stem cells in the case of arthrosis in the knee is not matured.', 'Because whether the stem cells arrived in the knee actually do what they should do and form new cartilage is also uncertain.', 'Effect probably not noticeable The result: according to statistical analysis, the test subjects from the stem cell group had less pain on average.']",1,"While some statistical analysis suggests a slight reduction in pain for those with knee osteoarthritis who received stem cell therapy, the unclear arrival and functionality of stem cells in the knee joint, as well as the therapy's overall immaturity, do not provide a clear answer to the claim.",It is unclear whether stem cells injected into the knee for osteoarthritis have a curative effect.  Possible side effects and dangers are also insufficiently researched.
Can an extract of Desmodium promote liver health or relieve other ailments?,"['Whether desmodium improves the function of the liver or even heals liver damage, has apparently not been researched in meaningful studies.', 'The studies in detail We could not find meaningful studies on Desmodium.']",1,"The claim that Desmodium extract can promote liver health or alleviate other ailments is not supported by the provided sentences, as there is a lack of meaningful studies investigating its effects on the liver.",We found no conclusive studies on the efficacy of Desmodium - neither on liver health nor for any other application.

Can healing clay help with gastritis?,"['Despite intensive research in several research databases, we could not find meaningful studies in which the effect of healing soil was investigated.', 'Thus, there is no evidence that healing earth relieves problems with gastritis.', 'The studies in detail We could not find meaningful studies on the effect of healing soil in gastritis.']",1,"The claim that healing clay can help with gastritis is not supported by any meaningful studies, as indicated in the provided sentences.",We could not find a meaningful study that scientifically examined this question.
Do heat patches containing capsaicin help with neck pain???,"['The study team reported that people who wear a capsaicin-containing heat patch four weeks a day have just as much (or little) neck pain as people with a placebo patch without an active substance.', 'Further studies with a larger number of participants must confirm whether heat patches with capsaicin are actually ineffective.', 'This indicates that the patches with capsaicin do not have any special analgesic effect.']",2,"The study reports that people using capsaicin-containing heat patches experienced similar neck pain levels as those with placebo patches, suggesting no special analgesic effect of the capsaicin patches.",Studies on the pain-relieving effect of heat pads and self-heating plasters are contradictory.
Do heat patches help with lower back pain?,"['This substance creates a feeling of warmth on the skin, but does not become warm itself.', 'According to their results, it is likely that both types of heat patches can relieve pain in the lower back.', 'Carrying self-warming patches for three days has on average improved the pain in the lower back by 18 points on the 100s scale [1].', 'In addition to movement exercises or painkillers, the heat patches are probably pain-relieving [1,3].']",0,"The claim is supported by a study showing an average 18-point reduction in lower back pain after three days of using self-warming patches, and additional research suggesting they are pain-relieving when used with other treatments. However, the first sentence about the substance not warming itself does not provide direct evidence of pain relief.","Heat patches produce heat by means of a chemical reaction. They can probably relieve low back pain somewhat in the short term. However, this has only been investigated for complaints that have persisted for a maximum of 3 months...

"Can a dietary supplement containing omega-3 fatty acids, lipids, vitamins, and nutrients (""Souvenaid"") noticeably slow or halt the decline of mental performance in Alzheimer's disease?","['A comparison of the test values of the product and placebo groups with the end of the study shows no noticeable difference in the memory performance of the participants.', ""Two randomised-controlled studies for six to twelve months [4] and a third randomised-controlled study for 18 months [5] show that omega-3 fat-containing fish oil capsules cannot improve mental capacity in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease."", ""Whether one can prevent or delay the outbreak of Alzheimer's disease, if one regularly eats fish oil capsules, is not sufficiently investigated [6]."", ""Those who swallow preparations containing vitamin B6, B12 and folic acid should not be able to prevent mild to mild Alzheimer's disease from progressing [6].""]",2,"The studies provide no evidence that Souvenaid, a dietary supplement containing omega-3 fatty acids, lipids, vitamins, and nutrients, can slow or halt the decline of mental performance in Alzheimer's disease, as there is no significant difference in memory performance between the product and placebo groups, and omega-3 fat-containing fish oil capsules have not shown improvement in mental capacity in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, vitamin B6, B12, and folic acid preparations do not prevent the progression of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.",Three randomized-controlled trials show that such a dietary supplement (Souvenaid®) is unlikely to markedly slow or halt the progression of Alzheimer's dementia. Taking omega-3 fatty acid or vitamin B supplements alone also does not appear to have such an effect.
Is acupuncture for chronic pain more effective than placebo acupuncture treatment?,"['Acupuncture slightly surpasses dummy treatment A recent study is now to show that the pain-relieving effect of acupuncture exceeds that of a mere placebo effect, several media write.', 'The very thorough analysis of all these clinical studies showed that acupuncture in chronic pain was not only better than no treatment, but also slightly better than a sham acupuncture.', 'Also in fibromyalgia, a chronic pain disorder of the musculature, acupuncture probably has a slight, but hardly noticeably better effect than sham acupuncture [9].', 'Even if the mechanism of action of acupuncture is unknown and the placebo effect is partly responsible for its analgesic effect, it appears to be an interesting alternative or additional therapy for patients with chronic pain.']",0,"While some studies suggest a slight advantage of acupuncture over placebo acupuncture in chronic pain relief, the analgesic effect of acupuncture may also be partly due to the placebo effect, making it an interesting alternative or additional therapy.","Acupuncture is slightly superior to sham acupuncture treatment for some types of pain.

Do rising temperatures and CO2 levels increase the risk of pollen allergy?,"['It is unclear whether the increase in CO2 has already caused a noticeable increase in the amount of pollen released.', 'Influence on allergy risk unclear However, whether the increasing pollen exposure also increases the risk of developing pollen allergy for non-allergic agents is unclear.', 'Whether higher levels of pollen increase the probability of hay fever is so far unclear [5].', 'There is nothing to read about pollen becoming more aggressive in so far published studies.']",1,"While there is evidence suggesting that increased pollen exposure may not necessarily increase the risk of developing pollen allergy for non-allergic individuals, the relationship between rising temperatures, CO2 levels, and pollen aggressiveness remains unclear due to a lack of relevant studies.","Rising temperatures and increased CO2 concentrations cause plants to produce larger amounts of pollen over a longer period of time. However, it is unclear whether larger amounts of pollen and a longer pollen season increase the likelihood of developing pollen allergy."
Does glucosamine prolong life?,"['This is exactly what happens once again in the article on glucosamine as a life prolonger: The study was conducted on nematodes (fade worms) and mice and in which glucosamine led to an extended life span [1].', 'The conclusion of the researchers: If glucosamine has the same effect in two different species and these processes are also conceivable in humans, then glucosamine is highly likely to prolong life expectancy in humans.', 'Yes, with many limitations There is a cohort study on humans on this question: In 2010, a first evaluation looked at the influence of 20 vitamins or dietary supplements on life expectancy [3]; of these 20 only glucosamine and chondroitin showed a possible relationship with life expectancy.', 'The researchers speculate that glucosamine prolongs life expectancy just as was found in aspirin [2].', 'Until then, the life-prolonging effect of glucosamine remains optimistic speculation with little evidence.']",0,"While some studies suggest a possible relationship between glucosamine and life expectancy in nematodes and mice, human cohort studies provide limited evidence, and the life-prolonging effect remains speculative.","Although research here is still in its infancy and there is only one cohort study in humans besides basic studies, this shows possible effects.

Do injections with Botulinum Toxin A (Botox®) help with urinary incontinence?,"['According to the standard, Botulinum Toxin A (known as Botox®) has been approved in Ireland and possibly other European countries for the treatment of incontinence caused by multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injuries.', 'Efficacy of Botulinum Toxin A A summary of the results of 19 randomised-controlled studies, each with a relatively small number of participants, shows good efficacy [1].', ""Therefore, a single series of injections with Botulinum Toxin A in the bladder's detrusor muscle can significantly reduce the frequency of urinary loss in patients with incontinence.""]",0,"The standard approval of Botulinum Toxin A (Botox®) in Ireland and possibly other European countries for multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injuries-related incontinence, along with the good efficacy demonstrated in several randomized-controlled studies, suggests that injections can help reduce urinary loss frequency in patients with incontinence.","Several small randomized-controlled trials show that injections of botulinum toxin A into the detrusor muscle surrounding the urinary bladder can reduce, but not completely prevent, the incidence of involuntary urinary leakage."
Can lack of sleep cause obesity?,"['So, most likely, lack of sleep is just one of many different factors that can affect weight gain.', 'Cause unclear The mere fact that people with a lack of sleep are more likely to be overweight or gain more weight than those who sleep, however, does not necessarily mean that the lack of sleep is the real cause of obesity.', 'People who sleep too little usually have an unhealthy lifestyle in general, so other factors can also play a role in increasing weight gain.', ""Whether lack of sleep actually makes you fat can't be said from previous study results – even if there is evidence that people who sleep little may become overweight rather than people with normal sleep.""]",1,"While research suggests a correlation between lack of sleep and increased likelihood of obesity, it does not definitively establish lack of sleep as the cause, as other factors associated with poor sleep habits could also contribute to weight gain.",People who regularly get too little sleep may be more likely to be overweight than those who get enough sleep. But whether lack of sleep itself causes obesity is unclear.
Does acupuncture help against hay fever?,"['As with other acupuncture studies, it is therefore questionable whether the improvement of hay fever symptoms was due to the needle stitches themselves.', 'In order to distinguish between the placebo effect and the specific effect of acupuncture in the future, further studies with better study designs are necessary.']",1,"The improvement of hay fever symptoms observed in the study may be attributed to a placebo effect rather than the needle stitches themselves, suggesting that further research with improved study designs is needed to determine the specific effect of acupuncture.",We have not found any meaningful studies that can provide evidence of improvement in hay fever.
Does marijuana use reduce the risk of developing diabetes?,"['Marijuana users have rare diabetes A cross-sectional study in 2012 of 10,896 US-Americans [2] revealed that marijuana consumers were less likely to suffer from diabetes.', 'However, they cannot show with certainty that the use of marijuana is actually responsible for the reduced risk of diabetes.', 'Marijuana may reduce risk factors The authors of a smaller cross-sectional study in 4657 subjects [3] found a connection between smoking marijuana and the reduced occurrence of insulin resistance, a precursor of diabetes.', 'People who regularly consumed marijuana had a 12 percent lower chance of developing insulin resistance.']",0,"The 2012 cross-sectional study indicates an association between marijuana use and lower diabetes prevalence, but it cannot establish causality, and a smaller study suggests marijuana may reduce insulin resistance, a diabetes precursor.",Two cross-sectional studies provide evidence for a diabetes-preventive effect of active ingredients from the cannabis plant. That the consumption of marijuana actually reduces the risk of diabetes has yet to be confirmed by extensive studies.

Is there an increased risk of long-term effects on the unborn child with chemotherapy starting in the 2nd trimester of pregnancy?,"['Chemotherapy in pregnancy with possible effects Chemotherapy in pregnancy is in principle a risk to the unborn because of the toxic properties of cytostatic agents.', 'However, compared to healthy peers, more children of chemotherapy-treated mothers showed mild abnormalities of heartbeat.', 'A study [ 2 ], in which the children were accompanied for an average of over three years, found that the newborns who were exposed to chemotherapy from the second trimester of pregnancy were on average 200 grams lighter than children of cancer-sick mothers without chemotherapy treatment.', 'Conclusion The likelihood of a high accumulation of severe malformations or severe long-term effects for children who were exposed to chemotherapy from the second trimester of pregnancy appears to be low.']",0,"While chemotherapy in pregnancy poses risks due to toxic cytostatic agents, a study found that children exposed from the second trimester were lighter on average, but the likelihood of severe malformations or long-term effects appears to be low.","Studies published to date do not suggest a greatly increased risk of adverse effects on the child, but such a risk cannot be ruled out."
Does removal and examination of the first lymph nodes after the prostate is affected by cancer (sentinel lymph nodes or sentinel lymph nodes) improve the chances of cure? (Reader Inquiry),"['In 2010, the claim that removal and examination of the guardian lymph nodes can reduce the risk of further metastases in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Another series of cases involving a little over 1000 patients [ 2 ] showed that in about two thirds of prostate cancer cases nodes were found infected with the guardian lymph node examination, which would have been disregarded at a conventional removal of most surrounding lymph nodes.']",1,"The first sentence suggests that examining sentinel lymph nodes can reduce the risk of further metastases in prostate cancer patients, and the second sentence supports this by showing that in two-thirds of prostate cancer cases, infected nodes were found through sentinel lymph node examination that would have been overlooked in a conventional removal.","Removal and examination of sentinel lymph nodes helps assess the progression of prostate cancer. However, whether it improves the chances of cure cannot be said due to the low level of scientific evidence."
Do braces treatments have preventive medical benefits in addition to aesthetic ones?,"['At present, it is not yet possible to assess all the health consequences of dental regulation, neither the positive nor the negative.', 'The result was somewhat devastating for orthodontics: no studies were found to investigate long-term efficacy, nor any that dealt with general oral health: ""Whether remedying tooth defects is an effective prerequisite for maintaining natural toothing cannot be answered,"" says the summary.', 'It is not clear when there is a need for regulation at all (""research is almost completely lacking""), nor how the risk of caries or the breakdown of the tooth root are affected.', 'Adverse reactions and long-term consequences are therefore far too little researched.', 'There is no indication of a risk from regulation, nor that dental regulation can prevent or treat diseases of the jaw joints [7] [8].']",1,"While there is a lack of research on the relationship between braces treatments and preventive medical benefits, including oral health and jaw joint diseases, current studies do not indicate a risk from regulation nor any disease-preventing or treating effects.","The long-term effects of tooth straightening are still very poorly researched.
