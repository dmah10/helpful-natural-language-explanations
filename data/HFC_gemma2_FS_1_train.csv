Can masks reduce corona infections when worn by a large proportion of the population?,"['Studies show slow spread After three years of pandemic, there are now relatively meaningful data that masks can slow down the spread of the Corona virus.', 'Surgical masks, in turn, seem to reduce the risk of infecting themselves with the corona virus.']",0,"The provided sentences suggest that masks can slow the spread of the corona virus, but they do not explicitly state whether this effect is significant enough when a large proportion of the population wears them.  
","International studies suggest that the number of corona infections decreases when many people wear masks - whether fabric, surgical or FFP2 masks. However, it is not possible to precisely quantify how great the protective effect actually is. It probably depends on the type of masks and the proportion of people who wear them."
Can homeopathic preparations with Anamirta cocculus help against dizziness?,"['But without success: We could not find any meaningful scientific evidence for effectiveness in dizziness.', 'It is now well proven by studies that homeopathic preparations usually do not work better than a sham medication (placebo) [8].', 'However, it is not well established that betahistine is effective against dizziness [11.13].', 'The fact that betahist helps with dizziness is not well documented [11, 13].']",1,"The provided sentences state that there is no scientific evidence to support the effectiveness of homeopathic preparations for dizziness.  
","We have found only one study that has investigated this. However, it is so poor that no reliable statement is possible."
Can zeolite alleviate or prevent health problems?,"['However, none of these can provide any evidence – because the studies have no significance (for reasons see section Studies in detail ).', 'It does not find an advantage for zeolite – but the results are hardly meaningful.', 'However, it is not researched whether the regular intake of zeolite can lead to a nutrient deficiency or has an undesirable effect on digestion.']",1,"The provided sentences highlight the lack of substantial research and evidence regarding the potential benefits of zeolite for alleviating or preventing health problems.  
",Studies to date cannot provide any evidence that taking zeolite prevents or alleviates complaints. A detoxifying effect is not scientifically plausible.
Does paxlovid protect unvaccinated people with risk factors from severe or even fatal covid 19 disease?,"['Patients at risk without corona vaccination appear to be well protected from serious to fatal events by Paxlovid.', 'However, it is not certain how well Paxlovid helps people who have already received corona vaccination.', 'In addition, the scientists investigated whether Paxlovid alleviated the Covid-19 symptoms, shortened the duration of the disease and reduced the need for medical treatment: Half of the participants improved the symptoms with Paxlovid after 13 days, with placebo after 15 days.', 'With Paxlovid, 14 out of 1000 participants needed medical treatment for Covid-19 within a month, with placebo 76 out of 1000.', 'Whether with or without antibodies in the blood, Paxlovid basically protected all humans from a severe course.']",0,"The provided sentences suggest that Paxlovid offers protection against severe COVID-19 outcomes for individuals at risk who are not vaccinated.  
","In a large, well-done study, paxlovid prevented hospitalizations and deaths in high-risk patients. They were unvaccinated and had contracted the delta variant. For vaccinated people, the benefit cannot be reliably estimated. This also applies to people with immunodeficiency."
"Does starting school later improve health, learning success, and quality of life in adolescents?","['However, teenagers and parents now have to be very strong: despite 27 studies involving hundreds of thousands of students, no clear results can be derived from research.', 'The problem: The studies usually come to contradictory results.', 'So until better research results are available, all troubled young people and parents will only have the option of remaining out of bed early – or to hope that, despite lack of evidence, the school management will still have an insight into it.', 'It is difficult to examine whether a later start to school will have a positive effect.', 'The Problems: Unknown Influencing Factors: If differences occur in previous-after-studies, these do not have to be due to the later start of school – they may also have been caused by other changes over the course of the study period.']",1,"Research on the impact of later school start times on adolescent health, learning, and quality of life has produced conflicting results, making it difficult to draw definitive conclusions. 
","The question has been investigated in several large studies. Due to methodological deficiencies and contradictory results, no firm conclusions can be drawn. This means that science can currently neither speak for nor against a benefit of a later school start."
Does the F.X. Mayr cure have health benefits? Can it prevent diseases or treat them?,"['Thus, the claim that the method can help with various diseases is not scientifically justified.', 'These studies cannot answer whether these changes also affect health.', 'Mayr cure or other fasting methods improve health in the long term, however, cannot be concluded.']",1,"The provided studies do not establish a clear link between the Mayr cure and improvements in health or disease prevention.  
","It is neither examined nor proven whether the special fasting method after F.X. Mayr holds, which it promises: Namely assistance with all possible illnesses of allergies, over rheumatism up to sleep disturbances. The advertised detoxification and ""purification"" of the body by the chamfering cure are besides scientifically not plausible."
Does the consumption of soy foods or soy isoflavones affect the appearance of acne skin?,"['In both cases, certain soya ingredients are responsible for the effect on the skin: the isoflavones.', 'There are two competing theories that contradict each other: according to the first theory, isoflavones confuse the hormone balance and are supposed to promote acne in this way.', 'Surprisingly, despite searching in two large databases, we could not find a study on soy products and acne – whether soy milk, soy sauce or tofu.', 'The isoflavones improved the skin appearance more than an anti-acne cream with vitamin A acid (Tretinoin).', 'Conclusion: There is currently no evidence from reliable studies that soy makes acne worse.']",1,"While there are theories about how soy isoflavones might affect acne, no studies have been found to confirm or refute this claim.  
","We could not find any meaningful studies at all on the influence of soy foods on acne. On soy isoflavones, we found two small studies of questionable quality that examined a very specific group of sufferers. Soy isoflavones improved the skin appearance somewhat. However, this result is not reliable."
Does extract from the Damiana plant (Turnera diffusa) help with erectile dysfunction?,"['Efficacy does not appear to have been studied or demonstrated.', 'The studies in detail We could not find any studies on Damiana extract against erectile dysfunction in men.', 'Studies on the product Neradin also appear to be missing.']",1,"There is no scientific evidence to support the claim that Damiana extract helps with erectile dysfunction.  
","The extract from the Damiana plant (Turnera diffusa) is advertised as a remedy for erectile dysfunction for men. However, this claimed effect on potency is by no means proven. It has apparently never been tested on humans. This also applies to homeopathic remedies such as the product Neradin."
Does regular HPV testing in addition to the recommended Pap smear detect more precancerous lesions than just the Pap smear alone?,"['According to the studies, the HPV test is likely to detect slightly more precursors of cervical cancer over several years than the PAP swab alone.', 'We are therefore relatively sure that with an additional HPV test at least a little more precursors of uterine cancer are detected than only with the PAP swab alone.']",0,"The provided sentences suggest that HPV testing, in combination with a Pap smear, may identify a slightly higher number of precancerous cervical lesions compared to Pap smears alone.  
","Regular examination of the cervix by means of PAP smear tests detects precancerous stages of the cervix in most cases in good time. This reduces the risk of developing cervical cancer. An additional HPV test every three to five years can make screening even more reliable. However, the difference should not be too great."
Can monk's pepper reduce PMS symptoms? PMS is the abbreviation for premenstrual syndrome. This refers to complaints that occur in the days before menstruation.,"['Reference to efficacy in PMS According to previous studies, monk peppers could actually help in PMS.', 'The summarized study results indicate that the symptoms with monk pepper are reduced in more patients than with a sham medication (placebo).', 'Therefore, it would be possible for monk peppers to act against PMS symptoms such as breast spacing.']",0,"The provided sentences suggest that monk pepper may have a positive impact on PMS symptoms based on studies showing symptom reduction in patients compared to a placebo.  
","In the studies to date, monk's pepper seems to relieve PMS symptoms better than a placebo. However, this is not well proven, because the studies have significant weaknesses. There is no evidence of an effect on menstrual disorders. Significant studies are lacking."
Can olive leaf extract reduce high blood pressure?,"['These studies therefore do not indicate whether olive leaf extract can help with significantly increased blood pressure.', 'Without success, however, we could not find any studies that investigated the effect of olive leaf extract on cardiovascular health.', 'However, they cannot provide clear answers.', 'It is therefore impossible to say whether olive leaves extract could have a better or worse effect with significantly increased blood pressure.']",1,"The provided studies do not offer conclusive evidence regarding the impact of olive leaf extract on blood pressure.  
","Whether olive leaf extract lowers blood pressure has been investigated in five suitable studies to date. They all found no effect or only a slight effect of the extract. The problem with this is that most of the study participants had only slightly elevated blood pressure. They cannot answer how olive leaf extract works in people with significantly elevated blood pressure (hypertension). The studies also had gross flaws, few participants, and ran for a very short time. They cannot provide reliable answers."
Do green-lipped mussel preparations improve the symptoms of osteoarthritis?,"['Studies overall not meaningful The conclusion of our research: Scientific evidence for the claimed effect is missing.', 'It is also unclear whether the measured positive effects are large enough to actually be felt by those affected.', 'Whether or not green-lipped mussel helps with osteoarthritis cannot be said at the moment.', 'However, as early as 2009, the European Food Safety Authority considered that a protective effect of the green-lipped mussel on healthy joints has not been established.', 'In our opinion, no reliable conclusions can be drawn from the studies found.']",1,"The available research does not provide conclusive evidence regarding the impact of green-lipped mussel preparations on osteoarthritis symptoms.  
","The question was examined in four small studies with serious methodological deficiencies, which also arrived at partly contradictory results. No clear conclusions can be drawn from them. The claim that green-lipped mussel helps with osteoarthritis is not scientifically proven."
Can probiotics lower blood sugar in type 2 diabetes?,"['And if so, can probiotics reverse this change and reduce blood sugar levels again?', 'At the most small effect, they may actually be able to.', 'However, the effect of the capsules and tablets does not seem to be large: in the previous studies, they were able to reduce the long-term sugar level HbA1c by an average of 0.55 points.']",0,"While some studies suggest probiotics might modestly reduce HbA1c levels, the effect size is small and further research is needed to determine if they can significantly lower blood sugar in type 2 diabetes.  
","The summarized results of studies to date suggest that probiotics in capsule or tablet form could lower blood sugar somewhat. At least if they are taken over a period of two to three months. However, the effect is not well established. Probiotic dairy products and probiotic powder for dissolving do not seem to have any demonstrable effect."
Can CBD (cannabidiol) help with migraines or other headaches?,"['Apparently, CBD has never been investigated to see if it can help with migraine seizures.', 'The claim that CBD would help with migraines or headaches is pure speculation.', 'The studies in detail Despite extensive search in three databases, we could not find any studies on CBD against migraine or other types of headache, neither for treatment nor for prevention.']",1,"The provided sentences state that no studies have been found investigating the effects of CBD on migraines or headaches.  
",There are no studies that have investigated the effectiveness of CBD against migraine. So claims that CBD can help with or prevent migraine attacks have no scientific basis. The same is true for other types of headache.
Can laser irradiation of blood by infusion needle (hemolaser treatment) relieve discomfort or help with diseases?,"['It is also unclear by what mechanism blood irradiation with bundled red light – i.e.', 'red laser – should improve health.', 'Although the authors of the three studies found [1-3] claim to have established a clear efficacy of haemolaser treatment, none of the three studies is suitable to prove this.']",1,"The provided studies do not offer conclusive evidence regarding the effectiveness of hemolaser treatment in improving health.  
",There is no scientific evidence that hemolaser treatment has a palliative or curative effect on health problems.
"In everyday life, when breathing with an FFP2 mask or ordinary mouth-nose protection, do you get as much oxygen as without a mask?","['As much oxygen as without a mask This fear is, however, unfounded, as previously conducted studies show [ 1,2 ].', 'Only in very strenuous sports (fast cycling to exhaustion) was the oxygen content in the blood with FFP2 mask slightly lower than without mask.', 'There was no difference in oxygen measurement with ordinary oral nose protection.', 'Breathing a little more strenuous The results thus contradict the rumor that masks would cause an oxygen deficiency.']",0,"Studies indicate that wearing FFP2 masks or ordinary mouth-nose protection does not significantly impact oxygen levels in the blood, except in cases of very strenuous exercise. 
","Even if breathing with a mask can feel uncomfortable: According to studies to date, you get just as much oxygen with an FFP2 mask or mouth-nose protection as without a mask. This is true even when you are moving or exerting yourself. Only very intensive sports slightly reduce the oxygen content in the blood - but too little to endanger health."
Can CBD help with period pain?,"['Because despite searching in three different databases we could not find a single study on CBD in case of regular pain.', 'Scientifically, it is not sufficiently researched whether CBD actually promotes sleep, as providers claim.', 'The studies in detail We could not find any studies that investigated whether CBD can help with normal pain – neither for treatment nor for prevention.']",1,"The provided sentences state that no studies have been found investigating the effects of CBD on regular pain, making it impossible to determine if it is helpful.  
",Whether CBD can relieve menstrual pain has apparently never been scientifically studied. We could not find any studies on this. Women who suffer from severe period pain should talk to a gynecologist about it. Diseases such as endometriosis could be behind it.
"Can a bioresonance device like ""Bioscan"" or ""Vieva Vital Analyser"" measure mineral and vitamin deficiencies or detect health problems?","['This experiment clearly shows that the devices studied are completely unsuitable to diagnose a lack of vitamins or minerals.', 'Sentenced for fraud at the end of May 2022, a German court also concluded that the Bioscan device cannot fulfil the claimed claims.', 'Claims for comparable products are equally implausible.', 'Even if 1000 subjects had participated in the study and only five to six people had shown such unreliable readings, such a device would be worthless for diagnostics.']",2,"The provided sentences state that the devices in question have been found unsuitable for diagnosing vitamin or mineral deficiencies and that claims made about similar products are implausible. 
","An experiment shows that the devices cannot distinguish between healthy people, seriously ill people and a corpse. The claimed mode of action behind the measurement method is also scientifically implausible. A German court has convicted the manufacturers of the Bioscan device (not legally binding) of fraud."
Will women who have recurrent bladder infections get rid of them faster if they take cranberry products only after the disease is already there???,"['There is also only evidence that cranberry products can prevent bladder inflammation for otherwise healthy women.', 'However, there does not seem to be any meaningful studies that have investigated this in women with recurrent bladder inflammation.', 'The preventive effect of cranberry in children, men and people with urinary catheters or certain diseases has not been studied.']",1,"There is limited research on the impact of cranberry products on treating existing bladder inflammation in women.  
","Women who repeatedly have to deal with bladder infections might become ill somewhat less frequently if they regularly take cranberry juice or extract. However, this is not well established.

",St. John's wort is likely to relieve the symptoms of mild to moderate depression better than a placebo. It also appears to be similarly effective to approved medications for depression (antidepressants). St. John's wort preparations are generally better tolerated than antidepressants.
"Does the Zisano bracelet strengthen the immune system, increase endurance and performance or reduce fatigue?","['Whether such bracelets have an effect, for example whether they can actually increase physical performance or strengthen the immune system, has apparently never been investigated.', 'Bracelets for more performance: studies show ineffectiveness All five studies came to the same conclusion: the bracelets had no effect on the performance or well-being of the subjects.', 'A scientifically plausible explanation as to how exactly such bracelets should develop their effect remains to be found in their suppliers.', 'The studies in detail We could not find any studies on the Zisano bracelet or comparable bracelets with silicon chip.']",1,"There is no scientific evidence to support the claims that Zisano bracelets can increase physical performance, strengthen the immune system, or reduce fatigue.  
","The promised positive effects of the ""Powerband"" wristband on health and well-being have apparently not been scientifically studied. We could not find any studies on this. It is also unclear how the wristband is supposed to work in concrete terms. A scientifically plausible explanation is missing."
"Does microimmunotherapy improve symptoms of allergies, cancer, joint inflammation, autoimmune diseases, dementia or various viral infections?","['None of these studies are meaningful – because they are poorly carried out and the published data are incomplete.', 'They cannot give any indication of the benefits of microimmune therapy.', 'Entitled doubts Since microimmune therapy preparations are highly diluted as homeopathic agents, we have fundamental doubts about the method.']",1,"The provided statements express skepticism about the effectiveness of microimmune therapy due to concerns about study quality and the nature of homeopathic dilutions.  
","So far, studies seem to exist only on microimmunotherapy against hay fever and cancer. Their significance is far too low to conclude that the therapy is effective. We found no studies on other health problems. Thus, there is no proven benefit of microimmunotherapy for any disease."
Can ginkgo extract improve mental performance in dementia patients?,"['Dementia patients taking Ginkgo extract often seemed to perform better in thinking, memory, and concentration tasks than those who swallowed placebo preparations without an active substance [1.3].', 'Although the studies indicate that Ginkgo extract can help people with dementia, the significance of the individual studies is limited.']",0,"While some studies suggest Ginkgo extract may lead to improved performance in thinking, memory, and concentration tasks for dementia patients, the overall significance of these studies is considered limited.

Does pine wood improve sleep?,"['So there is no indication that the pine wood improves sleep.', 'The importance of these laboratory measurements for the sleep of the participants is unclear – even if the researchers interpret them as positive effects of the circling bed.', 'Whether a pine bed actually improves sleep would have to study more rigorous studies carried out according to scientific criteria on significantly more subjects in the future.The studies in detail [1,2] Grote et al.']",1,"The provided studies do not offer conclusive evidence regarding the impact of pine wood on sleep quality.  
","So far, only one small study has investigated this question. However, the results of this study are not conclusive due to numerous deficiencies in the conduct of the study."
Do spermidine supplements or a spermidine-rich diet reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia? Do they help with existing dementia?,"['Spermidin studies: not enough as evidence of efficacy Even if both studies had come to overwhelmingly positive results, we would still have concerns about their significance.', 'Spermidine, which is additionally absorbed by food, is not sufficiently researched at the present time.', 'The number of participants is low and the risk is high that the results are not transferable to reality.', 'We do not consider the study to be meaningful.', 'Results: Both the spermidine group and the comparator group had fewer dementia symptoms and better mental performance at the end of the study.']",1,"While some studies suggest potential benefits of spermidine for dementia symptoms, the limited participant numbers and lack of conclusive evidence raise concerns about its generalizability and effectiveness.  
","Manufacturers of spermidine drugs advertise an alleged positive effect on mental performance and protection against dementia. However, such an effect has not been proven in meaningful studies. We found a single study in which dementia patients had participated. However, their results are not very clear."

Does the pill affect the muscle strength of women??,"['Does the pill also affect muscle strength?', 'The available studies do not provide any indication of such an effect.']",2,"The provided sentences state that current research does not indicate any impact of the pill on muscle strength.  
","Taking the pill could possibly impair endurance performance in sports somewhat. However, there are no indications of less muscle strength due to the pill. However, these - somewhat contradictory - findings are anything but certain. Whether the somewhat reduced endurance performance speaks against contraception with the pill, each athlete must decide for herself - depending on how important top athletic performance is for her."
Does transcranial pulse stimulation (TPS) improve mental performance in people with Alzheimer's dementia? Can the treatment improve the quality of life of those affected?,"['Therefore, we do not consider the study results to be meaningful.', ""Transcranial pulse stimulation: not recognized as Alzheimer's therapy Even if providers of transcranial pulse stimulation claim otherwise: as therapy, the treatment with ultrasound in dementia is neither researched nor recognized."", 'There are currently no studies that can prove that it can help people with dementia in the short term or in the long term.', 'None of the studies can answer whether transcranial pulse stimulation or similar procedures help people with dementia.']",1,"The provided sentences state that there is no scientific evidence to support the effectiveness of transcranial pulse stimulation for treating Alzheimer's dementia.

","In the pain treatment of wrist osteoarthritis, no efficacy can be assumed - this is indicated by the results of a small but well-done study. Research results on knee osteoarthritis are contradictory and therefore of little significance. We did not find any reliable studies on hip osteoarthritis."
Does blood type affect the likelihood that Covid 19 disease will take a severe course or lead to death?,"['Here, the results found seem to contradict the influence of the blood group on the probability of death: the researchers found no connection between certain blood groups and the severity of the disease.', 'Overall, the available data are not meaningful enough to establish or exclude a relationship between the blood group and the course of covid-19 disease.', 'It is certain that no one is protected from a serious Covid-19 history because of their type of blood.', 'No evidence of severe progression in certain blood groups The researchers found no evidence that in the case of a Covid-19 disease, people with a particular blood group need to be treated more frequently in hospital or intensive care units.']",1,"The provided research findings indicate no clear association between blood type and the severity or fatality of COVID-19.

Do sedatives and sleeping pills such as benzodiazepines and related substances increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease or other forms of dementia?,"['However, it cannot be clearly dispelled by the fact that benzodiazepines and similar substances could promote the development of dementia.']",1,"The provided sentence suggests a potential link between benzodiazepines and dementia development, but it does not definitively confirm this connection.  
","A link between the long-term use of sedatives and sleeping pills and the development of dementia cannot be ruled out. However, whether the drugs are the cause of dementia is unclear. Likewise, it is possible that studies show a connection only because people in the undiagnosed early stages of dementia suffer more frequently from sleep disorders or restlessness and therefore take medication against them more often."
"Does taking polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as omega-3 and omega-6, reduce ADHD symptoms in children?","['Overall, the preparations do not seem to make children with ADHD quieter and more concentrated.', 'Whether omega fatty acid preparations or placebo, all children showed similarly strong ADHD symptoms.', 'On closer examination, it appears that the best-performed, blinded studies show no or even a negative effect of the omega fatty acid preparations on the behaviour of the participating children.']",2,"The provided studies suggest that omega fatty acid preparations do not have a significant impact on ADHD symptoms in children.

","Current studies suggest that the intake of probiotics could counteract the development of atopic dermatitis. However, many questions about efficacy and intake remain unanswered."
Is Bulletproof Coffee recommended?,"['Conclusion Published studies with human subjects who have dealt with the subject of Bulletproof Coffee are not available.', 'It also lacks the basis to make statements about side effects and long-term safety of this food form.', 'Thus it should not be quite easy to make various effects dingfest.', 'Ingredients under the microscope We have not found any clinical studies on the effects of Bulletproof Coffee.', 'However, there are still various unexplained aspects around these references.']",1,"There is a lack of clinical studies on the effects of Bulletproof Coffee, making it difficult to assess its potential benefits or risks.  
","Bulletproof coffee is high in caffeine and fat. Is the hip breakfast substitute a kind of fitness potion? Or is it even harmful? Because there have been no studies on this coffee blend with human test subjects, we cannot make any reliable statements."
Do apples help with smoking cessation?,"['However, it is open which ingredients of apples should take the pleasure of tormenting – scientific evidence for this claim is missing.', 'However, apples do not appear in this context and in evidence-based recommendations [a], at least not as an aid.', 'However, the effects are small, and whether the apple taste is responsible can only be speculated.', 'On the other hand, it is not researched whether the apple really takes the appetite for the cigarette.']",1,"The provided sentences express uncertainty about the role of apples in smoking cessation, highlighting a lack of scientific evidence to support this claim.  
",Apples contain numerous ingredients and rightly have the reputation of being a healthy snack. Whether they can help to give up cigarettes has not yet been investigated in studies.
Do products made from fenugreek seeds help you lose weight?,"['However, the results do not indicate that an extract of plant seeds could help to reduce weight.', 'It is therefore unclear whether fenugreek seeds are able to lower blood sugar both in the short term and over longer periods of time.', 'Therefore, it remains unclear to what extent fenugreek seeds can be helpful in weight loss.', 'Whether the Fenulife product helps with weight loss can by no means be demonstrated by a study carried out for only three days.', 'The result is sobering: no meaningful studies of high quality were found.']",1,"The provided sentences highlight the lack of conclusive scientific evidence regarding the impact of fenugreek seeds on weight loss.  
","We found only one study in which participants had not lost weight after six weeks. However, the study period is very short, the number of participants small and the quality mediocre. It therefore remains unclear whether fenugreek seeds can help lose weight in the longer term."
Does skipping breakfast increase heart attack risk?,"['Obviously, therefore, the main reason for the increased risk of heart attacks was not to skip the morning meal, but overweight, diabetes, increased blood pressure, or too high cholesterol levels.', 'Thus, it is unclear whether the omission of breakfast leads to overweight or excess weight leads to the omission of breakfast.']",1,"The provided sentences discuss potential contributing factors to heart attacks, such as weight and cholesterol, without directly linking breakfast skipping to an increased risk.  
","There is no clear evidence that not eating breakfast could be a cause of obesity and, as a consequence, an increased risk of heart attack. It is possible, however, that it is primarily those people who are overweight and have a higher heart risk who forgo their morning meal."
Does wheat make you fat and sick?,"['But even if all of these mechanisms were correctly described, this does not necessarily mean that wheat makes you sick – the interplay of all mechanisms is not known.', 'Thus, the reduction of excess weight leads to health improvements, not the elimination of wheat.']",1,"While the sentences discuss mechanisms related to wheat consumption and health, they do not definitively conclude whether wheat causes sickness or weight gain.  
",There is no evidence in current studies that wheat has a special connection with obesity and its consequences. Attributing a special role to wheat seems implausible.
Do whole grains lower the likelihood of dying early?,"['Against cancer, heart problems and diabetes The current study situation shows something else: Those who frequently resort to whole grains get less cancer or cardiovascular diseases, for example a heart attack [1–4].', 'Thus, people in whom whole grains play a major role in their daily diet seem to live longer and healthier.', 'All four summaries come to the same conclusion: They show a clear correlation between a full-grain diet and a reduced chance of dying early.', 'At least as far as the reduced risk of disease is concerned, the data show a robust dose-effect relationship: the more whole grains are eaten, the lower the risk of disease [6].']",0,"The provided sentences suggest that a diet rich in whole grains is associated with a lower risk of diseases like cancer and heart problems, which may contribute to a longer lifespan. 
",People who eat whole grain products instead of foods made from refined flour are likely to live longer and probably have a lower risk of dying from cancer or cardiovascular disease.
"Does the consumption of dairy products promote mucus and diseases of the ear, nose and throat?","['No correlation between milk consumption and laboratory values The results of studies published so far in a systematic review do not indicate that high milk consumption increases inflammation levels in the blood.', ""However, the fact that the long-standing popular belief that cow's milk has a smearing effect is not likely to be confirmed by this, according to current knowledge.""]",1,"Current research does not demonstrate a link between milk consumption and increased inflammation levels, which could suggest a connection to mucus and related ailments.

Does regular consumption of energy drinks harm heart health?,"['Thus, energy drinks could potentially increase heart rate and blood pressure in the short term, but this is not the case in all studies.', 'However, the fact that the energy drinks had caused death is not certain.', 'There is no evidence that caffeine can cause cardiac arrhythmias or atrial fibrillation at moderate doses.', 'Larger doses of energy drinks can cause, for example, heart turf, tremor, arousal and digestive problems.']",1,"While some studies suggest potential short-term effects of energy drinks on heart rate and blood pressure, the evidence regarding long-term harm to heart health is inconclusive. 
",This question is insufficiently researched. Larger studies over a longer period of time are needed to assess the heart risk from energy drinks.
Do light drinks promote obesity?,"['However, the fact that sweeteners actually affect blood sugar and insulin levels has not been proven.', 'The largest work, a summary analysis of three studies involving a total of 125,000 participants [7], comes to the opposite conclusion – light drinks should therefore reduce the weight slightly.', 'No scientific evidence whether artificially sweetened lemonades promote the development of overweight is therefore not yet available.']",1,"While some research suggests a potential link between light drinks and weight reduction, conclusive evidence regarding their impact on obesity is currently lacking. 
","Several cohort studies show that people who frequently drink light drinks are more likely to be overweight. However, this does not prove that sweetener drinks make you fat. For it is equally conceivable that overweight people try to lose weight with light drinks. Whether they are successful in doing so is unclear."
Does coffee reduce the risk of dementia?,"['Scientists from Finland even want to find out that regular coffee drinking may also keep the brain fresh in the long term, in which it protects against dementia [1] [2].', 'And in fact, the scientists were able to establish a positive connection, but this effect seems to be above all a question of the coffee dose: the mental decline occurred most rarely during the course of the study in people who drank an average of one or two cups a day.', 'From the data from a total of eleven individual studies, the scientists concluded that people who consume a lot of caffeine had a reduced risk of dementia by about one-sixth (16%).', 'Further studies are necessary There are indications that people who drink a moderate amount of coffee daily are less at risk of developing cognitive disorders in the long term.']",0,"While some studies suggest a link between coffee consumption and a reduced risk of dementia, further research is needed to confirm this association.  
",One to two cups of coffee a day may protect against mental decline in the long term. It should not be more than that. It is unclear where this effect comes from and whether other caffeinated beverages might also be protective.
Does sugar consumption increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes regardless of obesity?,"['Soft drinks increase the risk of diabetes People with a preference for large amounts of sugar-containing sodas also suffer more frequently from diabetes.', 'In their analyses, two research teams [1,2] were able to independently show that the more sugar the study participants consume in the form of soft drinks, the higher the probability of developing type 2 diabetes.', 'It seems that daily consumption of sugared soft drinks can trigger diabetes over many years even if it does not make you fat.', 'Sugar content of other foods with unclear influence The association with type 2 diabetes is relatively clear for soft drinks.']",0,"The provided sentences focus on the link between sugary soft drinks and diabetes risk, without directly addressing sugar consumption from other food sources.  
","Sugar-containing soft drinks can - if consumed regularly - cause obesity. Obesity, in turn, increases the likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes. However, sugared soft drinks probably also increase the risk of diabetes independently of obesity."
Does a lower salt diet reduce the likelihood of cardiovascular disease?,"['Whether the many salt in the food was really the reason for cardiovascular diseases, however, cannot be unquestionably clarified.', 'The result: a low-salt diet seems to be able to actually reduce the likelihood of cardiovascular diseases.', 'Those who reduce their salt consumption can reduce blood pressure in the medium term.', 'Lowering the risk of consequential diseases caused by high blood pressure can help a diet that is poorer in salt.']",0,"While some evidence suggests a low-salt diet may help reduce blood pressure and related diseases, the direct link between salt intake and cardiovascular disease risk remains unclear. 
","A lower-salt diet has been shown to help reduce elevated blood pressure somewhat. It is possible, but not certain, that this reduces the likelihood of dying from a stroke or the consequences of narrowed heart vessels, such as a heart attack."
Does red wine protect better against cardiovascular disease than white wine?,"['However, they usually did not distinguish between white and red wine [1] [2] [3].', 'It can therefore not be proven that red wine protects particularly well against cardiovascular diseases.', 'Thus, people who consume small amounts of alcohol daily seem to have a lower cardiovascular risk and live a little longer than strict non-drinkers [1] [2] [3] [4].', 'The result: For a moderate dose of eight to ten grams of pure alcohol per day, the overall mortality and risk of cardiovascular disease were lower than for non- or minor drinkers.', 'The impact of the studies is limited Even if people who eat a glass of wine or beer daily live longer and healthier, this does not necessarily mean that alcoholic beverages are responsible.']",1,"While some studies suggest a correlation between moderate alcohol consumption and lower cardiovascular risk, they don't definitively prove that red wine offers superior protection compared to white wine.  
","There is evidence that moderate amounts of alcohol may protect against cardiovascular disease, but the effect is not well established. Whether this possibly protective effect is stronger with red wine than with white wine or other alcoholic beverages has not been sufficiently investigated."
Do azo food dyes cause attention deficit disorder and hyperactivity in children?,"['Since 2010, the EU has committed manufacturers to label food with azo dyes ""May affect the activity and attention of children"".', 'However, the summarized results of these and other previously published studies provide clear evidence that artificial food colours can cause attention and hyperactivity disorder (ADHS).', 'Although the bright-colored dyes could be a partial cause of ADHD, there are certainly many other unknown triggers [5].', 'The studies in detail The fact that azo dyes could be responsible for behavioural abnormalities of children suggests a clean summary of previous studies [2].', 'Compared to children who continued to consume azo dyes, behavioural abnormalities decreased slightly.']",0,"While some studies suggest a possible link between azo dyes and behavioral issues in children, the evidence is not conclusive and other factors may be involved.

Does turmeric prevent or cure cancer?,"['However, well-executed studies of this kind have so far been scarce.', 'After 6 months of administration, the values did not differ between turmeric and dummy subjects.', 'This makes it unclear whether any improvement observed is due to turmeric treatment or whether the health status of the study participants would have improved without turmeric.']",1,"The provided sentences highlight the lack of conclusive evidence regarding turmeric's impact on cancer, suggesting further research is needed.  
",Animal studies provide tentative evidence that turmeric can prevent or treat cancer. Whether turmeric has such an effect in humans cannot be assessed due to the low confidence level of a few studies conducted to date.
"Do boron preparations such as borax, boric acid, or calcium fructoborate relieve pain associated with age-related joint wear (osteoarthritis)?","['Even if their authors want to give a positive impression in their work – a critical look at the data shows that the Borax tablets could not alleviate arthrosis complaints among the participants.', 'There is no evidence that borax or boric acid can actually improve the discomfort in people with worn joints.', 'Those who suffer from chronic osteoarthritis pains and stiff joints and are hoping for relief through Borax should rely on more effective alternatives.']",1,"The provided sentences express skepticism about the effectiveness of boron preparations in alleviating osteoarthritis pain, citing a lack of evidence for their efficacy.  
","The few studies on this are of poor quality and therefore not trustworthy. Moreover, there is no evidence that the human body needs boron at all."
Can glutamate in food cause intolerance symptoms?,"['There are many case reports of an alleged glutamate hypersensitivity, but these can hardly be verified.', 'But among the alleged glutamate-sensitive subjects there was no one who showed symptoms after all glutamate [3].', 'The available studies show that up to three grams of glutamate does not cause symptoms in a selected group of healthy individuals.']",1,"While some individuals report symptoms after consuming glutamate, scientific studies have not found consistent evidence to support a link between dietary glutamate and intolerance.  
","There is no conclusive evidence that the consumption of glutamate triggers complaints. However, since studies conducted to date have shown deficiencies, it cannot be ruled out that there are isolated individuals who react sensitively to large amounts of glutamate."
Does the Orthopulse device accelerate the orthodontic correction of malocclusions?,"['Little meaningful The three published studies [1-3] cannot convince: None of the studies actually investigates the entire duration of treatment, but only the speed of tooth movements in the correction phase of brace therapy.', 'This does not make any sure statements about the reduction of the overall duration of treatment with which the manufacturer advertises.', 'Theoretically, two effects of orthopulses would be conceivable: positive effects if the duration of treatment were shortened, or negative effects if conversion processes at the tooth root were accelerated.', 'Thus, it is also questionable whether the faster treatment with the orthopulse device actually results from infrared therapy: In the control group, the teeth move on average by 0.44 mm per week, in the group with the orthopulse device on average by 1.27 mm per week.']",1,"While the sentences mention faster tooth movement with the Orthopulse device, they also highlight the lack of studies examining the full treatment duration and question whether the observed speed is solely due to infrared therapy.  
",Poorly done studies show that the device can accelerate tooth movement in the short term. Whether this reduces the overall treatment time has not yet been sufficiently proven. The methodological weaknesses of the studies also mean that the results are not very credible. Possible side effects have not yet been sufficiently investigated.
Are vegetables prepared in a microwave oven less healthy than those prepared in other ways?,"['Recent studies see the matter more differentiated: Depending on the variety of vegetables and the exact type of preparation, the microwave can sometimes be better and sometimes worse suited than, for example, cooking [2-12].', 'In the worst case, if it is exaggerated with the duration and the number of watts, the corresponding food is less health-promoting, but in no way harmful to health.', 'If there are health problems related to the microwave, then this is not because the microwave ingredients are destroyed or changed, but because it is simply too unhealthy to eat altogether.', 'The week-long feeding with always several times warmed up in the microwave has not led to any signs of poisoning in the animals.']",2,"The provided sentences suggest that microwave cooking can sometimes be as good or even better than other methods for preparing vegetables, but excessive use of high power can lead to less healthy outcomes. 
","How vegetables change during preparation is extremely variable. With any type of heating, ingredients can be lost or become more easily accessible. In sum, it cannot be said that preparation in the microwave is always a bad choice."
Can garlic extract reduce high blood pressure and thus the risk of cardiovascular disease?,"['Two better performed randomised-controlled studies provide cautious evidence that garlic can lower too high blood pressure [1].', 'However, even the results of these two studies are insufficiently valid for a clear assessment [1].', 'Whether garlic taken regularly can lower too high blood pressure and thus lower the risk of cardiovascular disease remains unclear for the time being.', 'At least in theory, there may also be interactions with anticoagulant drugs or side effects in persons with a tendency to bleed, as garlic is suspected to have an anticoagulant effect.']",1,"While some studies suggest garlic might lower blood pressure, the evidence is limited and further research is needed to determine its impact on cardiovascular disease risk. 
","Studies to date provide tentative evidence of a blood pressure-lowering effect of garlic. However, they are of too low quality to be able to prove a reduction in the risk of cardiovascular disease as a result of high blood pressure."
Can fructose damage the liver?,"['Fruit sugar as a cause not proven There are no meaningful indications for the assumption that fruit sugar is responsible for the development of the liver disease [1].', 'In other words, for the liver, it may not matter what kind of sugar you eat.']",1,"The provided sentences state that there is no scientific evidence to suggest fruit sugar is responsible for liver disease and that the type of sugar consumed may not significantly impact liver health.  
",There is no conclusive evidence for a possible liver-damaging effect of fructose.
Can green tea affect the likelihood of dying early and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease?,"['In fact, the summarized results of observational studies show that passionate green tea drinkers live longer on average – apparently because they are less likely to die from cardiovascular diseases such as heart attack [2,3].', ""However, a 100% proven cause-effect relationship à la ‘Green tea use protects against stroke, heart attack and co' cannot be derived from these observational studies."", 'We do not know exactly what the substances from the green tea in our body do – and what amounts can trigger a positive health effect.', 'Overall, the study data show that passionate green tea drinkers are less likely to die from cardiovascular diseases and thus live longer overall.', 'Seven RCTs are summarized here, and the authors concluded that green tea as a beverage or dietary supplement may have a beneficial influence on the risk factors of blood pressure, total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol.']",0,"While observational studies suggest a correlation between green tea consumption and a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and increased lifespan,  further research is needed to establish a definitive cause-and-effect relationship.

Can acupuncture prevent migraines and tension headaches?,"['Acupuncture works... From chronic migraines or tension headaches Affected patients get significantly rare headache attacks when they not only take conventional medication, but also undergo prophylactic acupuncture treatment.', '...but as good as migraine medications Another point suggests that acupuncture has a valuable prophylactic effect – at least for migraine sufferers: Further studies showed that acupuncture can only partially prevent migraine attacks, but at least as well as common medications [1].']",0,"The provided sentences suggest that acupuncture may have a partial preventative effect on migraines, comparable to conventional medications.  
","In the case of migraine, the preventive effect of acupuncture is probably similar to that of prophylactic medication. However, for both migraine and tension headaches, acupuncture performs only slightly better than sham acupuncture. Whether the pricking of traditional acupuncture points plays a role is unclear."
Can green tea reduce the likelihood of dying from cancer ?,"['In some studies, there was indeed a slightly reduced probability of disease, but other studies even suggested an increased risk of cancer from the use of green tea.', 'The result provides sobering clarity: people who regularly drink large amounts of green tea die in sum as often at some kind of cancer as people who hardly touch green tea [8].', 'To a degree harmless Although the benefits of green tea against cancer are questionable, there is no evidence of a health-impairing effect in moderate consumption of some cups a day [2].']",2,"While some studies suggest a potential link between green tea consumption and reduced cancer risk, other research indicates a possible increase in cancer risk, leaving the overall impact unclear. 
",The results of previous studies suggest that green tea cannot reduce the risk of dying from cancer.
Can plant sterols or foods with them reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease?,"['However, it is unclear whether the intake of such high amounts of plant sterols – e.g.', 'Whether these results are a coincidence or whether the higher rate of cardiovascular problems are actually due to plant sterols and not to other causes is unclear.', 'Cholesterol is also different Whether plant sterols can actually reduce not only LDL cholesterol levels, but also the risk of cardiovascular diseases, has not been investigated in a single clinical study.']",1,"While some studies suggest plant sterols may impact cholesterol levels, their direct effect on reducing cardiovascular disease risk remains unproven.  
","Plant sterols do lower cholesterol levels. However, whether they also reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease has not been researched.

Is combined hormone therapy with estrogen and progestin safe for women in late menopause (after the last menstrual period)?,"['Therefore, it is essential that women taking hormones in particular be informed about possible serious disadvantages, especially if they are taken over a longer period of time.', 'Apart from this, women have a higher risk of stroke in oestrogen hormone therapy, as well as women with combination drugs, and otherwise the side-effect profile is similar.', 'Whether women who start hormone treatment in this window of time are actually better protected from some diseases, however, is not well researched until today and not clear [2].', 'Among other things, the authors were interested in the advantages and disadvantages of hormone therapy for women after menopause.', 'Hormone therapy increases the risk of serious diseases.']",2,"The provided sentences highlight potential risks associated with hormone therapy, particularly for women in late menopause, and mention a lack of conclusive research on its long-term benefits.  
","Hormone therapy with estrogen- and progestin-containing preparations makes women more likely to suffer a stroke or heart attack. The risk of breast cancer is also increased. The hormone drugs probably protect a little against diabetes, colon cancer or bone fractures. However, they are no good as a preventive medicine because of the list of side effects. Women who want to relieve their menopausal symptoms with hormone preparations should carefully weigh up the possible benefits and risks with their doctor."
Can negative expectancy reduce the effect of pain medications?,"['Benefits and damage from nothing In randomized controlled studies, the nocebo effect can be observed well.']",2,"The provided sentences discuss the nocebo effect, which is a negative response to a treatment due to expectations, suggesting a potential link between negative expectancy and treatment outcomes.  
","Studies clearly show that ineffective placebo can bring severe side effects, depending on the patient's expectations. One effect can also be that the effectiveness of painkillers is limited."
