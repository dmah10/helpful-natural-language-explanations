Does paxlovid protect unvaccinated people with risk factors from severe or even fatal covid 19 disease?,"['Patients at risk without corona vaccination appear to be well protected from serious to fatal events by Paxlovid.', 'However, it is not certain how well Paxlovid helps people who have already received corona vaccination.', 'In addition, the scientists investigated whether Paxlovid alleviated the Covid-19 symptoms, shortened the duration of the disease and reduced the need for medical treatment: Half of the participants improved the symptoms with Paxlovid after 13 days, with placebo after 15 days.', 'With Paxlovid, 14 out of 1000 participants needed medical treatment for Covid-19 within a month, with placebo 76 out of 1000.', 'Whether with or without antibodies in the blood, Paxlovid basically protected all humans from a severe course.']",0,"While the sentences suggest that Paxlovid offers protection from severe or fatal Covid-19 for those with or without antibodies, they do not explicitly state whether this protection applies only to unvaccinated individuals with risk factors, leaving uncertainty regarding the claim.","In a large, well-done study, paxlovid prevented hospitalizations and deaths in high-risk patients. They were unvaccinated and had contracted the delta variant. For vaccinated people, the benefit cannot be reliably estimated. This also applies to people with immunodeficiency."
Does the consumption of soy foods or soy isoflavones affect the appearance of acne skin?,"['In both cases, certain soya ingredients are responsible for the effect on the skin: the isoflavones.', 'There are two competing theories that contradict each other: according to the first theory, isoflavones confuse the hormone balance and are supposed to promote acne in this way.', 'Surprisingly, despite searching in two large databases, we could not find a study on soy products and acne – whether soy milk, soy sauce or tofu.', 'The isoflavones improved the skin appearance more than an anti-acne cream with vitamin A acid (Tretinoin).', 'Conclusion: There is currently no evidence from reliable studies that soy makes acne worse.']",1,"While there are theories suggesting isoflavones in soy products can disrupt hormone balance and potentially promote acne, a thorough search of two large databases revealed no studies directly examining the relationship between soy and acne, making it difficult to definitively support or refute the claim.","We could not find any meaningful studies at all on the influence of soy foods on acne. On soy isoflavones, we found two small studies of questionable quality that examined a very specific group of sufferers. Soy isoflavones improved the skin appearance somewhat. However, this result is not reliable."
Is the homeopathic remedy Neradin effective for erectile dysfunction?,"['No studies on Neradin Also our search for studies on the product Neradin remained resultless.', 'Studies on the product Neradin also appear to be missing.']",1,"The claim cannot be supported because no studies on the effectiveness of Neradin for erectile dysfunction were found, and its impact remains unproven by available research.","The extract from the Damiana plant (Turnera diffusa) is advertised as a remedy for erectile dysfunction for men. However, this claimed effect on potency is by no means proven. It has apparently never been tested on humans. This also applies to homeopathic remedies such as the product Neradin."
Does regular HPV testing in addition to the recommended Pap smear detect more precancerous lesions than just the Pap smear alone?,"['According to the studies, the HPV test is likely to detect slightly more precursors of cervical cancer over several years than the PAP swab alone.', 'We are therefore relatively sure that with an additional HPV test at least a little more precursors of uterine cancer are detected than only with the PAP swab alone.']",0,"The studies indicate that HPV testing detects marginally more precancerous cervical lesions over time compared to Pap smears alone, providing evidence for the claim.","Regular examination of the cervix by means of PAP smear tests detects precancerous stages of the cervix in most cases in good time. This reduces the risk of developing cervical cancer. An additional HPV test every three to five years can make screening even more reliable. However, the difference should not be too great."
Can monk's pepper reduce PMS symptoms? PMS is the abbreviation for premenstrual syndrome. This refers to complaints that occur in the days before menstruation.,"['Reference to efficacy in PMS According to previous studies, monk peppers could actually help in PMS.', 'The summarized study results indicate that the symptoms with monk pepper are reduced in more patients than with a sham medication (placebo).', 'Therefore, it would be possible for monk peppers to act against PMS symptoms such as breast spacing.']",0,"The summarized results of previous studies suggest that monk pepper may reduce PMS symptoms more effectively than a placebo, providing support for the claim.","In the studies to date, monk's pepper seems to relieve PMS symptoms better than a placebo. However, this is not well proven, because the studies have significant weaknesses. There is no evidence of an effect on menstrual disorders. Significant studies are lacking."
Can olive leaf extract reduce high blood pressure?,"['These studies therefore do not indicate whether olive leaf extract can help with significantly increased blood pressure.', 'Without success, however, we could not find any studies that investigated the effect of olive leaf extract on cardiovascular health.', 'However, they cannot provide clear answers.', 'It is therefore impossible to say whether olive leaves extract could have a better or worse effect with significantly increased blood pressure.']",1,"The studies referenced do not provide clear evidence indicating whether olive leaf extract can help reduce high blood pressure, as no studies investigating its effect on cardiovascular health were found to be successful.","Whether olive leaf extract lowers blood pressure has been investigated in five suitable studies to date. They all found no effect or only a slight effect of the extract. The problem with this is that most of the study participants had only slightly elevated blood pressure. They cannot answer how olive leaf extract works in people with significantly elevated blood pressure (hypertension). The studies also had gross flaws, few participants, and ran for a very short time. They cannot provide reliable answers."
Do green-lipped mussel preparations improve the symptoms of osteoarthritis?,"['Studies overall not meaningful The conclusion of our research: Scientific evidence for the claimed effect is missing.', 'It is also unclear whether the measured positive effects are large enough to actually be felt by those affected.', 'Whether or not green-lipped mussel helps with osteoarthritis cannot be said at the moment.', 'However, as early as 2009, the European Food Safety Authority considered that a protective effect of the green-lipped mussel on healthy joints has not been established.', 'In our opinion, no reliable conclusions can be drawn from the studies found.']",1,"The claim that green-lipped mussel preparations improve the symptoms of osteoarthritis is not supported by the research, which finds no scientific evidence for the claimed effect and considers the measured positive effects too small to be perceptible by those affected.","The question was examined in four small studies with serious methodological deficiencies, which also arrived at partly contradictory results. No clear conclusions can be drawn from them. The claim that green-lipped mussel helps with osteoarthritis is not scientifically proven."
Can probiotics lower blood sugar in type 2 diabetes?,"['And if so, can probiotics reverse this change and reduce blood sugar levels again?', 'At the most small effect, they may actually be able to.', 'However, the effect of the capsules and tablets does not seem to be large: in the previous studies, they were able to reduce the long-term sugar level HbA1c by an average of 0.55 points.']",0,"While some studies suggest probiotics may have a small effect in reducing HbA1c levels by an average of 0.55 points in type 2 diabetes, the impact of capsules and tablets does not seem to be large.","The summarized results of studies to date suggest that probiotics in capsule or tablet form could lower blood sugar somewhat. At least if they are taken over a period of two to three months. However, the effect is not well established. Probiotic dairy products and probiotic powder for dissolving do not seem to have any demonstrable effect."
Can the so-called Tupler technique help against rectus diastasis?,"['No studies on the Tupler technique As intense as we were looking for, we could not find the promised studies on the Tupler technique.', 'The claim that this is a scientifically proven therapy for rectus diastase is therefore simply wrong.', 'The studies in detail We did not find any studies that investigated the effectiveness of the Tupler technique for the treatment of rectus diastase.']",1,"The claim that the Tupler technique is a scientifically proven therapy for rectus diastasis is incorrect, as no studies investigating its effectiveness for this condition were found.",We could not find a single study that examined whether the Tupler technique actually works. And this despite the fact that providers of the method advertise that its effectiveness is scientifically proven.
Can CBD (cannabidiol) help with migraines or other headaches?,"['Apparently, CBD has never been investigated to see if it can help with migraine seizures.', 'The claim that CBD would help with migraines or headaches is pure speculation.', 'The studies in detail Despite extensive search in three databases, we could not find any studies on CBD against migraine or other types of headache, neither for treatment nor for prevention.']",1,"While there are no studies found on CBD's effectiveness against migraines or other headaches, the claim of its helpfulness remains speculative.",There are no studies that have investigated the effectiveness of CBD against migraine. So claims that CBD can help with or prevent migraine attacks have no scientific basis. The same is true for other types of headache.
Can laser irradiation of blood by infusion needle (hemolaser treatment) relieve discomfort or help with diseases?,"['It is also unclear by what mechanism blood irradiation with bundled red light – i.e.', 'red laser – should improve health.', 'Although the authors of the three studies found [1-3] claim to have established a clear efficacy of haemolaser treatment, none of the three studies is suitable to prove this.']",1,"The three studies on hemolaser treatment lack the necessary rigor to establish its claimed efficacy in improving health, and the mechanism by which red laser irradiation of blood improves health remains unclear.",There is no scientific evidence that hemolaser treatment has a palliative or curative effect on health problems.
Can CBD help with period pain?,"['Because despite searching in three different databases we could not find a single study on CBD in case of regular pain.', 'Scientifically, it is not sufficiently researched whether CBD actually promotes sleep, as providers claim.', 'The studies in detail We could not find any studies that investigated whether CBD can help with normal pain – neither for treatment nor for prevention.']",1,"The sentences provide no evidence specifically regarding CBD's effect on period pain, as no studies were found to support this claim.",Whether CBD can relieve menstrual pain has apparently never been scientifically studied. We could not find any studies on this. Women who suffer from severe period pain should talk to a gynecologist about it. Diseases such as endometriosis could be behind it.
"Can a bioresonance device like ""Bioscan"" or ""Vieva Vital Analyser"" measure mineral and vitamin deficiencies or detect health problems?","['This experiment clearly shows that the devices studied are completely unsuitable to diagnose a lack of vitamins or minerals.', 'Sentenced for fraud at the end of May 2022, a German court also concluded that the Bioscan device cannot fulfil the claimed claims.', 'Claims for comparable products are equally implausible.', 'Even if 1000 subjects had participated in the study and only five to six people had shown such unreliable readings, such a device would be worthless for diagnostics.']",2,"The sentences provide evidence that Bioscan and similar devices cannot accurately measure mineral and vitamin deficiencies or detect health problems, as concluded by a German court and demonstrated in an experiment.","An experiment shows that the devices cannot distinguish between healthy people, seriously ill people and a corpse. The claimed mode of action behind the measurement method is also scientifically implausible. A German court has convicted the manufacturers of the Bioscan device (not legally binding) of fraud."
Does arthroscopy (joint endoscopy) help with osteoarthritis of the knee joint?,"['What might sound logical, however, has a catch: the arthroscopy of osteoarthritis does nothing to the treated person.', 'Studies clearly speak against a benefit A research team summarized the most meaningful of all previously published studies on arthroscopy in knee arthritis.', 'In these studies, patients treated after arthroscopy had no noticeably less pain or movement restrictions than those treated only for appearance or not at all.', 'Arthroscopy against osteoarthritis: not effective, but also not very risky After all: Undesirable events were not conspicuously common in the arthroscopy groups either.']",2,"The claim that arthroscopy helps with osteoarthritis of the knee joint is refuted by several studies indicating no significant reduction in pain or movement restrictions for patients who undergo the procedure, compared to those who receive no treatment or placebo treatment.",The data are clear: Arthroscopy is useless as a treatment for knee osteoarthritis. It can neither relieve pain nor improve the function of the knee joint in the long term.
"Do dietary supplements containing silicon (e.g. as ""organic silicon"" or silica) have health benefits?","['So far it is also completely unclear what role the element silicon plays in the human body at all [8].', 'We have researched: Previous studies do not provide any evidence that dietary supplements with silicon support bone build-up and thus protect older women from osteoporosis and bone fractures in old age [1,2].', 'There is no evidence that silicon improves the hair structure [3,4], strengthens the fingernails [4] or makes the skin more beautiful and elastic [4,6,7].', 'Also that silicon supports the formation of collagen and connective tissue is only a conjecture [8].', 'Conjectures without studies Neither we nor the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) [8] were able to find clinical studies on any other alleged health benefits of silicon.']",1,"The role of silicon in the human body is unclear, and no studies provide evidence that dietary supplements with silicon support bone build-up, improve hair structure, strengthen fingernails, make the skin more beautiful, or support collagen and connective tissue formation.","There is no evidence so far that the additional intake of silicon can promote health. Also that it strengthens nails, skin and hair is an unsubstantiated claim. Moreover, it is unclear whether silicon plays any role at all in the body."
Can regular intake of cranberry juice or cranberry extract prevent recurrent cystitis in women?,"['The summarized results show that the regular intake of cranberry products could have a preventive effect.', 'There is also only evidence that cranberry products can prevent bladder inflammation for otherwise healthy women.', 'Overall, there is evidence of a possible preventive effect of cranberry.']",0,"The summarized results indicate that cranberry products may prevent bladder inflammation for generally healthy women, but the evidence does not clearly support a preventive effect against recurrent cystitis in all women.","Women who repeatedly have to deal with bladder infections might become ill somewhat less frequently if they regularly take cranberry juice or extract. However, this is not well established. And it only applies to uncomplicated bladder infections in otherwise healthy women. Whether cranberry products help when cystitis is already present remains unclear. This has not yet been investigated in meaningful studies."
Will women who have recurrent bladder infections get rid of them faster if they take cranberry products only after the disease is already there???,"['There is also only evidence that cranberry products can prevent bladder inflammation for otherwise healthy women.', 'However, there does not seem to be any meaningful studies that have investigated this in women with recurrent bladder inflammation.', 'The preventive effect of cranberry in children, men and people with urinary catheters or certain diseases has not been studied.']",1,"The claim cannot be supported or refuted because there is no meaningful study that has investigated the effect of cranberry products on women with recurrent bladder infections, as stated in the sentences.","Women who repeatedly have to deal with bladder infections might become ill somewhat less frequently if they regularly take cranberry juice or extract.

Can extract from St. John's wort relieve the symptoms of depression? Is it similarly effective as drugs against depression (antidepressants)?,"[""St John's wort: effective in mild to moderate depression Probably yes."", ""In mild to moderate depression, St John's wort preparations probably work better than placebo."", ""St John's wort preparations are probably as good as antidepressants."", ""St. John's wort and antidepressants can relieve the discomfort, but the depression can probably not cure for good.""]",0,"The claim is supported by the sentences stating that St. John's wort is likely effective in mild to moderate depression, works better than a placebo, and is as good as antidepressants, although it may not cure depression permanently.",St. John's wort is likely to relieve the symptoms of mild to moderate depression better than a placebo. It also appears to be similarly effective to approved medications for depression (antidepressants). St. John's wort preparations are generally better tolerated than antidepressants.
"Does the Zisano bracelet strengthen the immune system, increase endurance and performance or reduce fatigue?","['Whether such bracelets have an effect, for example whether they can actually increase physical performance or strengthen the immune system, has apparently never been investigated.', 'Bracelets for more performance: studies show ineffectiveness All five studies came to the same conclusion: the bracelets had no effect on the performance or well-being of the subjects.', 'A scientifically plausible explanation as to how exactly such bracelets should develop their effect remains to be found in their suppliers.', 'The studies in detail We could not find any studies on the Zisano bracelet or comparable bracelets with silicon chip.']",1,"The claim that the Zisano bracelet strengthens the immune system, increases endurance and performance, or reduces fatigue is not supported by the provided sentences, as there is no scientific evidence found regarding the effectiveness of the Zisano bracelet or similar bracelets with a silicon chip.","The promised positive effects of the ""Powerband"" wristband on health and well-being have apparently not been scientifically studied. We could not find any studies on this. It is also unclear how the wristband is supposed to work in concrete terms. A scientifically plausible explanation is missing."
"Does microimmunotherapy improve symptoms of allergies, cancer, joint inflammation, autoimmune diseases, dementia or various viral infections?","['None of these studies are meaningful – because they are poorly carried out and the published data are incomplete.', 'They cannot give any indication of the benefits of microimmune therapy.', 'Entitled doubts Since microimmune therapy preparations are highly diluted as homeopathic agents, we have fundamental doubts about the method.']",1,"The claim cannot be supported as the provided sentences express doubts about the method of microimmunotherapy due to its high dilution, similar to homeopathic agents, and question the validity of studies due to incomplete data and poor execution.","So far, studies seem to exist only on microimmunotherapy against hay fever and cancer. Their significance is far too low to conclude that the therapy is effective. We found no studies on other health problems. Thus, there is no proven benefit of microimmunotherapy for any disease."
Can ginkgo extract improve mental performance in dementia patients?,"['Dementia patients taking Ginkgo extract often seemed to perform better in thinking, memory, and concentration tasks than those who swallowed placebo preparations without an active substance [1.3].', 'Although the studies indicate that Ginkgo extract can help people with dementia, the significance of the individual studies is limited.']",0,"While some studies suggest Ginkgo extract may help dementia patients with thinking, memory, and concentration tasks, the significance of individual studies is limited.",Previous studies suggest that ginkgo extract can improve mental performance in dementia - but this is not well established. It is not possible to say exactly how large this effect is.
Does pine wood improve sleep?,"['So there is no indication that the pine wood improves sleep.', 'The importance of these laboratory measurements for the sleep of the participants is unclear – even if the researchers interpret them as positive effects of the circling bed.', 'Whether a pine bed actually improves sleep would have to study more rigorous studies carried out according to scientific criteria on significantly more subjects in the future.The studies in detail [1,2] Grote et al.']",1,"While some studies suggest positive effects of pine wood on sleep quality, the first sentence directly refutes the claim that pine wood improves sleep, stating there is no indication of such an effect.","So far, only one small study has investigated this question. However, the results of this study are not conclusive due to numerous deficiencies in the conduct of the study."
Do green-lipped mussel preparations improve the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis?,"['For us, therefore, this claim is not credible.', 'Whether green-lipped mussel helps with rheumatism or not, can therefore not be said for sure at the moment.', 'Whether the results can be transferred to other products or other dosages is unclear.', ""The studies are all badly done according to today's standard: so it is unclear how reliable the measurements of the treatment success are."", 'Whether rheumatism patients would still benefit from green-lipped mussel preparations remains unclear.']",1,"While some studies exist, their quality is questionable, making it unclear if green-lipped mussel preparations alleviate rheumatoid arthritis symptoms or if results can be applied to different products or dosages.","Five small studies provide no overall evidence of benefit from green-lipped mussel in rheumatism. However, the rheumatism treatment of the participants does not meet today's standards and the studies were very poorly conducted. Therefore, we cannot draw any reliable conclusions from these studies."
Does covid vaccination reduce the likelihood of getting long-lasting symptoms (long covid) in case of corona infection?,"['Long-Covid risk with low vaccination Two studies [1,2] suggest that the long-covid risk is likely to be lower if vaccinated twice: In one of these studies with Corona infected [1], twice vaccinated patients reported 40 to 50 percent less likely to be affected by Long Covid compared to non-vaccinated patients.', 'Results Two-fold Vaccinated people reported to be affected by long-covid symptoms only about half as often as non-vaccinated people.']",0,"Twice vaccinated individuals report being affected by long-covid symptoms roughly half as often as non-vaccinated individuals, suggesting a lower risk of long-lasting symptoms with vaccination.","If twice-vaccinated people are infected, their risk of later being affected by Long Covid may be only half that of non-vaccinated people.

Can the preventive intake of lysine prevent cold sores (lip herpes) and genital herpes? Can lysine help when the blisters are already there?,"['You cannot answer whether preventively taken lysine can prevent herpes, or whether it helps if the blisters are already there.', ""So the lysine didn't seem to have any effect."", 'Does a higher dose of lysine work better than a lower dose?', 'Results Overall, the participants had no less frequent herpes, whether they were taking high-dose lysine, low-dose lysine or placebo.', 'Results The results are ambiguous and do not allow for certain conclusions: both the Lysin group and the placebo group were less likely to have lip herpes after 6 months.']",1,"The sentences provided offer no definitive evidence that preventively taken lysine can prevent herpes or help when blisters are already present, as some results are ambiguous and no significant difference was found between lysine doses or placebo.",Research is coming up with inconclusive and contradictory results. All available studies are small and of unclear quality. We could not say whether lysine protects against herpes or can alleviate it.
"Do hormonal contraceptives to swallow (the ""pill"") affect endurance performance in women?","['The conclusion of the work: Women taking the pill could actually have a minor disadvantage in sports.', 'Specifically, women with a pill may absorb less oxygen during training and are out of breath faster.', 'Possibly a slightly lower performance through the pill – to this conclusion also came another current overview work [2].']",0,Women taking hormonal contraceptives may experience a minor decrease in endurance performance due to reduced oxygen absorption during training and increased breathlessness.,"Taking the pill could possibly impair endurance performance in sports somewhat. However, there are no indications of less muscle strength due to the pill. However, these - somewhat contradictory - findings are anything but certain. Whether the somewhat reduced endurance performance speaks against contraception with the pill, each athlete must decide for herself - depending on how important top athletic performance is for her."
Does whole-body cryotherapy in the cold chamber improve health?,"['Moreover, they cannot ensure that alleged improvements are really due to the cold chamber.', 'Based on these data, it is impossible to assess whether whole-body cooling therapy is effective and useful in different health problems.', 'However, none of the studies can prove the effectiveness of the cold chamber treatment, because everyone lacks meaningfulness.']",1,"The studies on whole-body cryotherapy do not provide sufficient evidence to determine its effectiveness in improving health, as they cannot ensure improvements are due to the cold chamber and lack meaningfulness.","Studies published so far are of low quality and therefore not conclusive.

This has not yet been scientifically investigated. We also could not find a single study on vitamin C and fatigue occurring in the context of Long Covid.
Does high-dose vitamin D slow down the course of disease in multiple sclerosis (MS)?,"['However, such observations alone are not sufficient to actually demonstrate the benefit of highly dosed vitamin D in MS.

Is quarantining persons who have had contact with infected persons or who enter from high-risk areas an effective measure to reduce the number of COVID-19 infections and deaths?,"['In their review, the researchers concluded that quarantine should be an effective measure.', 'There is also evidence that the quarantine of returning travellers from risk areas can help to reduce the spread.', 'They support the assumption that the precautionary withdrawal of potentially infected people from public life is an important contribution to contain the pandemic.', 'Quarantine alone is too little The research team stresses, however, that even if an early and strict quarantine seems to be effective – as a sole measure to curb the current COVID-19 pandemic, it is probably not sufficient.', 'Despite the methodological weaknesses, the studies mainly point in one direction: the isolation of potentially infected persons without symptoms seems to reduce the number of cases of infection and deaths – especially at an early start and in combination with other measures such as school closures and social/physical distancing.']",0,"The claim is supported by the sentences, as multiple studies suggest that quarantining contacts of infected persons and travelers from high-risk areas can help reduce the spread of COVID-19, especially when implemented early and in combination with other measures.","The analysis of 29 studies suggests that quarantine can prevent COVID-19 infections and deaths. The validity of the studies to date is diminished by the fact that only mathemathic modeling studies are available for coronavirus. However, observational studies and modeling of the related diseases SARS and MERS show much the same thing: precautionary quarantine of those who may be infected is likely to be effective, especially if the action is taken early. As a stand-alone measure, quarantine is unlikely to be sufficient to sustainably contain the pandemic."
Can homeopathic globules protect against infection with the novel coronavirus?,"['After studies on homeopathy against coronaviruses one is looking in vain.', 'Whether globuli can do anything against the new Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has never been scientifically verified.', 'Our conclusion: Based on the available scientific studies, we can currently assume that homeopathic remedies themselves have no effect.']",1,"The sentences provide no evidence of homeopathic globules protecting against the novel coronavirus, as no scientific studies have verified this claim.","There is no evidence that globules can protect against the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).

On the other hand, there are individual cases of bone cancer in people treated with teriparatide - although a causal relationship cannot be clearly proven here. Systematic studies of people treated with teriparatide could not provide clear results. Since bone cancer is a very rare disease, its risk factors are difficult to pin down in studies."
Can therapy with EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) alleviate the symptoms of people with post-traumatic stress disorder?,"['Probably effective Our research revealed that people with post-traumatic stress disorder are probably better off after a psychotherapy with EMDR than people who have not received any psychotherapeutic treatment at all.', 'Our conclusion With EMDR therapy, post-traumatic stress disorder is likely to improve more than completely without therapy.', 'That they are effective has been shown in well conducted studies [1].Studies in detail Since the 1990s, the topic of trauma therapy has been intensively researched using EMDR.', 'The result: with EMDR therapy, the subjects had less complaints than without any treatment.']",0,"The claim is supported by the sentences, as they indicate that EMDR therapy has been shown to improve symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder compared to no treatment.",Therapy with EMDR is probably more effective than no therapy at all for people suffering from the psychological consequences of a traumatic experience.

"Does daily flossing protect against tooth decay, periodontitis and tooth loss?","['Study situation not sufficient for dental floss recommendation Although prayer mill-like repeated, the effectiveness of dental floss for dental health has in fact hardly been studied more closely so far.', 'It is therefore not clear whether floss actually results in rare caries, gum inflammation or periodontitis or if the teeth are preserved longer.', 'Whether the additional effort is worthwhile for people with healthy teeth and intact gums remains as open as the question of to what extent floss can help with severe inflammation of the gums.', 'In fact, there is evidence that the correct cleaning technique with floss could be decisive for the success and avoidance of side effects: The lateral tooth surfaces should therefore be freed from tooth coverings by careful up-and-down movements [1] [2] [5].', 'The studies so far do not really help: because they have observed too few people over too short periods of time and are partly of poor quality, they do not provide sufficient basis for the general recommendation to use floss every day and from childhood onwards.']",1,"While some studies suggest dental flossing may be beneficial if used correctly, overall evidence is insufficient to conclusively support its role in preventing tooth decay, periodontitis, or tooth loss.","It is possible that regular flossing of the interdental spaces can help with mild gingivitis. However, there are no good studies that investigate whether this has a preventive effect against inflammation in healthy gums. The effect on the development of plaque is unclear. There are no studies at all on the question of whether flossing leads to fewer cavities, periodontitis or tooth loss."
Does music therapy promote recovery from severe limitations of consciousness after severe brain injury?,"['Effects of music therapy too little investigated In a detailed literature research, we have only been able to promote few relevant investigations to the surface.', 'None of the studies found involved music as a single treatment for severe brain damage and unconsciousness.', 'Most studies have had very few patients, have serious methodological deficiencies and do not answer the question whether the patients actually achieve significant and long-term improvements in consciousness through treatment.', 'This makes it unclear whether the results are transferable to people who have been in a wake-up coma or minimal state of consciousness for a long time.', 'In addition, it is unclear whether the results of the study can also be transferred to other forms of treatment such as playing familiar pieces of music.']",1,"The claim that music therapy promotes recovery from severe limitations of consciousness after severe brain injury is unsupported, as there is a lack of extensive research and methodologically sound studies demonstrating significant and long-term improvements in consciousness through music therapy, particularly when used as a single treatment for severe brain damage and unconsciousness.","We have not found any high-quality studies that specifically investigate the effect of music therapy. Some scientists explored the influence of stimulation of the senses, in which acoustic stimuli are also used. However, since these studies followed only a few people over short periods of time and had many methodological problems, they do not allow us to draw any firm conclusions."
Can eating grapefruit in combination with some medications lead to harmful interactions?,"['A whole range of different medicines should be able to have serious health consequences in combination with grapefruits – either as fruit or as juice.', '85 medicines have been found, the effect of which may be influenced by the consumption of grapefruits.', 'A list of medicines for which severe side effects have been observed or suspected in combination with grapefruit can be found at the end of this article.', 'In some cases, the consumption of a single fruit or a glass of grapefruit juice appears to be sufficient, in other cases harmful overdoses were observed only after days or weeks of regular consumption.', 'The thrombosis-promoting effect of ethinylestradiol, a main active substance of conventional contraceptive pills, is increased by grapefruits.']",0,"The claim is supported by the sentences, as multiple sources confirm that grapefruit can interact with a variety of medications, leading to serious health consequences, and this includes ethinylestradiol, a main active substance of contraceptive pills.","Yes, grapefruits can enhance the effects of some medications.

However, many questions about efficacy and intake remain unanswered."
Is Bulletproof Coffee recommended?,"['Conclusion Published studies with human subjects who have dealt with the subject of Bulletproof Coffee are not available.', 'It also lacks the basis to make statements about side effects and long-term safety of this food form.', 'Thus it should not be quite easy to make various effects dingfest.', 'Ingredients under the microscope We have not found any clinical studies on the effects of Bulletproof Coffee.', 'However, there are still various unexplained aspects around these references.']",1,"The claim that Bulletproof Coffee is recommended cannot be supported since there are no published human studies evaluating its effects or long-term safety, and no clinical studies on its ingredients' effects have been found.","Bulletproof coffee is high in caffeine and fat.

Because there have been no studies on this coffee blend with human test subjects, we cannot make any reliable statements."
Do apples help with smoking cessation?,"['However, it is open which ingredients of apples should take the pleasure of tormenting – scientific evidence for this claim is missing.', 'However, apples do not appear in this context and in evidence-based recommendations [a], at least not as an aid.', 'However, the effects are small, and whether the apple taste is responsible can only be speculated.', 'On the other hand, it is not researched whether the apple really takes the appetite for the cigarette.']",1,"The sentences provide no substantial evidence supporting the claim that apples help with smoking cessation, as they mention a lack of scientific support, absence in evidence-based recommendations, and unclear connection between apple taste and reduced cigarette cravings.",Apples contain numerous ingredients and rightly have the reputation of being a healthy snack. Whether they can help to give up cigarettes has not yet been investigated in studies.
Do products made from fenugreek seeds help you lose weight?,"['However, the results do not indicate that an extract of plant seeds could help to reduce weight.', 'It is therefore unclear whether fenugreek seeds are able to lower blood sugar both in the short term and over longer periods of time.', 'Therefore, it remains unclear to what extent fenugreek seeds can be helpful in weight loss.', 'Whether the Fenulife product helps with weight loss can by no means be demonstrated by a study carried out for only three days.', 'The result is sobering: no meaningful studies of high quality were found.']",1,"The sentences provide no evidence supporting the claim that fenugreek seeds help with weight loss, as they indicate a lack of high-quality studies and unclear effects on blood sugar and weight reduction.","We found only one study in which participants had not lost weight after six weeks. However, the study period is very short, the number of participants small and the quality mediocre. It therefore remains unclear whether fenugreek seeds can help lose weight in the longer term."
Does skipping breakfast increase heart attack risk?,"['Obviously, therefore, the main reason for the increased risk of heart attacks was not to skip the morning meal, but overweight, diabetes, increased blood pressure, or too high cholesterol levels.', 'Thus, it is unclear whether the omission of breakfast leads to overweight or excess weight leads to the omission of breakfast.']",1,"The claim that skipping breakfast increases heart attack risk is not directly supported by the sentences, as they suggest that other factors like overweight, diabetes, increased blood pressure, or high cholesterol levels are the main reasons for the increased risk.","There is no clear evidence that not eating breakfast could be a cause of obesity and, as a consequence, an increased risk of heart attack. It is possible, however, that it is primarily those people who are overweight and have a higher heart risk who forgo their morning meal."
Does wheat make you fat and sick?,"['But even if all of these mechanisms were correctly described, this does not necessarily mean that wheat makes you sick – the interplay of all mechanisms is not known.', 'Thus, the reduction of excess weight leads to health improvements, not the elimination of wheat.']",1,"While the claim suggests a connection between wheat and health issues, the sentences provided do not support this claim directly, instead emphasizing the role of excess weight in health improvements and the lack of understanding about the interplay of all mechanisms.",There is no evidence in current studies that wheat has a special connection with obesity and its consequences. Attributing a special role to wheat seems implausible.
Do whole grains lower the likelihood of dying early?,"['Against cancer, heart problems and diabetes The current study situation shows something else: Those who frequently resort to whole grains get less cancer or cardiovascular diseases, for example a heart attack [1–4].', 'Thus, people in whom whole grains play a major role in their daily diet seem to live longer and healthier.', 'All four summaries come to the same conclusion: They show a clear correlation between a full-grain diet and a reduced chance of dying early.', 'At least as far as the reduced risk of disease is concerned, the data show a robust dose-effect relationship: the more whole grains are eaten, the lower the risk of disease [6].']",0,"The sentences provide evidence that a diet rich in whole grains is associated with a reduced risk of disease and a potential increase in lifespan, but they do not directly address the likelihood of dying early.",People who eat whole grain products instead of foods made from refined flour are likely to live longer and probably have a lower risk of dying from cancer or cardiovascular disease.
"Does the consumption of dairy products promote mucus and diseases of the ear, nose and throat?","['No correlation between milk consumption and laboratory values The results of studies published so far in a systematic review do not indicate that high milk consumption increases inflammation levels in the blood.', ""However, the fact that the long-standing popular belief that cow's milk has a smearing effect is not likely to be confirmed by this, according to current knowledge.""]",1,"The claim that dairy consumption promotes mucus and diseases of the ear, nose, and throat is not supported by the findings of a systematic review indicating no correlation between milk consumption and increased inflammation levels in the blood, nor is it confirmed by the lack of evidence for cow's milk having a smearing effect.",There is no scientific evidence to prove that cow's milk causes mucus.
Do light drinks promote obesity?,"['However, the fact that sweeteners actually affect blood sugar and insulin levels has not been proven.', 'The largest work, a summary analysis of three studies involving a total of 125,000 participants [7], comes to the opposite conclusion – light drinks should therefore reduce the weight slightly.', 'No scientific evidence whether artificially sweetened lemonades promote the development of overweight is therefore not yet available.']",1,"While a summary analysis of three studies involving 125,000 participants suggests that light drinks might slightly reduce weight, there is no concrete scientific evidence proving that artificially sweetened lemonades promote overweight development.","Several cohort studies show that people who frequently drink light drinks are more likely to be overweight. However, this does not prove that sweetener drinks make you fat. For it is equally conceivable that overweight people try to lose weight with light drinks. Whether they are successful in doing so is unclear."
Does coffee reduce the risk of dementia?,"['Scientists from Finland even want to find out that regular coffee drinking may also keep the brain fresh in the long term, in which it protects against dementia [1] [2].', 'And in fact, the scientists were able to establish a positive connection, but this effect seems to be above all a question of the coffee dose: the mental decline occurred most rarely during the course of the study in people who drank an average of one or two cups a day.', 'From the data from a total of eleven individual studies, the scientists concluded that people who consume a lot of caffeine had a reduced risk of dementia by about one-sixth (16%).', 'Further studies are necessary There are indications that people who drink a moderate amount of coffee daily are less at risk of developing cognitive disorders in the long term.']",0,"The claim is partially supported by studies indicating that moderate coffee consumption may reduce the risk of dementia, particularly in people who drink an average of one or two cups a day, and those who consume a lot of caffeine had a reduced risk by about 16%. However, further research is needed to establish a definitive connection.",One to two cups of coffee a day may protect against mental decline in the long term. It should not be more than that. It is unclear where this effect comes from and whether other caffeinated beverages might also be protective.
Does sugar consumption increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes regardless of obesity?,"['Soft drinks increase the risk of diabetes People with a preference for large amounts of sugar-containing sodas also suffer more frequently from diabetes.', 'In their analyses, two research teams [1,2] were able to independently show that the more sugar the study participants consume in the form of soft drinks, the higher the probability of developing type 2 diabetes.', 'It seems that daily consumption of sugared soft drinks can trigger diabetes over many years even if it does not make you fat.', 'Sugar content of other foods with unclear influence The association with type 2 diabetes is relatively clear for soft drinks.']",0,"The sentences provide evidence that soft drink sugar consumption increases type 2 diabetes risk, regardless of obesity, as higher soft drink sugar intake is associated with a higher probability of diabetes.","Sugar-containing soft drinks can - if consumed regularly - cause obesity. Obesity, in turn, increases the likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes. However, sugared soft drinks probably also increase the risk of diabetes independently of obesity."
Does a lower salt diet reduce the likelihood of cardiovascular disease?,"['Whether the many salt in the food was really the reason for cardiovascular diseases, however, cannot be unquestionably clarified.', 'The result: a low-salt diet seems to be able to actually reduce the likelihood of cardiovascular diseases.', 'Those who reduce their salt consumption can reduce blood pressure in the medium term.', 'Lowering the risk of consequential diseases caused by high blood pressure can help a diet that is poorer in salt.']",0,"While the relationship between salt and cardiovascular diseases is not definitively established, a low-salt diet has been found to reduce blood pressure and the risk of subsequent diseases caused by high blood pressure.","A lower-salt diet has been shown to help reduce elevated blood pressure somewhat. It is possible, but not certain, that this reduces the likelihood of dying from a stroke or the consequences of narrowed heart vessels, such as a heart attack."
Is less eaten from red plates?,"['The result: The test subjects who were served their pretzels on red plates accessed significantly less than participants with blue or white plates.', 'In a second experiment, subjects also drank soft drinks in a larger amount of blue instead of red cups.', 'As logical as this explanation may sound, the study does not yet provide scientific evidence that red plates really eat less.', 'In both salty and sweet snacks, the participants gained less when they were lying on a red plate in front of them.']",0,"The study's findings indicate that test subjects consumed fewer salty and sweet snacks from red plates compared to blue or white plates, but the evidence does not conclusively prove that red plates cause a reduction in food consumption.","In two psychological experiments, participants were less likely to eat salty pretzels, popcorn or chocolate chips if they were served on red plates. It is unclear whether the effect lasts over a longer period of time."
Does red wine protect better against cardiovascular disease than white wine?,"['However, they usually did not distinguish between white and red wine [1] [2] [3].', 'It can therefore not be proven that red wine protects particularly well against cardiovascular diseases.', 'Thus, people who consume small amounts of alcohol daily seem to have a lower cardiovascular risk and live a little longer than strict non-drinkers [1] [2] [3] [4].', 'The result: For a moderate dose of eight to ten grams of pure alcohol per day, the overall mortality and risk of cardiovascular disease were lower than for non- or minor drinkers.', 'The impact of the studies is limited Even if people who eat a glass of wine or beer daily live longer and healthier, this does not necessarily mean that alcoholic beverages are responsible.']",1,"The claim that red wine protects better against cardiovascular disease than white wine cannot be proven by the provided sentences, as most studies do not distinguish between the two types of wine and moderate alcohol consumption, regardless of type, seems to lower cardiovascular risk.","There is evidence that moderate amounts of alcohol may protect against cardiovascular disease, but the effect is not well established. Whether this possibly protective effect is stronger with red wine than with white wine or other alcoholic beverages has not been sufficiently investigated."
Do azo food dyes cause attention deficit disorder and hyperactivity in children?,"['Since 2010, the EU has committed manufacturers to label food with azo dyes ""May affect the activity and attention of children"".', 'However, the summarized results of these and other previously published studies provide clear evidence that artificial food colours can cause attention and hyperactivity disorder (ADHS).', 'Although the bright-colored dyes could be a partial cause of ADHD, there are certainly many other unknown triggers [5].', 'The studies in detail The fact that azo dyes could be responsible for behavioural abnormalities of children suggests a clean summary of previous studies [2].', 'Compared to children who continued to consume azo dyes, behavioural abnormalities decreased slightly.']",0,"The EU's requirement for azo dye labeling indicating potential effects on children's activity and attention, along with studies suggesting a link between azo dyes and ADHD, implies a possible connection; however, the evidence is not definitive and other factors may contribute to ADHD.",Some studies fuel the suspicion that azo dyes can exacerbate ADHD symptoms.
Does turmeric prevent or cure cancer?,"['However, well-executed studies of this kind have so far been scarce.', 'After 6 months of administration, the values did not differ between turmeric and dummy subjects.', 'This makes it unclear whether any improvement observed is due to turmeric treatment or whether the health status of the study participants would have improved without turmeric.']",1,"The claim that turmeric prevents or cures cancer is not supported by the provided sentences, as there is a lack of clear evidence showing an improvement in health status due to turmeric treatment compared to no treatment.",Animal studies provide tentative evidence that turmeric can prevent or treat cancer. Whether turmeric has such an effect in humans cannot be assessed due to the low confidence level of a few studies conducted to date.
Does breastfeeding reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome?,"['The scientists conclude that the risk of breastfed children is halved compared to un breastfed children [2].', 'However, the matter has a small catch: the studies analysed show a connection.', 'The studies in detail The fact that breastfeeding reduces the risk of unexpected death of a baby is only moderately secure.', 'However, this does not necessarily prove that breastfeeding is the reason for the lower risk of infant death.']",0,"While studies suggest a connection between breastfeeding and a lower risk of sudden infant death syndrome, they do not definitively prove that breastfeeding is the cause of this reduced risk.","Breastfeeding can possibly reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome, but this is not entirely certain.

Moreover, there is no evidence that the human body needs boron at all."
Does the Orthopulse device accelerate the orthodontic correction of malocclusions?,"['Little meaningful The three published studies [1-3] cannot convince: None of the studies actually investigates the entire duration of treatment, but only the speed of tooth movements in the correction phase of brace therapy.', 'This does not make any sure statements about the reduction of the overall duration of treatment with which the manufacturer advertises.', 'Theoretically, two effects of orthopulses would be conceivable: positive effects if the duration of treatment were shortened, or negative effects if conversion processes at the tooth root were accelerated.', 'Thus, it is also questionable whether the faster treatment with the orthopulse device actually results from infrared therapy: In the control group, the teeth move on average by 0.44 mm per week, in the group with the orthopulse device on average by 1.27 mm per week.']",1,"The studies on the Orthopulse device only investigate the speed of tooth movements during brace therapy, not the entire duration of treatment, providing insufficient evidence to confirm the manufacturer's claim of reduced overall treatment time.",Poorly done studies show that the device can accelerate tooth movement in the short term. Whether this reduces the overall treatment time has not yet been sufficiently proven. The methodological weaknesses of the studies also mean that the results are not very credible. Possible side effects have not yet been sufficiently investigated.
Is it harmful for the mental development of the unborn child if the mother regularly eats fish contaminated with mercury during pregnancy?,"['For previous studies suggest that the consumption of larger amounts of mercury-containing fish could slightly affect the mental performance of the offspring [1, 2, 3].', 'The studies in detail The fact that methyl mercury can damage the brain of unborn children already in concentrations in which the pregnant mothers themselves do not notice any symptoms is beyond question [6].', 'In investigations into the Faroe Islands and New Zealand, the assumption was confirmed: expectant mothers with high mercury levels were given children, whose mental performance was on average slightly worse in later tests than that of unloaded mothers – the mercury levels of the mothers were mostly so high, because they had consumed large amounts of contaminated fish before and during pregnancy.', 'Impact on the IQ Despite these contradictions, the consumption of contaminated fish seems to reduce the intelligence of the offspring measurable, although it is not yet clear how much.', ""A research team at Harvard University calculated an average reduction in the intelligence ratio of 0.7 points for each micrograms of mercury in mother's hair [2] in the analysis of studies from the Faroe Islands, Seychelles and New Zealand.""]",0,"The claim is supported by studies suggesting a slight decrease in mental performance of the offspring when the mother consumes large amounts of mercury-contaminated fish during pregnancy, with measurable reductions in IQ observed.","Many commercially available types of edible fish are contaminated with traces of methyl mercury. There are indications that regular consumption of such mercury-containing fish during pregnancy can impair the brain development of unborn children and thus their later mental abilities. In contrast, consumption of fish low in mercury could promote brain development in the unborn."
Can the consumption of caffeine during pregnancy harm the unborn child?,"['However, the study showed that it made no difference whether the participants drank around three cups of caffeine or decaffeinated coffee.', ""On average, the weight of birth at birth was about the same, was similar in size and was not more frequently born too early even after the mother's caffeine consumption."", 'Similar to the summary of the Cochrane overview work: In early pregnancy three cups of coffee daily would have no effect on birth weight, growth or premature birth [2].']",1,"The study's findings indicate that caffeine consumption during pregnancy, equivalent to around three cups of coffee, does not negatively impact birth weight, size, or gestational age at birth.",There is insufficient evidence that moderate consumption of caffeinated beverages would have a negative impact on the child's development. Up to three cups of coffee a day does not appear to reduce the child's birth weight. Very large amounts of caffeine-containing beverages could possibly contribute to lower birth weight.
Are vegetables prepared in a microwave oven less healthy than those prepared in other ways?,"['Recent studies see the matter more differentiated: Depending on the variety of vegetables and the exact type of preparation, the microwave can sometimes be better and sometimes worse suited than, for example, cooking [2-12].', 'In the worst case, if it is exaggerated with the duration and the number of watts, the corresponding food is less health-promoting, but in no way harmful to health.', 'If there are health problems related to the microwave, then this is not because the microwave ingredients are destroyed or changed, but because it is simply too unhealthy to eat altogether.', 'The week-long feeding with always several times warmed up in the microwave has not led to any signs of poisoning in the animals.']",2,"While some studies suggest that microwave preparation of vegetables can be better or worse than other methods depending on the type and duration, there is no evidence indicating that microwaved vegetables become harmful to health or that health issues related to microwaves stem from ingredient destruction.","How vegetables change during preparation is extremely variable. With any type of heating, ingredients can be lost or become more easily accessible. In sum, it cannot be said that preparation in the microwave is always a bad choice."
Can fructose damage the liver?,"['Fruit sugar as a cause not proven There are no meaningful indications for the assumption that fruit sugar is responsible for the development of the liver disease [1].', 'In other words, for the liver, it may not matter what kind of sugar you eat.']",1,"The claim that fructose can damage the liver is not supported by the provided sentences, which indicate that there is no substantial evidence linking fruit sugar to liver disease development, and the type of sugar consumed may not significantly affect the liver.",There is no conclusive evidence for a possible liver-damaging effect of fructose.
Can green tea affect the likelihood of dying early and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease?,"['In fact, the summarized results of observational studies show that passionate green tea drinkers live longer on average – apparently because they are less likely to die from cardiovascular diseases such as heart attack [2,3].', ""However, a 100% proven cause-effect relationship à la ‘Green tea use protects against stroke, heart attack and co' cannot be derived from these observational studies."", 'We do not know exactly what the substances from the green tea in our body do – and what amounts can trigger a positive health effect.', 'Overall, the study data show that passionate green tea drinkers are less likely to die from cardiovascular diseases and thus live longer overall.', 'Seven RCTs are summarized here, and the authors concluded that green tea as a beverage or dietary supplement may have a beneficial influence on the risk factors of blood pressure, total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol.']",0,"The claim is partially supported by observational studies indicating a correlation between green tea consumption and reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, which may contribute to longer lifespans, but the exact cause-effect relationship and active substances are not fully understood.","There is a lack of conclusive studies on the health effects of specific matcha. However, there is some evidence that green tea in general may reduce the likelihood of dying prematurely, especially from cardiovascular disease."
Can acupuncture prevent migraines and tension headaches?,"['Acupuncture works... From chronic migraines or tension headaches Affected patients get significantly rare headache attacks when they not only take conventional medication, but also undergo prophylactic acupuncture treatment.', '...but as good as migraine medications Another point suggests that acupuncture has a valuable prophylactic effect – at least for migraine sufferers: Further studies showed that acupuncture can only partially prevent migraine attacks, but at least as well as common medications [1].']",0,"While some studies suggest acupuncture can reduce the frequency of migraine attacks at least as well as conventional medications, it only has a partial preventive effect.","In the case of migraine, the preventive effect of acupuncture is probably similar to that of prophylactic medication. However, for both migraine and tension headaches, acupuncture performs only slightly better than sham acupuncture. Whether the pricking of traditional acupuncture points plays a role is unclear."
Can green tea reduce the likelihood of dying from cancer ?,"['In some studies, there was indeed a slightly reduced probability of disease, but other studies even suggested an increased risk of cancer from the use of green tea.', 'The result provides sobering clarity: people who regularly drink large amounts of green tea die in sum as often at some kind of cancer as people who hardly touch green tea [8].', 'To a degree harmless Although the benefits of green tea against cancer are questionable, there is no evidence of a health-impairing effect in moderate consumption of some cups a day [2].']",2,"While some studies suggest a slight reduction in disease probability with green tea consumption, others indicate an increased cancer risk, and overall, regular drinkers of large amounts of green tea die from cancer at similar rates as those who rarely drink it, providing no clear evidence of reduced likelihood of dying from cancer due to green tea consumption.",The results of previous studies suggest that green tea cannot reduce the risk of dying from cancer.
Can plant sterols or foods with them reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease?,"['However, it is unclear whether the intake of such high amounts of plant sterols – e.g.', 'Whether these results are a coincidence or whether the higher rate of cardiovascular problems are actually due to plant sterols and not to other causes is unclear.', 'Cholesterol is also different Whether plant sterols can actually reduce not only LDL cholesterol levels, but also the risk of cardiovascular diseases, has not been investigated in a single clinical study.']",1,"While studies show that plant sterols can lower LDL cholesterol levels, there is no clinical study demonstrating that they reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases specifically.","Plant sterols do lower cholesterol levels. However, whether they also reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease has not been researched.

Can too much iodine cause autoimmune thyroid disease and consequently hypothyroidism?,"['Individual studies suggest that too large amounts of iodine may be responsible.', 'Probably a variety of causes These study results suggest that Hashimoto disease is more likely to occur in people with particularly high iodine consumption.', 'However, large amounts of iodine may cause serious disturbances in people with potentially undetected thyroid problems [8].', 'The studies in detail Whether large amounts of iodine can actually cause inflammation of the thyroid gland by an overreacting immune system is not well protected.', 'The result: the higher the iodine intake in a region, the greater the proportion of residents who suffer from autoimmune thyroid inflammation.']",0,"The claim is partially supported by individual studies suggesting a link between high iodine consumption and Hashimoto's disease, but the evidence is not conclusive on iodine directly causing inflammation of the thyroid gland or hypothyroidism.",Autoimmune thyroid disease appears to occur more frequently in individuals with high iodine consumption. Whether high levels of iodine actually cause this disease has not been conclusively determined.
Does coffee affect cancer death risk?,"['Both studies concluded that coffee consumption has no effect on cancer mortality.', 'In other words, coffee generally does not seem to favor or prevent death through cancer.', 'For breast cancer, prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer and bladder cancer there seems to be no association with the consumption of coffee.', 'Conclusion: Coffee consumption does not seem to affect cancer mortality.', 'They did not detect any influence of coffee on the number of cancer deaths.']",2,"The studies consistently show no association between coffee consumption and a reduced or increased risk of cancer mortality, including specific types such as breast, prostate, pancreatic, and bladder cancer.",Current evidence suggests that coffee consumption in general is neither protective nor detrimental to cancer death risk.

Well-done studies should help clarify the situation in the future so that more targeted treatment is possible."
Is there a health risk from metal contaminants in lipsticks?,"['Risk in individual cases unclear The cited study by the team led by study leader Liu [1] analysed 32 products on their metal content.', 'The small amounts of lipstick thus do not lead to an increased risk of poisoning.', 'If the use of lipsticks is therefore a health risk when used very frequently, only more detailed and extensive studies can show.']",1,"While the study analyzed 32 lipstick products for metal content, it does not provide clear evidence of a health risk from metal contaminants in lipsticks, especially given the small amounts and unclear risk in individual cases.","Several chemical analyses find traces of metals in lipsticks, which can in principle be harmful in high concentrations. However, the analyses do not examine the quantities in which the metals are actually absorbed and whether they cause damage in the body. Overall, there is still too little research into whether there could be a risk for some of the metal impurities if they are used very frequently."
Can topiramate reduce the frequency of migraine attacks?,"['The authors summarized the results of 17 studies and found that the number of headaches actually decreases – but only by one in 28 days.', '[1] The overview also shows positive effects on the overall quality of life, but only to a small extent and not quite without contradiction.', 'Although all studies go in the same direction and indicate the effectiveness of topiramate, despite the review work of Cochrane Collaboration, the evidence is low, also because there are other criticisms: The authors have several conflicts of interest and it is possible that studies with poor results have not been published (publication bias).', 'Little knowledge about chronic migraine In the expert recommendation on therapy and care for chronic migraine, two small studies are mentioned, according to which topiramate can also prevent in chronic migraine attacks [2].']",0,"The claim is partially supported by the first sentence indicating a decrease in headaches, but the overall evidence is low due to conflicts of interest, potential publication bias, and small study size, as mentioned in the third sentence.","Possibly yes. A review by the Cochrane Collaboration attests that topiramate slightly reduces the frequency of migraine attacks in adults, and in some patients the attacks even decrease significantly.

Additionally, vitamin B6, B12, and folic acid preparations do not prevent the progression of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.",Three randomized-controlled trials show that such a dietary supplement (Souvenaid®) is unlikely to markedly slow or halt the progression of Alzheimer's dementia. Taking omega-3 fatty acid or vitamin B supplements alone also does not appear to have such an effect.
Does meditation help against stress?,"['Stress reduction in healthy people is shown, but not whether it is actually due to treatment.', 'A new review [3] summarizes 47 studies and brings better data – even if things remain complicated: Although some forms of meditation work against stress, only in comparison to control groups that receive no other targeted treatment.', 'The authors of an overview of mindfulness-based stress reduction [4] report in their summary that this form of therapy improves mental health, both in healthy people and in some patients with mental illnesses.', 'According to the systematic review work of 2014, not all types of meditation are equally effective: for mindfulness-based meditation, an effectiveness can be demonstrated, but not for transcendental meditation, in which the concentration of attention is sought to dissolve [3].']",0,"While some forms of meditation have been shown to reduce stress compared to control groups with no other targeted treatment, the effectiveness of all types of meditation in stress reduction is not uniform, as mindfulness-based meditation demonstrates effectiveness but transcendental meditation does not.","Various forms of meditation seem to be able to alleviate stress both in healthy individuals and in people with mental illness.

Do rising temperatures and CO2 levels increase the risk of pollen allergy?,"['It is unclear whether the increase in CO2 has already caused a noticeable increase in the amount of pollen released.', 'Influence on allergy risk unclear However, whether the increasing pollen exposure also increases the risk of developing pollen allergy for non-allergic agents is unclear.', 'Whether higher levels of pollen increase the probability of hay fever is so far unclear [5].', 'There is nothing to read about pollen becoming more aggressive in so far published studies.']",1,"While there is evidence suggesting that increased pollen exposure may not necessarily increase the risk of developing pollen allergy for non-allergic individuals, the relationship between rising temperatures, CO2 levels, and pollen aggressiveness remains unclear due to a lack of relevant studies.","Rising temperatures and increased CO2 concentrations cause plants to produce larger amounts of pollen over a longer period of time. However, it is unclear whether larger amounts of pollen and a longer pollen season increase the likelihood of developing pollen allergy."
Does glucosamine prolong life?,"['This is exactly what happens once again in the article on glucosamine as a life prolonger: The study was conducted on nematodes (fade worms) and mice and in which glucosamine led to an extended life span [1].', 'The conclusion of the researchers: If glucosamine has the same effect in two different species and these processes are also conceivable in humans, then glucosamine is highly likely to prolong life expectancy in humans.', 'Yes, with many limitations There is a cohort study on humans on this question: In 2010, a first evaluation looked at the influence of 20 vitamins or dietary supplements on life expectancy [3]; of these 20 only glucosamine and chondroitin showed a possible relationship with life expectancy.', 'The researchers speculate that glucosamine prolongs life expectancy just as was found in aspirin [2].', 'Until then, the life-prolonging effect of glucosamine remains optimistic speculation with little evidence.']",0,"While some studies suggest a possible relationship between glucosamine and life expectancy in nematodes and mice, human cohort studies provide limited evidence, and the life-prolonging effect remains speculative.","Although research here is still in its infancy and there is only one cohort study in humans besides basic studies, this shows possible effects.

Are animal-assisted therapies effective for mental illness?,"['The authors conclude from the data that animal assisted therapies may be effective in some diseases, including mental disorders and behavioural disorders such as depression, schizophrenia and addiction.', 'There is still no reliable data on the efficacy of animal-based therapy, for example in patients with cancer and advanced fatal diseases, in terms of state of health and quality of life.']",0,"The first sentence provides evidence that animal-assisted therapies may be effective for mental and behavioral disorders, but the second sentence indicates a lack of reliable data for their efficacy in patients with cancer and advanced fatal diseases, leaving the claim's applicability to all mental illnesses unsupported by the given sentences.","Studies on the effects of animal-assisted therapies are only partially conclusive. It seems plausible that animal-assisted therapies can be supportive for some mental illnesses; however, very large or rapid effects are unlikely."
Can lack of sleep cause obesity?,"['So, most likely, lack of sleep is just one of many different factors that can affect weight gain.', 'Cause unclear The mere fact that people with a lack of sleep are more likely to be overweight or gain more weight than those who sleep, however, does not necessarily mean that the lack of sleep is the real cause of obesity.', 'People who sleep too little usually have an unhealthy lifestyle in general, so other factors can also play a role in increasing weight gain.', ""Whether lack of sleep actually makes you fat can't be said from previous study results – even if there is evidence that people who sleep little may become overweight rather than people with normal sleep.""]",1,"While research suggests a correlation between lack of sleep and increased likelihood of obesity, it does not definitively establish lack of sleep as the cause, as other factors associated with poor sleep habits could also contribute to weight gain.",People who regularly get too little sleep may be more likely to be overweight than those who get enough sleep. But whether lack of sleep itself causes obesity is unclear.
Is breaking an energy-saving lamp harmful to health?,"['[3] If an energy-saving lamp breaks, the mercury contained therein escapes, among other things, in the form of mercury vapour.', 'However, these experiments did not directly investigate whether this could lead to signs of poisoning in humans.', 'Even if the safety limit has been exceeded in some cases, mercury vapour concentrations in the ambient air did not reach levels for which a health hazard is considered probable in any study.']",1,"While mercury vapor is released when an energy-saving lamp breaks, studies have not established a probable health hazard from increased mercury vapor concentrations in ambient air, even when safety limits were exceeded.","If an energy-saving lamp breaks, mercury vapor is released in quantities that can exceed the limits considered safe. Whether this can cause damage to health has not been directly investigated. However, after removal of the broken glass and good ventilation of the room, the value quickly falls back below the limit value."
Does copper intake increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease?,"[""Because there are no studies that associate an increased uptake of copper directly with an increased Alzheimer's risk [6].""]",1,The claim that copper intake increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease is not supported by a study directly associating increased copper uptake with an increased Alzheimer's risk.,Some studies claim to have found links between high copper levels and Alzheimer's disease.

Does unprocessed red meat increase the risk of cardiovascular disease?,"['They found no connection between the consumption of unprocessed red meat and heart disease.', 'However, the study results contradict each other, so we do not know whether meat can actually cause cardiovascular disease [4].', 'Whether the cause of the increased probability of disease was actually the consumption of red meat cannot be determined from the study data.']",1,"While some studies suggest no connection between unprocessed red meat and heart disease, other results are contradictory, leaving uncertainty about red meat's role in cardiovascular disease.","Whether unprocessed red meat increases the likelihood of cardiovascular disease is unclear, and study results are conflicting. However, processed red meat such as ham, bacon or sausages could increase the risk."
Does psychotherapy help with burnout?,"['Most of the studies on burnout symptoms deal with cognitive behavioral therapy.', 'According to a systematic review [1] Cognitive behavioral therapy seems to be able to alleviate the consequences of permanent stress in the longer term.', 'Physiotherapy showed no better success than standard treatment in a study after six or twelve months.', 'However, more studies would be needed to make a clear assessment.']",0,"The claim is partially supported by a systematic review indicating that cognitive behavioral therapy can alleviate the consequences of permanent stress in the long term, although more studies are needed to make a clear assessment.","Of the psychotherapy modalities, only Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) has evidence of potential efficacy for burnout. For other forms of psychotherapy, the scientific evidence is unclear or non-existent."
Is electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) in combination with ordinary fitness training more efficient than fitness training alone?,"['However, according to a meta-analysis summarising the results of 17 studies, the effect is no greater than in conventional strengthening exercises [ 1 ].', 'Full-body EMS as a fitness method hardly investigated While the electrical stimulation of individual muscle groups for therapeutic purposes was investigated by some research groups, there are hardly any scientific studies on the whole-body EMS as a fitness training replacement.']",1,"The claim is not supported by the first sentence, which states that a meta-analysis of 17 studies found no greater effect from EMS in combination with fitness training compared to conventional strengthening exercises alone.","There is evidence for the principle effectiveness of EMS for muscle strengthening. For a superiority of the combination of EMS and ordinary training compared to fitness training alone, the evidence is contradictory."
Can vitamin and nutrient supplements prevent the eye disease age-related macular degeneration?,"['Progress probably slows down In fact, the summarized results of previously published studies show that a combination of vitamin C, E, beta-carotene and zinc can probably maintain the increasingly deteriorating vision longer.', 'However, the fact that a vitamin mix seems to slow the progression of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is largely due to the results of a single study conducted by the US ""AREDS"" research team [1] [3].', 'This study examined a mixture of 500 mg vitamin C, 400 IU vitamin E, 15 mg beta-carotene, 80 mg zinc oxide and 2 mg copper oxide.', 'It is well established that vitamin E and beta-carotene are not suitable for prevention – they cannot prevent the ocular disease from developing in old age.']",2,"The claim is partially supported by a single study conducted by the US ""AREDS"" research team, which suggests that a specific combination of vitamins and minerals can slow the progression of age-related macular degeneration, but there is no evidence that these supplements can prevent the disease from developing.","Vitamin E and beta-carotene cannot prevent the development of age-related macular degeneration. However, in combination with zinc and vitamin C, they probably allow certain forms of an existing disease to progress somewhat more slowly."
Do milk or dairy products promote colon cancer and rectal cancer?,"['For ovarian cancer, breast cancer and cancer of the uterine mucosa, the authors of extensive systematic reviews have so far found no evidence of a reduction in risk or an increase in risk [3] [4] [5].', 'However, the study situation is still too unclear to draw definitive conclusions, which requires more and more meaningful studies.', 'There is also the possibility that dairy products will reduce the likelihood of bladder cancer.']",2,"The claim that milk or dairy products promote colon cancer and rectal cancer is not supported by the provided sentences, which only discuss the relationship between dairy and other types of cancer.","It is likely that dairy products reduce the risk of colon and rectal cancer, and possibly bladder cancer. However, very large amounts of milk & dairy products could possibly increase the risk of prostate cancer. It should be remembered that about the same number of men die from colon and rectal cancer as from prostate cancer. For breast and ovarian cancer and cancer of the endometrium, it is unclear whether cancer risk is affected by milk and dairy products."
Which of the three most common laser eye surgeries produces the best results and has the fewest side effects?,"['However, the study situation is still rather thin, new and large studies could still change somewhat in this assessment.', 'At present, all three methods lead to very good results, which, according to the first long-term studies [3], are likely to be sustainable.', 'Results from a few years ago are no longer meaningful today because the treatment method has changed.', 'Long-term studies therefore always refer to the state of the art at that time, but already suggest that laser treatments are safe and sustainable [1] [2] [3].']",0,"While current long-term studies indicate that all three laser eye surgeries lead to safe and sustainable results, the study situation is still evolving, and recent treatment method changes make it difficult to rely on older results.","If only new studies are considered, all three techniques are equally successful. Probable advantages of LASIK: less pain after surgery and good vision more quickly."
Does the drug fingolimod reduce the progression of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis similarly or better than previous drugs?,"['The recently newly approved active substance Fingolimod in Europe causes white blood cells (T cells) to be held back in the lymph nodes, which prevents them from causing inflammation by immigrating to the brain.', 'By means of systematic literature research, we wanted to find out whether fingolimod is similar to or better than previous multiple sclerosis – drugs can inhibit the progression of the disease.']",0,"The first sentence provides a mechanism for how fingolimod may affect multiple sclerosis, but it does not directly compare fingolimod's effectiveness to previous drugs, making it difficult to determine if the claim is supported or refuted based solely on this information.","Two manufacturer-funded clinical trials attest Fingolimod such efficacy that exceeds that of interferon beta therapy. However, the drug can also cause serious side effects."
Can cancer be successfully fought with intentionally induced fever?,"['==References== In the 19th century, the idea was born that fevers protect against cancer.', 'No major modern studies have been conducted in which deliberately triggered fever has been tested as therapy.']",1,"While the concept of fever as a cancer protector originated in the 19th century, no recent major studies have tested fever induction as therapy, leaving insufficient evidence to support or refute the claim.","In the early 20th century, cancer was indeed sometimes fought with fever, sometimes successfully. But the therapies and trials are poorly documented and were risky. An assessment of efficacy is not possible based on the studies to date."
Does electro-acupuncture on the ear help against pain?,"['Thus, the repeated electrical irritation of acupuncture points on the ear seems to be able to stop some chronic neck or cross pain [ 2, 3 ].', 'The pain could not be brought to total disappearance, but the study participants needed less painkillers than without electro-acupuncture over the duration of a few weeks.', 'Acupuncture on the ear probably effective against pain Overall, different acupuncture methods on the ear may effectively reduce pain.']",0,"The sentences provide evidence that electro-acupuncture on the ear can reduce the need for painkillers in people with chronic neck or cross pain, but they do not indicate that it can completely eliminate pain.","Electro-ear acupuncture could be supportive against chronic pain such as neck or low back pain. The method cannot completely replace painkillers. For surgery-related pain, the effectiveness is uncertain."
Does treatment with the new drug erenumab reduce the number of migraine days per month?,"['In other words, compared to a sham medication, individuals with episodic migraines were spared on average 1 to 2 migraine days per month by erenumab [1-4].', 'So far no serious side effects The side effects of erenumab – as far as the earlier rather shorter studies at least – do not seem to be serious: those who used erenumab complained a little more frequently than those with the dummy medication about injection site reactions, constipation, muscle cramps and itching [6].', 'Because erenumab has so far only been compared with placebo.', 'No long-term data The results on efficacy and safety first sound as if people with a similar condition as in the studies could actually benefit from erenumab.']",0,"The claim is partially supported by the first sentence, which indicates that individuals with episodic migraines experienced fewer migraine days per month with erenumab compared to a sham medication; however, the claim cannot be fully evaluated due to the lack of comparisons with other treatments beyond a placebo and the absence of long-term data, as mentioned in the third and fourth sentences.","In five studies available to date, which tend to be shorter, participants suffered from migraine less frequently with erenumab than with a placebo. The studies were of high methodological quality. In episodic migraine, people ""saved"" about 1 to 2 migraine days per month . For chronic migraine, sufferers had about 2.5 fewer days of pain per month. However, the efficacy and safety data relate to a maximum time frame of six months; the long-term benefit still needs to be explored. The benefit of erenumab compared to other established preventive migraine drugs has also not yet been researched."
Do saw palmetto preparations help with benign prostate enlargement?,"['[4] [7] A well substantiated statement can only be made for saw palm preparations: A data analysis published in 2012 shows that these remedies do not work better than placebos and are therefore ineffective.', 'However, it might be useful to continue to follow certain indications of symptom-improving plants and to compare them with new studies – at least in older studies, extracts of the African plum tree, willow grass pollen and the plant ingredient beta-sitosterin were considered safe and possibly effective.', '[updated and supplemented on March 1, 2015 with details on saw palm extracts, beta sitosterol, extracts of the African plum tree and willow grass pollen extract] ( Author: J. Harlfinger, Review: B. Kerschner, C. Christof ) Recommend article:']",2,"The data analysis published in 2012 indicates that saw palmetto preparations do not have a more significant effect than placebos, which contradicts the claim of their effectiveness for benign prostate enlargement.","Many men with benign prostate enlargement turn to herbal remedies. However, current evidence for reliable and long-term efficacy is generally lacking, and most remedies are not well studied. It is therefore not possible to lump all products together. Preparations containing the plant ingredient beta-sitosterol, extracts of the African plum tree or ryegrass pollen extract could possibly lead to some improvement - however, this cautious assumption is based on outdated data. However, the current finding is this: remedies containing saw palmetto do not work any better than placebo and are thus considered ineffective."
Does not wearing bras provide medical benefits?,"['Our conclusion Scientific evidence on health advantages or disadvantages of bras is missing.', 'Also the studies, on the basis of which it is recommended to wear a well-seated bra in a painful breasts, are not meaningful: In a work already over 40 years old 114 women with a painful breast got to wear a well-suited bra, for which they could choose from 144 different sizes [2].', 'Thus, it remains unclear whether, for example, there would have been an improvement even without bra treatment.', 'In the bra group, all women initially complained of a lack of comfort, but later 85 percent of patients reported an improvement in chest discomfort.']",1,"The claim that not wearing bras provides medical benefits is not supported by the provided sentences, as a study showing that wearing a well-fitted bra may alleviate breast discomfort does not exclude the possibility of improvement without bra treatment, and there is a lack of scientific evidence on health advantages or disadvantages of bras.","Whether it is healthier or even beneficial not to wear a bra cannot be answered due to a lack of studies.
