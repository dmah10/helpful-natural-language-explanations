Can masks reduce corona infections when worn by a large proportion of the population?,"['Studies show slow spread After three years of pandemic, there are now relatively meaningful data that masks can slow down the spread of the Corona virus.', 'Surgical masks, in turn, seem to reduce the risk of infecting themselves with the corona virus.']",0,"The first sentence supports the claim by indicating that studies show masks can slow down the spread of the Corona virus, while the second sentence provides additional evidence that surgical masks specifically can reduce the risk of self-infection.","International studies suggest that the number of corona infections decreases when many people wear masks - whether fabric, surgical or FFP2 masks. However, it is not possible to precisely quantify how great the protective effect actually is. It probably depends on the type of masks and the proportion of people who wear them."
Can homeopathic preparations with Anamirta cocculus help against dizziness?,"['But without success: We could not find any meaningful scientific evidence for effectiveness in dizziness.', 'It is now well proven by studies that homeopathic preparations usually do not work better than a sham medication (placebo) [8].', 'However, it is not well established that betahistine is effective against dizziness [11.13].', 'The fact that betahist helps with dizziness is not well documented [11, 13].']",1,"While there is no strong scientific evidence supporting the use of homeopathic preparations with Anamirta cocculus for dizziness, the effectiveness of betahistine, a conventional treatment, is also not well documented according to the provided sentences.","We have found only one study that has investigated this. However, it is so poor that no reliable statement is possible."
Can zeolite alleviate or prevent health problems?,"['However, none of these can provide any evidence – because the studies have no significance (for reasons see section Studies in detail ).', 'It does not find an advantage for zeolite – but the results are hardly meaningful.', 'However, it is not researched whether the regular intake of zeolite can lead to a nutrient deficiency or has an undesirable effect on digestion.']",1,"The claim that zeolite can alleviate or prevent health problems is not supported by the provided sentences, which indicate a lack of significant studies and unclear effects on nutrition and digestion.",Studies to date cannot provide any evidence that taking zeolite prevents or alleviates complaints. A detoxifying effect is not scientifically plausible.
Does paxlovid protect unvaccinated people with risk factors from severe or even fatal covid 19 disease?,"['Patients at risk without corona vaccination appear to be well protected from serious to fatal events by Paxlovid.', 'However, it is not certain how well Paxlovid helps people who have already received corona vaccination.', 'In addition, the scientists investigated whether Paxlovid alleviated the Covid-19 symptoms, shortened the duration of the disease and reduced the need for medical treatment: Half of the participants improved the symptoms with Paxlovid after 13 days, with placebo after 15 days.', 'With Paxlovid, 14 out of 1000 participants needed medical treatment for Covid-19 within a month, with placebo 76 out of 1000.', 'Whether with or without antibodies in the blood, Paxlovid basically protected all humans from a severe course.']",0,"The claim is supported by the sentences, as they indicate that Paxlovid provides protection from serious to fatal Covid-19 for unvaccinated individuals with risk factors, regardless of antibody presence.","In a large, well-done study, paxlovid prevented hospitalizations and deaths in high-risk patients. They were unvaccinated and had contracted the delta variant. For vaccinated people, the benefit cannot be reliably estimated. This also applies to people with immunodeficiency."
"Does starting school later improve health, learning success, and quality of life in adolescents?","['However, teenagers and parents now have to be very strong: despite 27 studies involving hundreds of thousands of students, no clear results can be derived from research.', 'The problem: The studies usually come to contradictory results.', 'So until better research results are available, all troubled young people and parents will only have the option of remaining out of bed early – or to hope that, despite lack of evidence, the school management will still have an insight into it.', 'It is difficult to examine whether a later start to school will have a positive effect.', 'The Problems: Unknown Influencing Factors: If differences occur in previous-after-studies, these do not have to be due to the later start of school – they may also have been caused by other changes over the course of the study period.']",1,"The claim cannot be definitively supported or refuted due to contradictory results from hundreds of thousands of students across 27 studies, and the presence of unknown influencing factors that could affect the outcomes.","The question has been investigated in several large studies. Due to methodological deficiencies and contradictory results, no firm conclusions can be drawn. This means that science can currently neither speak for nor against a benefit of a later school start."
Does the F.X. Mayr cure have health benefits? Can it prevent diseases or treat them?,"['Thus, the claim that the method can help with various diseases is not scientifically justified.', 'These studies cannot answer whether these changes also affect health.', 'Mayr cure or other fasting methods improve health in the long term, however, cannot be concluded.']",1,"The claim that the F.X. Mayr cure has health benefits or can prevent or treat diseases is not supported, as scientific justification is lacking and long-term health improvements from fasting methods like the Mayr cure are not conclusive.","It is neither examined nor proven whether the special fasting method after F.X. Mayr holds, which it promises: Namely assistance with all possible illnesses of allergies, over rheumatism up to sleep disturbances. The advertised detoxification and ""purification"" of the body by the chamfering cure are besides scientifically not plausible."
Does the consumption of soy foods or soy isoflavones affect the appearance of acne skin?,"['In both cases, certain soya ingredients are responsible for the effect on the skin: the isoflavones.', 'There are two competing theories that contradict each other: according to the first theory, isoflavones confuse the hormone balance and are supposed to promote acne in this way.', 'Surprisingly, despite searching in two large databases, we could not find a study on soy products and acne – whether soy milk, soy sauce or tofu.', 'The isoflavones improved the skin appearance more than an anti-acne cream with vitamin A acid (Tretinoin).', 'Conclusion: There is currently no evidence from reliable studies that soy makes acne worse.']",1,"While some studies suggest isoflavones in soy may impact skin appearance, there is currently no concrete evidence from reliable studies that soy exacerbates acne, as claimed.","We could not find any meaningful studies at all on the influence of soy foods on acne. On soy isoflavones, we found two small studies of questionable quality that examined a very specific group of sufferers. Soy isoflavones improved the skin appearance somewhat. However, this result is not reliable."
Does extract from the Damiana plant (Turnera diffusa) help with erectile dysfunction?,"['Efficacy does not appear to have been studied or demonstrated.', 'The studies in detail We could not find any studies on Damiana extract against erectile dysfunction in men.', 'Studies on the product Neradin also appear to be missing.']",1,"The claim that Damiana plant extract helps with erectile dysfunction is not supported by any studies, as mentioned in the sentences provided.","The extract from the Damiana plant (Turnera diffusa) is advertised as a remedy for erectile dysfunction for men. However, this claimed effect on potency is by no means proven. It has apparently never been tested on humans. This also applies to homeopathic remedies such as the product Neradin."
Does regular HPV testing in addition to the recommended Pap smear detect more precancerous lesions than just the Pap smear alone?,"['According to the studies, the HPV test is likely to detect slightly more precursors of cervical cancer over several years than the PAP swab alone.', 'We are therefore relatively sure that with an additional HPV test at least a little more precursors of uterine cancer are detected than only with the PAP swab alone.']",0,"The studies suggest that HPV testing detects slightly more precancerous lesions than the Pap smear alone over several years, supporting the claim.","Regular examination of the cervix by means of PAP smear tests detects precancerous stages of the cervix in most cases in good time. This reduces the risk of developing cervical cancer. An additional HPV test every three to five years can make screening even more reliable. However, the difference should not be too great."
Can monk's pepper reduce PMS symptoms? PMS is the abbreviation for premenstrual syndrome. This refers to complaints that occur in the days before menstruation.,"['Reference to efficacy in PMS According to previous studies, monk peppers could actually help in PMS.', 'The summarized study results indicate that the symptoms with monk pepper are reduced in more patients than with a sham medication (placebo).', 'Therefore, it would be possible for monk peppers to act against PMS symptoms such as breast spacing.']",0,The second sentence directly supports the claim by indicating that more patients experienced reduced PMS symptoms with monk pepper than with a placebo.,"In the studies to date, monk's pepper seems to relieve PMS symptoms better than a placebo. However, this is not well proven, because the studies have significant weaknesses. There is no evidence of an effect on menstrual disorders. Significant studies are lacking."
Can olive leaf extract reduce high blood pressure?,"['These studies therefore do not indicate whether olive leaf extract can help with significantly increased blood pressure.', 'Without success, however, we could not find any studies that investigated the effect of olive leaf extract on cardiovascular health.', 'However, they cannot provide clear answers.', 'It is therefore impossible to say whether olive leaves extract could have a better or worse effect with significantly increased blood pressure.']",1,"The claim cannot be supported or refuted as there is no substantial evidence indicating olive leaf extract's effect on significantly increased blood pressure, according to the provided sentences.","Whether olive leaf extract lowers blood pressure has been investigated in five suitable studies to date. They all found no effect or only a slight effect of the extract. The problem with this is that most of the study participants had only slightly elevated blood pressure. They cannot answer how olive leaf extract works in people with significantly elevated blood pressure (hypertension). The studies also had gross flaws, few participants, and ran for a very short time. They cannot provide reliable answers."
Do green-lipped mussel preparations improve the symptoms of osteoarthritis?,"['Studies overall not meaningful The conclusion of our research: Scientific evidence for the claimed effect is missing.', 'It is also unclear whether the measured positive effects are large enough to actually be felt by those affected.', 'Whether or not green-lipped mussel helps with osteoarthritis cannot be said at the moment.', 'However, as early as 2009, the European Food Safety Authority considered that a protective effect of the green-lipped mussel on healthy joints has not been established.', 'In our opinion, no reliable conclusions can be drawn from the studies found.']",1,"The claim that green-lipped mussel preparations improve osteoarthritis symptoms lacks scientific support and has unclear, insignificant effects based on the research findings.","The question was examined in four small studies with serious methodological deficiencies, which also arrived at partly contradictory results. No clear conclusions can be drawn from them. The claim that green-lipped mussel helps with osteoarthritis is not scientifically proven."
Can probiotics lower blood sugar in type 2 diabetes?,"['And if so, can probiotics reverse this change and reduce blood sugar levels again?', 'At the most small effect, they may actually be able to.', 'However, the effect of the capsules and tablets does not seem to be large: in the previous studies, they were able to reduce the long-term sugar level HbA1c by an average of 0.55 points.']",0,"While probiotics in capsule or tablet form may have a small effect in reducing HbA1c levels by an average of 0.55 points in type 2 diabetes, as suggested in the studies, it is unclear if they can reverse the change and reduce blood sugar levels to a significant extent.","The summarized results of studies to date suggest that probiotics in capsule or tablet form could lower blood sugar somewhat. At least if they are taken over a period of two to three months. However, the effect is not well established. Probiotic dairy products and probiotic powder for dissolving do not seem to have any demonstrable effect."
Can CBD (cannabidiol) help with migraines or other headaches?,"['Apparently, CBD has never been investigated to see if it can help with migraine seizures.', 'The claim that CBD would help with migraines or headaches is pure speculation.', 'The studies in detail Despite extensive search in three databases, we could not find any studies on CBD against migraine or other types of headache, neither for treatment nor for prevention.']",1,"The claim that CBD can help with migraines or headaches is not supported by the provided sentences, which indicate a lack of studies on this topic.",There are no studies that have investigated the effectiveness of CBD against migraine. So claims that CBD can help with or prevent migraine attacks have no scientific basis. The same is true for other types of headache.
Can laser irradiation of blood by infusion needle (hemolaser treatment) relieve discomfort or help with diseases?,"['It is also unclear by what mechanism blood irradiation with bundled red light – i.e.', 'red laser – should improve health.', 'Although the authors of the three studies found [1-3] claim to have established a clear efficacy of haemolaser treatment, none of the three studies is suitable to prove this.']",1,"The claim that laser irradiation of blood through an infusion needle can alleviate discomfort or aid in diseases is not supported by the provided sentences, as the mechanism by which this improves health is unclear, and the studies cited do not provide sufficient evidence to establish efficacy.",There is no scientific evidence that hemolaser treatment has a palliative or curative effect on health problems.
"In everyday life, when breathing with an FFP2 mask or ordinary mouth-nose protection, do you get as much oxygen as without a mask?","['As much oxygen as without a mask This fear is, however, unfounded, as previously conducted studies show [ 1,2 ].', 'Only in very strenuous sports (fast cycling to exhaustion) was the oxygen content in the blood with FFP2 mask slightly lower than without mask.', 'There was no difference in oxygen measurement with ordinary oral nose protection.', 'Breathing a little more strenuous The results thus contradict the rumor that masks would cause an oxygen deficiency.']",0,"The claim is supported by the sentences, as previous studies indicate that there is no significant difference in oxygen intake when wearing an FFP2 mask or ordinary mouth-nose protection, except for very strenuous sports, which does not apply to everyday life.","Even if breathing with a mask can feel uncomfortable: According to studies to date, you get just as much oxygen with an FFP2 mask or mouth-nose protection as without a mask. This is true even when you are moving or exerting yourself. Only very intensive sports slightly reduce the oxygen content in the blood - but too little to endanger health."
Can CBD help with period pain?,"['Because despite searching in three different databases we could not find a single study on CBD in case of regular pain.', 'Scientifically, it is not sufficiently researched whether CBD actually promotes sleep, as providers claim.', 'The studies in detail We could not find any studies that investigated whether CBD can help with normal pain – neither for treatment nor for prevention.']",1,"The claim that CBD can help with period pain is not supported by the provided sentences, as there is no scientific evidence found in three different databases regarding CBD's effectiveness for regular pain, including menstrual pain.",Whether CBD can relieve menstrual pain has apparently never been scientifically studied. We could not find any studies on this. Women who suffer from severe period pain should talk to a gynecologist about it. Diseases such as endometriosis could be behind it.
"Can a bioresonance device like ""Bioscan"" or ""Vieva Vital Analyser"" measure mineral and vitamin deficiencies or detect health problems?","['This experiment clearly shows that the devices studied are completely unsuitable to diagnose a lack of vitamins or minerals.', 'Sentenced for fraud at the end of May 2022, a German court also concluded that the Bioscan device cannot fulfil the claimed claims.', 'Claims for comparable products are equally implausible.', 'Even if 1000 subjects had participated in the study and only five to six people had shown such unreliable readings, such a device would be worthless for diagnostics.']",2,"The Bioscan device and similar products cannot measure mineral and vitamin deficiencies or detect health problems, as concluded by a German court and supported by an experiment showing their unreliability.","An experiment shows that the devices cannot distinguish between healthy people, seriously ill people and a corpse. The claimed mode of action behind the measurement method is also scientifically implausible. A German court has convicted the manufacturers of the Bioscan device (not legally binding) of fraud."
Will women who have recurrent bladder infections get rid of them faster if they take cranberry products only after the disease is already there???,"['There is also only evidence that cranberry products can prevent bladder inflammation for otherwise healthy women.', 'However, there does not seem to be any meaningful studies that have investigated this in women with recurrent bladder inflammation.', 'The preventive effect of cranberry in children, men and people with urinary catheters or certain diseases has not been studied.']",1,"While cranberry products have been shown to prevent bladder inflammation in healthy women, there is a lack of studies investigating their impact on women with recurrent bladder infections, making it unclear if they can help eliminate infections once they have already occurred.","Women who repeatedly have to deal with bladder infections might become ill somewhat less frequently if they regularly take cranberry juice or extract. However, this is not well established. And it only applies to uncomplicated bladder infections in otherwise healthy women. Whether cranberry products help when cystitis is already present remains unclear. This has not yet been investigated in meaningful studies."
Can extract from St. John's wort relieve the symptoms of depression? Is it similarly effective as drugs against depression (antidepressants)?,"[""St John's wort: effective in mild to moderate depression Probably yes."", ""In mild to moderate depression, St John's wort preparations probably work better than placebo."", ""St John's wort preparations are probably as good as antidepressants."", ""St. John's wort and antidepressants can relieve the discomfort, but the depression can probably not cure for good.""]",0,"The claim is supported by the sentences, as St. John's wort is suggested to be effective in mild to moderate depression, working better than placebo, and being as good as antidepressants, although it may not cure depression permanently.",St. John's wort is likely to relieve the symptoms of mild to moderate depression better than a placebo. It also appears to be similarly effective to approved medications for depression (antidepressants). St. John's wort preparations are generally better tolerated than antidepressants.
"Does the Zisano bracelet strengthen the immune system, increase endurance and performance or reduce fatigue?","['Whether such bracelets have an effect, for example whether they can actually increase physical performance or strengthen the immune system, has apparently never been investigated.', 'Bracelets for more performance: studies show ineffectiveness All five studies came to the same conclusion: the bracelets had no effect on the performance or well-being of the subjects.', 'A scientifically plausible explanation as to how exactly such bracelets should develop their effect remains to be found in their suppliers.', 'The studies in detail We could not find any studies on the Zisano bracelet or comparable bracelets with silicon chip.']",1,"The claim that the Zisano bracelet strengthens the immune system, increases endurance and performance, or reduces fatigue is not supported by the provided sentences, which mention a lack of scientific studies on the Zisano bracelet or similar products, and note that five studies found no effect of such bracelets on performance or well-being.","The promised positive effects of the ""Powerband"" wristband on health and well-being have apparently not been scientifically studied. We could not find any studies on this. It is also unclear how the wristband is supposed to work in concrete terms. A scientifically plausible explanation is missing."
"Does microimmunotherapy improve symptoms of allergies, cancer, joint inflammation, autoimmune diseases, dementia or various viral infections?","['None of these studies are meaningful – because they are poorly carried out and the published data are incomplete.', 'They cannot give any indication of the benefits of microimmune therapy.', 'Entitled doubts Since microimmune therapy preparations are highly diluted as homeopathic agents, we have fundamental doubts about the method.']",1,"The sentences express skepticism about microimmunotherapy's efficacy, citing study quality issues and the homeopathic nature of the preparations, which does not support the claim of improvement in various medical conditions.","So far, studies seem to exist only on microimmunotherapy against hay fever and cancer. Their significance is far too low to conclude that the therapy is effective. We found no studies on other health problems. Thus, there is no proven benefit of microimmunotherapy for any disease."
Can ginkgo extract improve mental performance in dementia patients?,"['Dementia patients taking Ginkgo extract often seemed to perform better in thinking, memory, and concentration tasks than those who swallowed placebo preparations without an active substance [1.3].', 'Although the studies indicate that Ginkgo extract can help people with dementia, the significance of the individual studies is limited.']",0,"The first sentence supports the claim that Ginkgo extract may improve mental performance in dementia patients, but the second sentence suggests the significance of individual studies is limited, indicating potential inconsistency or uncertainty in the evidence.",Previous studies suggest that ginkgo extract can improve mental performance in dementia - but this is not well established. It is not possible to say exactly how large this effect is.
Does pine wood improve sleep?,"['So there is no indication that the pine wood improves sleep.', 'The importance of these laboratory measurements for the sleep of the participants is unclear – even if the researchers interpret them as positive effects of the circling bed.', 'Whether a pine bed actually improves sleep would have to study more rigorous studies carried out according to scientific criteria on significantly more subjects in the future.The studies in detail [1,2] Grote et al.']",1,"While two studies are mentioned [1,2], the first sentence directly refutes the claim that pine wood improves sleep, stating there is no indication of such an effect.","So far, only one small study has investigated this question. However, the results of this study are not conclusive due to numerous deficiencies in the conduct of the study."
Do spermidine supplements or a spermidine-rich diet reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia? Do they help with existing dementia?,"['Spermidin studies: not enough as evidence of efficacy Even if both studies had come to overwhelmingly positive results, we would still have concerns about their significance.', 'Spermidine, which is additionally absorbed by food, is not sufficiently researched at the present time.', 'The number of participants is low and the risk is high that the results are not transferable to reality.', 'We do not consider the study to be meaningful.', 'Results: Both the spermidine group and the comparator group had fewer dementia symptoms and better mental performance at the end of the study.']",1,"The claim is not sufficiently supported by the provided sentences, as the studies on spermidine's effects on dementia symptoms have low participant numbers, increasing the risk that the results may not be transferable to reality, and spermidine's efficacy is not yet thoroughly researched.","Manufacturers of spermidine drugs advertise an alleged positive effect on mental performance and protection against dementia. However, such an effect has not been proven in meaningful studies. We found a single study in which dementia patients had participated. However, their results are not very clear."
Do green-lipped mussel preparations improve the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis?,"['For us, therefore, this claim is not credible.', 'Whether green-lipped mussel helps with rheumatism or not, can therefore not be said for sure at the moment.', 'Whether the results can be transferred to other products or other dosages is unclear.', ""The studies are all badly done according to today's standard: so it is unclear how reliable the measurements of the treatment success are."", 'Whether rheumatism patients would still benefit from green-lipped mussel preparations remains unclear.']",1,"The claim is not supported by the sentences, as there is no certainty about the effectiveness of green-lipped mussel preparations for rheumatoid arthritis due to unreliable studies and unclear transferability of results.","Five small studies provide no overall evidence of benefit from green-lipped mussel in rheumatism. However, the rheumatism treatment of the participants does not meet today's standards and the studies were very poorly conducted. Therefore, we cannot draw any reliable conclusions from these studies."
Does the pill affect the muscle strength of women??,"['Does the pill also affect muscle strength?', 'The available studies do not provide any indication of such an effect.']",2,"The claim that the pill affects women's muscle strength is not supported by the provided sentences, which state that current studies do not indicate such an effect.","Taking the pill could possibly impair endurance performance in sports somewhat. However, there are no indications of less muscle strength due to the pill. However, these - somewhat contradictory - findings are anything but certain. Whether the somewhat reduced endurance performance speaks against contraception with the pill, each athlete must decide for herself - depending on how important top athletic performance is for her."
Does transcranial pulse stimulation (TPS) improve mental performance in people with Alzheimer's dementia? Can the treatment improve the quality of life of those affected?,"['Therefore, we do not consider the study results to be meaningful.', ""Transcranial pulse stimulation: not recognized as Alzheimer's therapy Even if providers of transcranial pulse stimulation claim otherwise: as therapy, the treatment with ultrasound in dementia is neither researched nor recognized."", 'There are currently no studies that can prove that it can help people with dementia in the short term or in the long term.', 'None of the studies can answer whether transcranial pulse stimulation or similar procedures help people with dementia.']",1,"The claim is not supported because there are no studies showing short-term or long-term benefits of transcranial pulse stimulation for people with dementia, and it is not recognized as a therapy for Alzheimer's.",Whether transcranial pulse stimulation can help people with Alzheimer's dementia has not yet been investigated in meaningful studies. Possible harmful effects have also been insufficiently researched.
Can low-level laser therapy reduce wrist osteoarthritis pain?,"['There is a well-made study on wrist arthritis: it showed no difference in efficacy between low-level laser therapy and placebo treatment.', 'This was not the case, the laser treatment could not relieve the pain better than placebo treatment.']",2,"The claim that low-level laser therapy can reduce wrist osteoarthritis pain is refuted by the provided sentences, which state that a study showed no difference in efficacy between laser therapy and placebo treatment.","In the pain treatment of wrist osteoarthritis, no efficacy can be assumed - this is indicated by the results of a small but well-done study. Research results on knee osteoarthritis are contradictory and therefore of little significance. We did not find any reliable studies on hip osteoarthritis."
Does blood type affect the likelihood that Covid 19 disease will take a severe course or lead to death?,"['Here, the results found seem to contradict the influence of the blood group on the probability of death: the researchers found no connection between certain blood groups and the severity of the disease.', 'Overall, the available data are not meaningful enough to establish or exclude a relationship between the blood group and the course of covid-19 disease.', 'It is certain that no one is protected from a serious Covid-19 history because of their type of blood.', 'No evidence of severe progression in certain blood groups The researchers found no evidence that in the case of a Covid-19 disease, people with a particular blood group need to be treated more frequently in hospital or intensive care units.']",1,"The claim that blood type affects the severity of Covid-19 disease is not supported by the provided sentences, which indicate no connection between blood groups and disease severity or hospitalization rates.",There is no reliable evidence that people with a certain blood group are more severely affected by covid-19 than those with another. Study results on this are poorly substantiated and partly contradictory.
Does CBD (cannabidiol) relieve symptoms of mild to moderate covid-19 disease?,"[""We can't say with absolute certainty that CBD is ineffective at Covid-19, but we think it is reasonably probable."", 'In addition, there is evidence from other studies that CBD may even increase the susceptibility to infection [4].', 'Although she appears in some media reports, the report is simply wrong that the researchers had demonstrated an anti-corona effect of CBD in their study: According to the research team, CBD had no effect on the corona virus in the experiments.', 'No benefit from CBD After 28 days, the study team took stock: Overall, the participants of the CBD group felt no better than those of the placebo group.']",2,"The claim that CBD relieves symptoms of mild to moderate Covid-19 disease is refuted by the study team's statement that participants who took CBD felt no better than those who took a placebo, and by the report that CBD may even increase susceptibility to infection.","CBD is unlikely to have any effect on the symptoms of covid-19 disease. This is the conclusion of the only study that has investigated this. However, its validity is somewhat limited due to the small number of participants. Not explored is a possible preventive effect. It is unclear whether CBD or other cannabis constituents - ingested or smoked - protect against corona infection or covid-19 disease."
Do sedatives and sleeping pills such as benzodiazepines and related substances increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease or other forms of dementia?,"['However, it cannot be clearly dispelled by the fact that benzodiazepines and similar substances could promote the development of dementia.']",1,"The sentence suggests a potential link between benzodiazepines and dementia, aligning with the claim but not providing sufficient evidence to strongly support or refute it.","A link between the long-term use of sedatives and sleeping pills and the development of dementia cannot be ruled out. However, whether the drugs are the cause of dementia is unclear. Likewise, it is possible that studies show a connection only because people in the undiagnosed early stages of dementia suffer more frequently from sleep disorders or restlessness and therefore take medication against them more often."
"Does taking polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as omega-3 and omega-6, reduce ADHD symptoms in children?","['Overall, the preparations do not seem to make children with ADHD quieter and more concentrated.', 'Whether omega fatty acid preparations or placebo, all children showed similarly strong ADHD symptoms.', 'On closer examination, it appears that the best-performed, blinded studies show no or even a negative effect of the omega fatty acid preparations on the behaviour of the participating children.']",2,"The claim is refuted by the sentences, as they suggest that omega fatty acid preparations, including omega-3 and omega-6, do not reduce ADHD symptoms in children, and may even have a negative effect on their behavior.","Studies to date suggest that supplements containing polyunsaturated fatty acids (for example, omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids) tend not to have a noticeable effect on attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, the quality of the studies is not sufficient to provide definitive answers."
Do infusions of vitamin C relieve symptoms of chronic fatigue or long covid?,"['It is also unclear whether people with Long Covid benefit from vitamin C infusions.', 'One of the two authors is also an employee of a pharmaceutical company that also offers products with vitamin C.  Since the developmental mechanisms of both chronic fatigue syndrome and long covid are unclear, studies with cancer patients or healthy participants cannot provide answers to the question whether vitamin C can help people with chronic fatigue syndrome or long covid.']",1,"The claim remains unclear since there is no direct evidence provided about the benefits of vitamin C infusions for people with chronic fatigue or long covid, and one author's affiliation with a pharmaceutical company offering vitamin C products could introduce bias.",Whether vitamin C infusions help with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is questionable. This has not yet been scientifically investigated. We also could not find a single study on vitamin C and fatigue occurring in the context of Long Covid.
Does taking probiotics shorten the duration of acute infectious diarrhea?,"['Thus, at least in children, taking live probiotics is unlikely to affect whether they are still ill after 48 hours.', 'Thus, a probiotic apparently has no clear influence on the resolution of the disease.']",2,"The sentences suggest that probiotics do not have a clear influence on resolving acute infectious diarrhea in children within 48 hours, which contradicts the claim of probiotics potentially shortening the duration of the disease.","According to current studies, the duration of disease cannot be reduced by taking probiotics. This assessment is reasonably well supported."
Does high-dose vitamin D slow down the course of disease in multiple sclerosis (MS)?,"['However, such observations alone are not sufficient to actually demonstrate the benefit of highly dosed vitamin D in MS.   Studies on vitamin D in MS We have therefore been looking for meaningful studies on the high-dose treatment of vitamin D in multiple sclerosis.', 'At present, we cannot say for sure whether highly dosed vitamin D actually brings benefits to MS.', 'However, the data so far suggest that an effect, if any, would be rather small.']",1,"The claim that high-dose vitamin D slows down the course of disease in MS is not definitively supported by the provided sentences, which suggest there is currently insufficient evidence to confirm a significant benefit.","We can neither clearly exclude nor confirm that there is an effect. In a total of 15 studies, no benefit could be demonstrated for high-dose vitamin D in adults with multiple sclerosis. Because the studies had many weaknesses, we cannot draw any conclusions about positive or negative effects."
"Can ozone therapy, in which autologous blood is treated with ozone and recycled, favorably influence the course of COVID-19 disease?","['There are no differences between standard treatment and additional ozone therapy – neither in the progression of Covid-19 disease nor in the risk of death.', 'An advantage for ozone therapy did not arise, for none of the comparisons there was a clear difference: neither for the risk of death to Covid-19 nor for the course of the disease [5].', 'Thus, the sole effect of autologous ozone therapy has not been established here either.']",1,"The sentences provide evidence that ozone therapy does not show a clear advantage over standard treatment in reducing the risk of death or improving the course of COVID-19 disease, which contradicts the claim of a favorable influence.",The few studies on this subject have gross deficiencies and are therefore not conclusive. Their results do not provide any evidence of efficacy of ozone therapy.
Does dimenhydrinate relieve travel nausea better than a placebo?,"['However, we are very sceptical here: we consider the results to be so little meaningful that we can neither see any evidence of effectiveness nor exclude it.', 'In general, it remains questionable how reliable the results can be transferred to other situations where travel sickness occurs.', 'However, we do not consider this assessment to be meaningful: the number of test subjects was far too small, and, therefore, the fluctuation range was far too large.']",1,The small number of test subjects and large fluctuation range make it difficult to rely on the study's results or draw conclusions about dimenhydrinate's effectiveness in relieving travel nausea compared to a placebo.,"The best available studies on the subject are unfortunately not conclusive, for example because they were quite small and the publications lack many details for traceability.  Therefore, we can neither prove nor exclude an effect."
Does dimenhydrinate relieve travel nausea as well as the proven drug scopolamine???,"['According to study authors, dimenhydrinate is supposed to help better than a placebo but has a worse effect than the proven drug Scopolamine.']",1,"The claim that dimenhydrinate relieves travel nausea as well as scopolamine is not supported, as stated by the study authors, who found dimenhydrinate to have a worse effect than scopolamine.","The best available studies on the subject are unfortunately not conclusive, for example because they were quite small and the publications lack many details for traceability.  Therefore, we can neither prove nor exclude an effect."
Does short-term fasting reduce the side effects of chemotherapy for cancer???,"['On this basis, we cannot reliably say whether fasting during chemotherapy is actually useful or not, thus reducing side effects and improving the quality of life.', 'Whether fasting prevents or mitigates the side effects of chemotherapy is also not clear from the results: In one of the studies [1a] there was no difference in side effects such as fatigue or nerve pain: they were similarly common and similarly severe in both groups.', 'All of this means that the results of the studies are extremely uncertain and we cannot see or exclude the effectiveness of fasting.']",1,"The claim that short-term fasting reduces the side effects of chemotherapy for cancer is not supported, as the studies show unclear results with no significant difference in side effects between fasting and non-fasting groups.",We found only three very small studies on both questions. Their results are so unreliable that we cannot make any assessment. So we cannot say whether the quality of life of those affected is improved and whether fasting during chemotherapy reduces side effects.
Are extracts of Artemisa annua (annual mugwort) or the active ingredient artemisinin obtained from it effective against coronavirus?,"['We have not found any studies to prevent Corona infection.', 'However, it has several inconsistencies, so it cannot answer whether Artemisia helps the sick.', 'However, the limited anti-malaria effect of artemisinin does not indicate efficacy against other diseases.', 'For several reasons, we do not consider these results to be reliable: The standard treatment differed greatly: some of the participants received, for example, cortisone-containing drugs that are known to be effective, while others did not.']",1,"The claim remains unsupported as there is no evidence provided for Artemisia annua or artemisinin preventing Corona infection, its effectiveness in helping the sick is inconsistent, and the limited anti-malaria effect of artemisinin does not necessarily indicate efficacy against other diseases, moreover, the reliability of the results is questioned due to varying standard treatments.","To date, only one study can be found that investigated Artemisia treatment in mild covid-19 progression. However, due to numerous shortcomings, the results are not conclusive. It has not been studied whether Artemisia helps or prevents severe covid 19 disease or whether the plant can prevent coronavirus infection."
Can zinc mitigate the progression of Covid-19?,"['Thus zinc should not cause Covid-19 sufferers to get better more quickly [3].', 'However, compared to the other half that did not take zinc, they did not recover faster.', 'So these results suggest that zinc treatment at Covid-19 is not helpful.']",2,"The claim that zinc can mitigate the progression of Covid-19 is refuted by the sentences, as there is no evidence suggesting that zinc treatment leads to faster recovery in Covid-19 patients compared to those not taking zinc.",The results of two studies on this suggest that sufferers with Covid-19 do not recover more quickly with zinc than without. A preventive effect has not yet been investigated in studies.
Does a cold spray with trypsin protect against colds or covid-19? Does the spray reduce symptoms and duration of illness?,"['No previously published study has investigated whether the cold spray can prevent a disease.', 'Thus, it is not certain that the cold spray shortens the duration of a cold.', 'If you look at the number of people who report cold complaints after artificial infection (21 out of 23 in the spray group, 16 out of 23 in the placebo group), there is no clear difference that speaks for a preventive effect of the cold spray.', 'Therefore, we do not consider the results of the study meaningful: With spray, the participants assessed the duration of their cold shorter (7.7 days) than without spray (10.4 days).', 'Interestingly, there was no clear difference between the two groups: The spray group did not reach much less to other colds than the control group.']",1,"The claim that a cold spray with trypsin protects against colds or COVID-19 and reduces symptoms and duration of illness is not supported, as no clear difference in cold prevention was found between the spray and placebo groups, and self-reported cold duration in the spray group was shorter, but deemed not meaningful by the study.",The question was investigated in two small studies with gross deficiencies. They cannot prove that treatment with the cold spray relieves symptoms or shortens the duration of illness. Whether the spray has a preventive effect has not been researched for either colds or Covid-19.
"Does injecting low-dose Corona vaccine into the skin (mesotherapy vaccination, microvaccination) protect against Covid-19 as well as proven full-dose vaccination into muscle?","['Whether the mesotherapy vaccination against the coronavirus protects against a covid-19 disease is not researched.', 'Whether Corona vaccination by mesotherapy provides effective protection against Covid-19 remains unclear.']",1,"The claim that skin injection of low-dose Corona vaccine offers the same protection as full-dose muscle vaccination is not supported, as there is no research yet on mesotherapy vaccination's effectiveness against Covid-19, leaving protection uncertain.","Some doctors offer corona vaccination using the so-called mesotherapeutic method. Here, vaccination is administered into the skin instead of into the upper arm muscle, with a fraction of the tested and approved dose. Such applications have not been explored for the Corona vaccines. Effective protection against Covid-19 is not assured."
Do herbal remedies with nasturtium and horseradish (Kren) prevent recurrent cystitis?,"['In the prevention study, it can be seen that the herbal product and the sham medication did not differ significantly in the case of symptoms such as nausea or allergic reactions [1].', 'According to this, the capuchin cress-meerrettiche preparation probably does not offer any preventive protection.']",2,"The claim is refuted by the sentences provided, as they suggest that the herbal product containing nasturtium and horseradish does not provide significant preventive protection against symptoms such as nausea or allergic reactions, which are relevant to the context of recurrent cystitis prevention.","As for prevention, we have found only one small but somewhat reliable study. According to this, nasturtium-horseradish remedies probably cannot prevent cystitis. For the treatment of cystitis, we were also only able to evaluate one study.

Can Artemisia tea cure malaria as well as drugs?,"['And even if there were no problems with resistance – it is questionable whether Artemisia remedies from non-professional self-cultivation could reliably compete with the standardized quality of artemisinin drugs.', 'Based on the studies available to us, we can neither clearly demonstrate nor completely exclude the benefit of Artemisia tea for sustainable malaria treatment with low relapse probability.']",1,"The claim that Artemisia tea can cure malaria as well as drugs is not clearly supported by the provided sentences, as one states the difficulty in reliably competing with standardized artemisinin drugs, and the other indicates unclear or partially excluded benefits for sustainable malaria treatment with low relapse probability.","Four studies with a total of relatively few participants come to contradictory results. Since all studies have problems, we cannot draw any meaningful conclusions about the healing success - i.e., we can neither confirm nor exclude a positive lasting effect."
Does thyme help against cough?,"[""We couldn't find a single clinical trial that investigated exclusively thyme for an effect against cough."", 'Conjectures without evidence Although it is not proven that ingredients of the thyme can actually relieve cough, it is also not refuted.', 'However, there is no scientific evidence to date that the mucus solution itself has a relieving or shortening effect on cough [7,8].', 'Therefore, it cannot be said directly whether thyme alone can relieve cough.']",1,"While there is no clinical trial evidence specifically investigating thyme's effect on cough, and no scientific proof of its mucus solution relieving or shortening cough, it remains unproven but also unrefuted that thyme's ingredients can alleviate cough.",Whether thyme is effective against cough has not yet been researched in meaningful studies.

Since the studies are quite old, it is also not possible to assess how strophanthin compares with modern, well-studied drugs."
Can regular intake of vitamin C prevent colds?,"['Although those who swallow vitamin C preventatively are probably a little shorter ill in case of a cold, the effect seems small: With an average duration of seven days of disease, vitamin C would reduce to six to six and a half days of disease.', 'A clear advantage was not shown – the number of participants who had been cold was hardly lower with vitamin C than with placebo.']",2,"The claim that regular intake of vitamin C can prevent colds is refuted by the sentences, as they indicate while it may reduce the duration of a cold slightly, there is no clear advantage in terms of reducing the number of people who contract a cold when comparing vitamin C to a placebo.","Preventive intake of high-dose vitamin C for a long time does not prevent the occurrence of colds. However, it can reduce the average duration of illness by half a day to a day from a week. Vitamin C is unlikely to improve a cold that has already occurred."
Can taking vitamin C after the onset of a cold relieve symptoms or shorten the illness?,"['Symptom treatment probably without effect The recommendation to take high-dose vitamin C at the first signs of a cold cannot be confirmed by studies.', 'The combined results of previous studies do not show that vitamin C can relieve cold symptoms.']",2,"The claim that vitamin C can relieve cold symptoms or shorten the illness is refuted by the combined results of previous studies, which do not show any symptom relief from vitamin C.","Preventive intake of high-dose vitamin C for a long time does not prevent the occurrence of colds.

Does ACE inhibitors like ramipril increase the risk of lung cancer?,"['Contradictory results Previous studies also had problems in providing a clear answer.', 'The research has produced contradictory results: in some cases, the risk of lung cancer was increased with ACE inhibitors, decreased or not altered in others.', 'Therefore, it is not certain whether the relationship found is really due to the ACE inhibitors.']",1,"The claim remains unresolved as research studies have shown contradictory results with some indicating an increased risk, decreased risk, or no change in lung cancer risk with ACE inhibitors like ramipril.","A large observational study has found an increased risk of lung cancer with long-term use of ACE inhibitors compared with another group of antihypertensive drugs. However, other causes for this association cannot be completely ruled out. Previous studies have reached inconsistent results. Therefore, it can currently neither be confirmed nor ruled out that the risk of lung cancer may increase with ACE inhibitors. Even if further studies should really confirm the increased risk, the effect is likely to be rather small."

Is Intermittent Fasting suitable for reducing excess weight as well as a conventional low calorie diet?,"['Effective as long-term diet According to this, interval fasting is probably effective in reducing body weight in overweight and obese adults.', 'How well interval fasting works over a longer period of time (more than a year) and what undesirable effects it can have – unfortunately, this is hardly researched at all.', 'The studies in detail Our research has shown that intermittent fasting (also: intermittent fasting) is likely to be effective for weight loss in overweight or obese people.']",0,"While the studies suggest intermittent fasting can be effective for weight loss in overweight or obese adults, there is limited research on its long-term effects and potential undesirable effects, making it difficult to directly compare with a conventional low-calorie diet.","Intermittent fasting (also: intermittent fasting) is probably effective for losing weight. In terms of weight reduction, there are probably no clear differences from a conventional diet in which calories are permanently reduced. Both paths can lead to weight reductions that are significant for health. The current assessment is based mainly on studies over a maximum of 12 months with middle-aged women from affluent countries. Long-term effects and adverse effects of intermittent fasting still need to be better studied."
"Is the risk for the brain inflammation SSPE as a consequence of measles disease greater than long assumed?

Can perineal massage during pregnancy help prevent birth injury in first-time mothers?,"['Some First Bearers Benefit According to these studies [1,2], women who massage their dam before birth for prevention are likely to have a slightly lower risk of certain birth injuries.', 'According to this, some women who give birth to vaginally for the first time can probably benefit from a dam massage – which is probably due to a little less injuries.', 'These points limit our confidence in the results.', 'Nevertheless, the team of authors identified a similar trend as the large survey work [1] : According to this, the prenatal dam massage should reduce the number of dam cuts and other injuries in first births.']",0,"The claim is partially supported by the sentences, as some studies suggest a lower risk of certain birth injuries for first-time mothers who perform perineal massage, but the team's confidence is limited due to certain points and the need for more information.",The study evidence to date shows that perineal birth injuries are likely to be somewhat reduced in the group of women having a baby for the first time. This is due in particular to the fact that fewer perineal incisions were performed. The positive effect could not be shown for women who had already had a vaginal delivery.
Can cancer be effectively treated with vitamin C infusions?,"['Overall, the study shows that swallowing high doses of vitamin C probably does not help in cancer.', 'Instead, infusions are indicated – the aim is to achieve a higher concentration of vitamin in the blood and cancer tissue than is possible by swallowing vitamin C.

Is belly fat or is a large abdominal girth particularly dangerous for health?,"['In contrast to bacon rolls and pads, which sit on thighs, arms or hips, the belly fat seems to be ""more active"" than other fat deposits: it may be mixed in different processes of the organism unfavorable.', 'New predictive tool in the test In a systematic review of studies on a total of just under 690,000 people, it emerged that an over-exploiting belly may indicate an increased risk of death [1].', 'Thus, a thick belly makes it more susceptible to cardiovascular and respiratory diseases.']",0,Belly fat's potential involvement in various unfavorable processes and its association with increased mortality risk and susceptibility to cardiovascular and respiratory diseases support the claim of its danger to health.,"Current studies suggest that fat deposits in the abdomen (""visceral fat˝) may increase the risk of premature death. It is possible that individuals with unremarkable body mass index are also at risk. In the coming years, new studies will probably allow a better assessment."
"Can choline ingested with food - alone or in the form of lecithin, for example - improve memory?","['However, the study did not provide clear evidence that choline is the cause of better memory performance.', 'Poor study quality Two other studies investigated how the uptake of pure choline in the form of food additives affects brain performance.', 'However, the significance of the two studies is limited: only very few subjects had taken part in the methodologically poor studies.', 'However, this result cannot be transferred to people with normal diets: with daily food, most of us absorb at least moderate amounts of choline.', 'Conclusion: great uncertainty Overall, a memory-promoting effect of choline or lecithin from food cannot be reliably demonstrated.']",1,"While some studies have explored the impact of pure choline as a food additive on brain performance, their significance is limited due to few participants and the results cannot be generalized to those with normal diets, who typically consume moderate amounts of choline, providing uncertainty about choline or lecithin from food improving memory.",Studies conducted to date provide no clear indication of whether supplemental intake of choline leads to improved memory in healthy people or in people with dementia who are not choline deficient.
Does white sugar cause cancer?,"['However, this does not mean that sugar in itself is a direct risk factor and causes cancer.', 'Despite already extensive research, the exact role sugar plays and whether it represents an additional risk, apart from its contribution to the calorie balance, has to be examined even better and more comprehensively.', 'However, not all the causes have yet been clarified and above all, coincidence seems to play a major role: ""For many tumors, random errors in cell division are responsible, which cannot be prevented,"" says the German Cancer Research Center.', 'Overall, there is no scientific evidence that sugar significantly affects the risk of cancer.', 'The studies therefore do not allow a statement as to whether a sugary diet can cause cancer.']",1,"While there is no definitive scientific evidence directly linking white sugar to an increased risk of cancer, its role in calorie balance and potential indirect effects require further investigation.","Studies on white sugar cannot be found, but a link between sugar in general and cancer has also not been established."

Does turmeric prevent or cure cancer?,"['However, well-executed studies of this kind have so far been scarce.', 'After 6 months of administration, the values did not differ between turmeric and dummy subjects.', 'This makes it unclear whether any improvement observed is due to turmeric treatment or whether the health status of the study participants would have improved without turmeric.']",1,"The absence of significant differences between turmeric and dummy subjects after 6 months, as well as the scarcity of well-controlled studies, makes it unclear if any observed improvements are a result of turmeric treatment or would have occurred without it, thus not providing clear support for the claim of cancer prevention or cure.",Animal studies provide tentative evidence that turmeric can prevent or treat cancer. Whether turmeric has such an effect in humans cannot be assessed due to the low confidence level of a few studies conducted to date.
"Do boron preparations such as borax, boric acid, or calcium fructoborate relieve pain associated with age-related joint wear (osteoarthritis)?","['Even if their authors want to give a positive impression in their work – a critical look at the data shows that the Borax tablets could not alleviate arthrosis complaints among the participants.', 'There is no evidence that borax or boric acid can actually improve the discomfort in people with worn joints.', 'Those who suffer from chronic osteoarthritis pains and stiff joints and are hoping for relief through Borax should rely on more effective alternatives.']",1,"The claim that boron preparations like borax or boric acid alleviate pain associated with osteoarthritis is not supported by the sentences, which mention the inability of Borax to reduce arthrosis complaints and the lack of evidence for borax or boric acid improving discomfort in people with worn joints.","The few studies on this are of poor quality and therefore not trustworthy. Moreover, there is no evidence that the human body needs boron at all."
Can glutamate in food cause intolerance symptoms?,"['There are many case reports of an alleged glutamate hypersensitivity, but these can hardly be verified.', 'But among the alleged glutamate-sensitive subjects there was no one who showed symptoms after all glutamate [3].', 'The available studies show that up to three grams of glutamate does not cause symptoms in a selected group of healthy individuals.']",1,"While there are claims of glutamate hypersensitivity, no individual in a selected group showed symptoms after consuming all glutamate, and up to three grams of glutamate did not cause symptoms in healthy individuals, providing insufficient evidence to directly support or refute the claim of glutamate in food causing intolerance symptoms.","There is no conclusive evidence that the consumption of glutamate triggers complaints. However, since studies conducted to date have shown deficiencies, it cannot be ruled out that there are isolated individuals who react sensitively to large amounts of glutamate."
Does the Orthopulse device accelerate the orthodontic correction of malocclusions?,"['Little meaningful The three published studies [1-3] cannot convince: None of the studies actually investigates the entire duration of treatment, but only the speed of tooth movements in the correction phase of brace therapy.', 'This does not make any sure statements about the reduction of the overall duration of treatment with which the manufacturer advertises.', 'Theoretically, two effects of orthopulses would be conceivable: positive effects if the duration of treatment were shortened, or negative effects if conversion processes at the tooth root were accelerated.', 'Thus, it is also questionable whether the faster treatment with the orthopulse device actually results from infrared therapy: In the control group, the teeth move on average by 0.44 mm per week, in the group with the orthopulse device on average by 1.27 mm per week.']",1,"While the studies mentioned do not cover the entire treatment duration and there is a theoretical possibility of negative effects, the data shows a significant increase in weekly tooth movement with the Orthopulse device, which may suggest a shortened treatment duration.",Poorly done studies show that the device can accelerate tooth movement in the short term. Whether this reduces the overall treatment time has not yet been sufficiently proven. The methodological weaknesses of the studies also mean that the results are not very credible. Possible side effects have not yet been sufficiently investigated.
Are vegetables prepared in a microwave oven less healthy than those prepared in other ways?,"['Recent studies see the matter more differentiated: Depending on the variety of vegetables and the exact type of preparation, the microwave can sometimes be better and sometimes worse suited than, for example, cooking [2-12].', 'In the worst case, if it is exaggerated with the duration and the number of watts, the corresponding food is less health-promoting, but in no way harmful to health.', 'If there are health problems related to the microwave, then this is not because the microwave ingredients are destroyed or changed, but because it is simply too unhealthy to eat altogether.', 'The week-long feeding with always several times warmed up in the microwave has not led to any signs of poisoning in the animals.']",2,"While the microwave can sometimes be less suitable than other methods for preparing vegetables, depending on the type and duration of cooking, there is no evidence that it destroys or changes ingredients in a way that makes vegetables harmful to health, even after prolonged warming.","How vegetables change during preparation is extremely variable. With any type of heating, ingredients can be lost or become more easily accessible. In sum, it cannot be said that preparation in the microwave is always a bad choice."
Can garlic extract reduce high blood pressure and thus the risk of cardiovascular disease?,"['Two better performed randomised-controlled studies provide cautious evidence that garlic can lower too high blood pressure [1].', 'However, even the results of these two studies are insufficiently valid for a clear assessment [1].', 'Whether garlic taken regularly can lower too high blood pressure and thus lower the risk of cardiovascular disease remains unclear for the time being.', 'At least in theory, there may also be interactions with anticoagulant drugs or side effects in persons with a tendency to bleed, as garlic is suspected to have an anticoagulant effect.']",1,"While two studies suggest garlic can lower high blood pressure, their validity is questioned, leaving unclear whether regular garlic use reduces cardiovascular disease risk, and potentially interacting with anticoagulant drugs or causing side effects in those prone to bleeding due to garlic's suspected anticoagulant effect.","Studies to date provide tentative evidence of a blood pressure-lowering effect of garlic. However, they are of too low quality to be able to prove a reduction in the risk of cardiovascular disease as a result of high blood pressure."

However, for both migraine and tension headaches, acupuncture performs only slightly better than sham acupuncture. Whether the pricking of traditional acupuncture points plays a role is unclear."
Can green tea reduce the likelihood of dying from cancer ?,"['In some studies, there was indeed a slightly reduced probability of disease, but other studies even suggested an increased risk of cancer from the use of green tea.', 'The result provides sobering clarity: people who regularly drink large amounts of green tea die in sum as often at some kind of cancer as people who hardly touch green tea [8].', 'To a degree harmless Although the benefits of green tea against cancer are questionable, there is no evidence of a health-impairing effect in moderate consumption of some cups a day [2].']",2,"While some studies suggest a slight reduction in cancer probability with green tea consumption, other studies indicate an increased risk, and overall, regular intake doesn't seem to affect cancer-related mortality rates.",The results of previous studies suggest that green tea cannot reduce the risk of dying from cancer.
Can plant sterols or foods with them reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease?,"['However, it is unclear whether the intake of such high amounts of plant sterols – e.g.', 'Whether these results are a coincidence or whether the higher rate of cardiovascular problems are actually due to plant sterols and not to other causes is unclear.', 'Cholesterol is also different Whether plant sterols can actually reduce not only LDL cholesterol levels, but also the risk of cardiovascular diseases, has not been investigated in a single clinical study.']",1,"While plant sterols have been shown to lower LDL cholesterol levels, there is no clinical study demonstrating that they can reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases specifically, leaving uncertainty about their role in cardiovascular disease prevention.","Plant sterols do lower cholesterol levels. However, whether they also reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease has not been researched. Animal studies even provide evidence that plant sterols in large quantities could increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. Whether this also applies to humans has not been investigated."
Can too much iodine cause autoimmune thyroid disease and consequently hypothyroidism?,"['Individual studies suggest that too large amounts of iodine may be responsible.', 'Probably a variety of causes These study results suggest that Hashimoto disease is more likely to occur in people with particularly high iodine consumption.', 'However, large amounts of iodine may cause serious disturbances in people with potentially undetected thyroid problems [8].', 'The studies in detail Whether large amounts of iodine can actually cause inflammation of the thyroid gland by an overreacting immune system is not well protected.', 'The result: the higher the iodine intake in a region, the greater the proportion of residents who suffer from autoimmune thyroid inflammation.']",0,"High iodine intake correlates with increased autoimmune thyroid inflammation, potentially triggering hypothyroidism in individuals with preexisting thyroid issues, although the exact mechanism is not well-established.",Autoimmune thyroid disease appears to occur more frequently in individuals with high iodine consumption. Whether high levels of iodine actually cause this disease has not been conclusively determined.
Is the sweetener aspartame harmful to health?,"['The result: the sweetener is in all probability safe.', 'Safety levels Based on the results of numerous studies in laboratory animals and humans, the scientists established a safety limit for aspartame.', 'Thus, every person can take 40 milligrams per kilogram of body weight every day for the rest of his life without fear of health consequences.', 'Even those who exceed this amount will not suffer any health hazard.']",2,"Based on the results of numerous studies, scientists have set a safety limit for aspartame, indicating that it is unlikely to be harmful to health even when consumed daily at levels above the established limit.","Health damage from aspartame is unlikely.

Does coffee affect cancer death risk?,"['Both studies concluded that coffee consumption has no effect on cancer mortality.', 'In other words, coffee generally does not seem to favor or prevent death through cancer.', 'For breast cancer, prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer and bladder cancer there seems to be no association with the consumption of coffee.', 'Conclusion: Coffee consumption does not seem to affect cancer mortality.', 'They did not detect any influence of coffee on the number of cancer deaths.']",2,"The claim that coffee affects cancer death risk is refuted by the sentences stating that multiple studies found no effect of coffee on cancer mortality, including specific types of cancer, and detected no influence of coffee on the number of cancer deaths.",Current evidence suggests that coffee consumption in general is neither protective nor detrimental to cancer death risk.
Do diets with primarily or exclusively uncooked foods have health benefits?,"['Whether raw food followers suffer a heart attack or stroke less often, need less medication or live longer overall, can not be derived from this.', 'Conclusion A health benefit of raw food, which goes beyond an increased consumption of vegetable foods, has not been conclusively proven.', 'Rather, there are indications that strict raw food diets may also have a negative impact on health – similar to other diets that severely restrict food selection.']",1,"While raw food diets may increase vegetable consumption, there is no conclusive evidence for unique health benefits beyond this, and strict raw food diets could potentially have negative impacts on health similar to other restrictive diets.","In studies, we have not been able to find convincing evidence that raw foods provide health benefits over healthy diets that include cooked foods. On the contrary, there is also evidence of possible harm."
Can increased water consumption prevent migraines or other headaches?,"['Preventive effect of water unclear In 2011, Dutch researchers published a study [1] according to which drinking an additional one and a half liters of water per day could significantly relieve headaches.', 'Until strict clinical studies with a larger number of patients have been conducted, the effectiveness of increased water consumption cannot really be assessed.', 'However, if increased drinking can actually prevent headaches, the effect may not be particularly large.']",1,"While a study suggests that additional water consumption may alleviate headaches, the preventive effect remains unclear and larger clinical studies are needed to assess its effectiveness, indicating that the claim may be overstated.","Whether drinking more water can prevent headaches cannot be answered satisfactorily on the basis of studies conducted to date.

Are there health benefits to screening the general population for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as a precaution?,"['Recommendation against COPD screening The answer may surprise: such a precautionary examination does not bring any discernible health benefit.', ""If you don't have any symptoms yet and only learns about a COPD due to the screening, you may not have any benefit at all [1,2]."", 'Here, too, a population-wide COPD early detection does not bring any health benefit.']",2,"The claim is refuted by the sentences, as they indicate that general population screening for COPD does not provide any discernible health benefits, and learning about COPD through screening without symptoms may not bring any benefit.",Even people with moderately severe COPD may have little health benefit from starting treatment as early as possible. People without symptoms who are diagnosed with COPD only as a result of a screening test are therefore unlikely to gain much health benefit from drug treatment.
Can cow's milk cause iron deficiency in babies in the first year of life?,"[""Moreover, the infant can use iron from cow's milk much worse, because among other things the calcium and casein contained in it inhibits the absorption of iron."", ""Babies actually seem to suffer more from iron deficiency when they are fed cow's milk early on."", ""Only as far as iron deficiency is concerned, statements are possible: Seven out of eight studies suggest that early use of cow's milk in babies significantly increases the risk of iron deficiency.""]",0,"The claim is supported by the sentences, as they indicate that cow's milk contains inhibitors of iron absorption, and multiple studies suggest an increased risk of iron deficiency when cow's milk is introduced early in a baby's diet.","Cow's milk is low in usable iron. Therefore, cow's milk appears to increase the likelihood of iron deficiency in the blood of babies.

Does Imunoglukan strengthen the immune system?,"['So if there is any effect of imunoglucane at all, it is not clear whether the vitamin C or the ß-glucan from the fungus.', 'For imunoglucane no effect can currently be considered to have been demonstrated.', 'The study has no significance.']",1,"The claim that Imunoglukan strengthens the immune system is not supported, as stated in the sentences, with no demonstrated effect and uncertainty around its potential impact.","There are no studies that attest to Imunoglukan having a specific effect on a specific disease, nor any that confirm a general immune-boosting effect. The existing studies have glaring deficiencies."
Do cell phones promote the development and growth of tumors in the head?,"['But even after more than 20 years of mobile phone use and research, there are no clear answers.', 'Conclusion Despite in-depth research, the studies are not convincing.', 'Even if mobile phones increase the risk of cancer, the risk increase is minimal: in absolute terms, the risk increases from 0.0072 percent to 0.0096 percent.']",1,"While research has been conducted for over 20 years, the studies do not provide convincing evidence that cell phones promote the development and growth of tumors in the head, and even if there is a minor increase in risk, it is absolute terms it remains very small.","Despite intensive research, it is currently still unclear whether cell phones promote tumor diseases. According to current knowledge, the risk increases only minimally, if at all."
Does wearing bras promote breast cancer risk?,"['According to the summary and, above all, according to some pages on the Internet, the study shows that women who wear bras have a double risk of breast cancer than those who do not wear bras.', 'In sum, the study shows that wearing bras has no influence on the risk of breast cancer.', 'Therefore, a comparison of the risk of breast cancer between bra carriers and women who do not wear bra is not possible with this study.']",1,"The study's findings do not support a direct link between bra-wearing and breast cancer risk, as stated in some online sources, since the study also concludes that bra-wearing has no influence on breast cancer risk.","The extent to which wearing bras affects breast cancer risk is poorly understood. So far, results of case-control studies tend to argue against a risk from bras, and there is no serious evidence that bras increase the risk."
Are tattoo inks harmful to health?,"['Unknown danger Although it is known for many ingredients that they are carcinogenic or can cause allergies, there are virtually no studies on the long-term health consequences.', 'Where else the dyes in the body get, and whether they are an additional health risk, is also hardly researched.', 'A reliable test to check the allergy risk of tattoo inks is not yet available [2].', 'The studies in detail There are no meaningful studies on the safety of tattoo colours.']",1,"While there is knowledge about some ingredients in tattoo inks being carcinogenic or causing allergies, there is a lack of comprehensive studies on the long-term health consequences and allergy risks associated with tattoo inks, leaving the overall health impact uncertain.",Many tattoo inks contain substances that are harmful to health. Which colors can be used for tattoos without health concerns is unclear. There are no studies that investigate the risk.
Does the herbal hormone genistein reduce the number and intensity of hot flashes during menopause???,"['However: Genistein – which is a phytoestrogen from the group of isoflavones – may have a beneficial effect on the frequency of hot flashes at higher doses.', 'There was indeed a certain positive effect here: the frequency of hot flashes was reduced.']",0,"The claim is supported by the sentences, as genistein, a phytoestrogen, showed a positive effect in reducing the frequency of hot flashes at higher doses.","It is unclear whether phytoestrogens can help with hot flashes. Studies on this topic are often of modest quality; usually a comparison of the data is not possible. Therefore, an overall judgment cannot be made. One exception is the phytoestrogen genistein. There are indications that this plant substance in higher doses may be able to reduce the number of daily hot flashes a little."
Can FGXpress Power Strips reduce pain or improve wound healing?,"['The pointless claim of detoxification and detoxification is also made.', 'Many of the promises require studies: whether and in which cases pain can be reduced and which wounds can be better cured would have to be proven by a manufacturer in studies.', 'To our knowledge, however, there is not a single study on FGXPress Power Strips.', 'Although the manufacturer shows before/after images with a thermal camera, without accurate documentation and control by outsiders, this is completely worthless.']",1,"The claim that FGXPress Power Strips can reduce pain or improve wound healing is not supported by the provided sentences, as there is no evidence or study mentioned to back up these claims, and the manufacturer's before/after images lack accurate documentation and independent verification.",We could not find a single study on these patches - nor any reason to assume that they are effective.
Does treatment according to the fascial distortion model help with chronic shoulder pain?,"['In the study, this form of fascia therapy shows advantages over classic treatment: the mobility of the shoulder is improved more, as is functionality.', 'The most important criterion was how far the mobility of the shoulder can be improved: in the group treated according to fascia distortion model, mobility improved on average in patients by 30 percent in six weeks, in the comparison group only by 15 percent.', 'Participants in the FDM group also performed significantly and clinically relevantly better in terms of functionality and strength.']",0,"The study suggests that treatment according to the fascial distortion model results in greater improvement in shoulder mobility and functionality compared to classic treatment, as evidenced by a 30% improvement in mobility in the FDM group versus 15% in the comparison group, and better performance in terms of functionality and strength in the FDM group.","Currently, there is only one randomized controlled trial of this type of therapy. It suggests that fascia therapy may help with some shoulder conditions."
Are there effective alternatives to the breathing mask (CPAP) for sleep apnea?,"['The authors of an overview of 2013 see such interventions as a possible alternative for those patients who reject the breathing mask: During the day of fatigue they lead to a similar improvement as standard therapy, but they are not so good at reducing breath loss [2].', 'However, since the breath loss has a decisive influence on subsequent diseases, standard therapy is preferable if possible.', 'Overall, oxygen therapy is significantly less helpful than CPAP [3].', 'Conclusion For patients who reject standard therapy with breathing mask, there are numerous other treatment options available – but these are not as effective in the decisive symptoms as CPAP.']",2,"While some alternatives like daytime fatigue interventions can provide similar improvement in fatigue, they are not as effective in reducing breath loss, a crucial factor in preventing subsequent diseases, making CPAP the more effective standard therapy.","Although numerous other forms of treatment are available, some of them are too little researched or are clearly inferior to the standard therapy with CPAP."
Does closure of the foramen ovale prevent further strokes in people who have had a stroke of unknown cause?,"['If such patients have a PFO, surgical closure can be used to prevent further strokes.', 'Nevertheless, the data speak for the procedure; thus, even if the cause of the stroke is unknown, the risk of a further stroke can be reduced in at least those people who have an open foramen ovale.', 'All three individual studies provide very similar results and indicate that the closure avoids another stroke rather than just anticoagulant therapy with medications.']",0,"Closure of the foramen ovale can reduce the risk of further strokes in people who have had a stroke of unknown cause and have an open foramen ovale, as suggested by the individual studies indicating that closure avoids another stroke more effectively than anticoagulant therapy with medications.","According to three large studies, closure of the patent foramen ovale can prevent another stroke better than purely drug treatment can."
Does taking magnesium salts decrease the frequency and intensity of muscle cramps with unknown cause?,"['Insufficient evidence The examination shows that the evidence of efficacy is rather meager: We have not found any high-quality studies that have investigated the effect of magnesium salts on exertive muscle spasms, for example in athletes.', 'It is therefore unclear whether athletes benefit from the intake of magnesium supplements.']",2,"The claim that magnesium salts decrease the frequency and intensity of muscle cramps with unknown cause is not supported, as the examination of available evidence reveals a lack of high-quality studies investigating this effect in athletes, leaving it unclear whether athletes benefit from magnesium supplements.","No high-quality studies have been found on the efficacy of magnesium salts for exercise-induced muscle cramps, such as in athletes. For leg muscle cramps without an identifiable cause, researchers have been unable to demonstrate any effect of magnesium beyond placebo in studies. Pregnant women may benefit from magnesium supplements, but this evidence is not very robust."
Does the active ingredient rivaroxaban (drug Xarelto) have a higher risk of dangerous bleeding than other anticoagulants?,"['A summary analysis of studies published so far on rivaroxaban in particular also finds overall less fatal bleeding than in the use of vitamin K antagonists (cumarine) [4], although there has been no overall difference in the number of premature deaths.', 'The comparison of rivaroxaban with other factor Xa inhibitors shows only very small differences: According to a recent summary of several meta-analyses, the active substance of Xarelto does not perform best, but the result is uncertain.', 'Overall, these drugs have the same effect as the older vitamin K antagonist treatment, but with a significantly lower risk of bleeding – the risk is almost halved.', 'According to this, the new drugs avoid strokes more effectively than the older ones, with regard to the risk of bleeding there is no difference.']",2,"While rivaroxaban has been found to have a similar bleeding risk to other factor Xa inhibitors and a lower bleeding risk than vitamin K antagonists, there is no overall difference in the number of premature deaths compared to vitamin K antagonists, contradicting the claim of a higher dangerous bleeding risk.","High-quality studies in the most common uses of rivaroxaban show either an equal or even lower risk of bleeding than other blood-clotting medications. However, this does not mean it is the best choice in all cases. Research is still needed for bleeding in the stomach or intestines."
Does brain training boost intelligence?,"['Those who train their memory only get better in these exercises, i.e.', 'The training does not affect other mental tasks such as speech fluid or arithmetic.', 'With a total of only 75 participants it is not very extensive, but strengthens the results of the overview work: even here, a 20-unit training did not improve the general intelligence [2].', 'Another review of 2013 casts doubt on how much cognitive training can be helpful for children and adolescents with various mental developmental disorders [3].']",2,"The claim that brain training boosts intelligence is not supported, as the training does not affect other mental tasks and a study showed no improvement in general intelligence even after a 20-unit training.","There are many ways of brain training, but no evidence that it can improve intelligence. The most research in science is about a specific training of the ""working memory"", here the studies speak against a general improvement of intelligence."
Does petroleum help against cancer?,"['One of the legends of Petroleum says that the workers in oil fields do not have cancer.', 'The legend is not confirmed; large studies show that cancers in oil workers are as common as in other parts of the population [1] [2] [3], the risk of cancer is neither greater nor less for workers in the oil industry.', '[a] In Internet forums, kerosene is praised as a curative detox, but this can be thought of as ""detoxins"", we have already described here: https://www.medizin-transparent.at/mdzt4n5p4rnt/detox-of-mythos-vom-detoxins Studies in detail There are no studies on kerosene as a drug for cancer – for good reason, because a positive effect is far less likely than an additional health risk.']",1,"While anecdotal claims suggest a protective effect of petroleum against cancer, large studies indicate that cancer rates in oil workers are similar to the general population, and there is no scientific evidence or studies supporting the use of kerosene as a cancer treatment.","This rather absurd assumption has not been tested in studies. Since petroleum is more likely to pose a health hazard, such studies are also not conducted."
Does the drug Sovaldi (sofosbuvir) enable high cure rates for chronic hepatitis C?,"['Studies show that the new drug significantly increases treatment success: In patients who have not received treatment before, the chances of healing are now above 90 percent according to most studies [1] [2] [3] [a].', 'The active substance of Sovaldi (sofosbuvir) is very successful in most of these patient groups, although not all groups have the same evidence [1] [2].', 'In any case, Sovaldi and other agents that directly attack the virus have revolutionized the treatment of hepatitis C and studies are currently underway to test the different combinations of drugs in different patient groups.']",0,"The first sentence directly supports the claim by stating that Sovaldi significantly increases treatment success and has high cure rates in treatment-naive patients, with most studies showing above 90% healing chances.","Yes, in combination with drugs that have been available for some time, cure rates of over 90 percent are possible with sofosbuvir. However, there are many different patient groups, and success rates are not the same for all."
Are Vemma products good for health?,"['Quickly clarified There is no reason to believe that Vemma products have any health benefits; according to our research, they were only once the subject of a medical study – which, however, is completely unusable due to serious defects [1] Vemma, on the other hand, was often the subject of investigations, since the distribution system is very reminiscent of a pyramid game [b] [c].', 'However, the results are worthless for several reasons: there is no information on how the random assignment to the trial or placebo group happened, whether the blinding has kept, whether and how a blinding of the treating physicians has happened at all, the results contradict text and graphics and in the statistical analysis also serious errors have been made [1].']",1,"The claim that Vemma products are good for health is not supported, as the only medical study on them had serious defects and the distribution system resembles a pyramid scheme, according to the provided sentences.","We have found only one study that investigates health effects of Vemma. However, the study is so flawed that it does not allow us to draw any conclusions."
Do over-the-counter cough medicines relieve cough symptoms?,"['Thus, it is impossible to know whether freely available cough medications actually help, or only facilitate the purse.', 'The authors of the review analysed studies on a wide range of active substances: cough-saturating active substances: dextrometorphan, codeine (prescription) slime-solving agents: guaifenesin, bromhexin, ambroxol Various combinations of mucosa-swelling agents and antihistamines Overall, however, the studies analysed are of mostly doubtful quality and come to contradictory results.', 'Thus, for none of these active substances authorised in Austria there is evidence of effective relief of cough symptoms.', 'Even for the prescription codein, the study contribution in acute cough is unclear [1].']",1,"While various cough medications containing different active substances have been studied, the overall quality of these studies is questionable, leading to contradictory results, and specifically for over-the-counter options authorized in Austria, there is no evidence of effective relief of cough symptoms.",That over-the-counter cough medicines provide relief from acute cough is neither proven nor disproven - there are simply no studies of sufficient quality to answer this question.
Does a diet rich in vitamin K2 protect against diseases of the cardiovascular system?,"['However, a vitamin-K-rich diet has no (favorable) influence on the occurrence of a stroke – also a cardiovascular disease, as reported in 2013.', 'Vitamin K2-rich diet, however, has a positive effect on overall mortality and the risk of cancer.', 'All in all, these data do not allow conclusions to be drawn about the general population or the optimal dose of the supposedly positive vitamin K2.']",1,"While a vitamin K2-rich diet may have a positive effect on overall mortality and cancer risk, it does not seem to influence the occurrence of strokes, which is a cardiovascular disease, making it difficult to support the claim that it protects against diseases of the cardiovascular system.","While there are some studies that suggest a possible link between vitamin K2-rich diets and higher vascular health.

Does bioresonance therapy help with health complaints?,"['In this regard, the Commission refers primarily to physical opinions which allegedly show that the basic principles of bioresonance are incorrect [1], but also mentions three clinical studies which have shown ineffectiveness.', 'What to Know About Bioresonance There are no meaningful studies that certify efficacy of bioresonance, while two small clinical studies clearly speak against [7] [9].', 'The studies in detail The three studies already mentioned in the position name clearly show, on the one hand, that the method is not suitable for diagnosing allergies [8], on the other hand, they are only partly meaningful as a verification of efficacy – simply due to the low number of participants [7] [9].', 'Since 2006, some studies have been published, which allegedly speak for bioresonance, but most of them are scientifically worthless.']",2,"The claim that bioresonance therapy helps with health complaints is refuted by the Commission's reference to physical opinions contradicting the basic principles of bioresonance and three clinical studies showing its ineffectiveness, as well as the lack of meaningful studies supporting its efficacy and the questionable scientific value of studies claiming to support it.","Good studies on the question are hard to find. Due to the lack of proof of efficacy, the risk of misdiagnosis and the lack of plausibility, professional associations have been warning against bioresonance for some time."
Do irradiations with cold red light help with chronic gingivitis?,"['Few studies, no effect The few studies published so far indicate, however, that cold red light cannot effectively relieve such inflammations [1] [2] [3].', 'The fact that cold red light is intended to reduce pain after dental surgery can also not prove previous research results [4].', 'In none of these, the participating researchers were able to find an additional benefit of cold red light irradiation for the usual periodontitis treatment.', 'The summary analysis of existing studies does not indicate that cold red light can alleviate the consequences of dental surgery.']",2,"The claim that cold red light helps with chronic gingivitis is refuted by the studies mentioned, which found no additional benefit of cold red light irradiation for usual periodontitis treatment or alleviation of dental surgery consequences.",Previous studies indicate that chronic gingivitis and inflammation after dental surgery do not improve with irradiation with cold red light.
Can FLEXISEQ ointment relieve osteoarthritis pain?,"[""So the ointment FLEXISEQ would have to be compared to a placebo ointment – that hasn't happened yet; compared to a medication to be swallowed, a placebo to be swallowed, and an ointment with an active substance, but its effectiveness itself is not too clear."", 'So it is not sure whether the ointment helps better than a suitable placebo.', 'The study duration in the four individual studies described is a maximum of 12 weeks, so long-term effects have not yet been investigated.']",1,"While there is no comparison to a placebo ointment or investigation into long-term effects, the direct comparison to other treatments is unclear, making it uncertain whether FLEXISEQ ointment alleviates osteoarthritis pain better than a suitable placebo.",Comparisons to date with other commonly used treatments are difficult to interpret but do not yield clear evidence of efficacy.
Can butterbur prevent migraine attacks?,"['In summary, both studies show that it is twice as likely that the number of migraine attacks will halve after twelve weeks with the Pestwurz preparation compared to a dummy medication.', 'The above overviews are of different quality, but all come to the same conclusions due to the two same studies: Pestwurz can reduce the number of migraine attacks for some patients.']",0,"Both studies summarized indicate that butterbur, referred to as Pestwurz, has shown a higher likelihood of reducing the frequency of migraine attacks compared to a placebo, supporting the claim.","Two well-done randomized-controlled trials show efficacy - the number of migraine attacks can probably be reduced with butterbur.

Can topiramate reduce the frequency of migraine attacks?,"['The authors summarized the results of 17 studies and found that the number of headaches actually decreases – but only by one in 28 days.', '[1] The overview also shows positive effects on the overall quality of life, but only to a small extent and not quite without contradiction.', 'Although all studies go in the same direction and indicate the effectiveness of topiramate, despite the review work of Cochrane Collaboration, the evidence is low, also because there are other criticisms: The authors have several conflicts of interest and it is possible that studies with poor results have not been published (publication bias).', 'Little knowledge about chronic migraine In the expert recommendation on therapy and care for chronic migraine, two small studies are mentioned, according to which topiramate can also prevent in chronic migraine attacks [2].']",0,"The claim is weakly supported as one study shows a minor decrease in headache frequency, and two small studies suggest effectiveness in chronic migraine, but overall evidence is low due to potential conflicts of interest and publication bias.","Possibly yes. A review by the Cochrane Collaboration attests that topiramate slightly reduces the frequency of migraine attacks in adults, and in some patients the attacks even decrease significantly. Still, there are unanswered questions and the side effects should not be underestimated."
Does particulate matter pollution increase the risk of heart attack - even if the EU limits are complied with?,"['The study of over 367,000 adults from 13 European countries indicates that long-term exposure to particulate matter generally increases the risk of mortality – meaning life-saving [1].', ""The authors reported that long-term exposure to particulate matter at the place of residence makes the occurrence of heart attack and unstable angina pectoris ('heart', a sign of an imminent heart attack) more likely."", 'An English cohort study from 2013 could not deduce a link between heart attack risk and fine dust air pollution, but fine dust exposure increased the risks of other heart diseases.', 'The short-term inhalation of larger amounts of fine dust may also make a heart attack more likely.']",0,"Long-term exposure to particulate matter can increase the risk of heart attack and unstable angina pectoris, supporting the claim that such pollution may still pose risks within EU limits, as the claim does not specify the level or duration of exposure.","Recent studies from Europe indicate that everyday exposure to particulate matter may increase the risk of acute heart disease (myocardial infarction, angina pectoris). General mortality may also be increased already by 'allowed' long-term exposure within the current EU limits."
Are endocrine disruptors in cosmetics a health risk?,"['Thus, the risk for parabens is not demonstrated by clinical studies, especially not by cosmetics.', 'Many chemicals are not researched at all, the interaction with certain diseases is unknown and it is also not sufficiently clear when and how endocrine disruptors intervene in the physical development of adolescents [b].', 'Humans are therefore exposed to many such influences, which makes risk assessment very difficult.']",1,"While there is no demonstrated risk for parabens in cosmetics, many endocrine disruptors remain under-researched, making it unclear how they interact with certain diseases and affect adolescent development, which complicates risk assessment.","Although many cosmetics do indeed contain substances that can influence the hormone system, a health risk has not been proven.

Does treatment with radioactive agents help with pain in chronic inflammatory joint disease?,"['If the correct amount of a suitable radioactive substance is injected directly into the joint, the radiation causes the swollen and inflamed joint mucosa to die – after healing, a healthy skin can grow back, the inflammation is gone [1].', 'According to a 2009 overview study, success rates in small joints vary from 54 to 100 percent pain reduction 12 months after treatment, from 29 to 94 percent pain reduction in large joints [1].', 'A somewhat recent randomized-controlled study compared two drugs for radiosynoviorthesis and cortisone: after 48 weeks, the frequently used yttrium performed better than cortisone and the comparator, but only in a single point – namely on a particular pain scale.']",0,"The first sentence supports the claim by describing how radioactive substances can reduce inflammation in joints, while the second sentence provides success rates for pain reduction in small and large joints after treatment. The third sentence, although specific to a study comparing two drugs for radiosynoviorthesis, also supports the claim by showing better performance of yttrium (a radioactive substance) over cortisone in pain reduction.","Depending on the cause of the pain, radiosynoviorthesis can lead to considerable pain reduction, as confirmed by a 2009 review. However, it is not proven whether the treatment is more effective than cortisone treatment."
Does frequent porn use reduce gray matter volume in the brain?,"['[1] Cause and effect The study shows a correlation between frequent consumption of porn and the size of a brain region, but cannot provide any information as to whether the size of the gray brain mass changes due to consumption of porn.', 'No damage detectable In 2011, three Californian researchers pointed out that there was no evidence of brain damage due to porn consumption.', 'All studies that went in this direction have the same problem as the current study: It is not clear what is the cause and what is the effect – there is no study that actually investigates the long-term effects of porn consumption on the brain.']",1,"The claim is not sufficiently supported by the provided sentences, as there is no study that directly investigates the long-term effects of frequent porn use on gray matter volume in the brain.",The study is not powered to examine the long-term effects of pornography on the brain and other studies on this were not found.
"Does treatment with cyanoacrylate (for example, Sapheon Venaseal™) help against varicose veins as well or better than other methods?","['There are other scientific studies to close varicose veins with cyanoacrylate, but these do not meet current scientific requirements.', 'However, the efficacy cannot be assessed precisely, since the study authors had not compared their method to another treatment or sham treatment.', 'How good the method is compared to other methods has not been adequately studied [7].']",1,"The claim cannot be accurately assessed as there are studies using cyanoacrylate for varicose veins, but they do not meet current scientific standards, lack direct comparisons to other treatments, and have not been thoroughly studied in relation to other methods.","To date, there are no results from clinical studies on this method. The efficacy in comparison with other treatments is therefore unclear."
"Did oseltamivir (Tamiflu®) or other neuraminidase inhibitors help reduce deaths from the H1N1 influenza virus (""swine flu"" virus)?","['It is striking that the raw data do not show a significant difference in the death rate between neuraminidase inhibitors and untreated patients.', 'Tamiflu alone did not investigate whether the Tamiflu active substance oseltamivir saved lives during the H1N1 pandemic was not investigated separately in the study funded by the Tamiflu manufacturer.']",1,"The claim that neuraminidase inhibitors, including oseltamivir (Tamiflu®), helped reduce deaths from the H1N1 influenza virus is not directly supported by the provided sentences, which mention a lack of significant difference in death rate between treated and untreated patients, and the absence of a separate investigation into Tamiflu's impact on saving lives during the pandemic.","Previously published analyses of data from the H1N1 influenza (""swine flu"") pandemic period are of insufficient quality to answer this question."
Is aluminum intake responsible for the development of Alzheimer's disease?,"['Cause unknown As far as the cause of pathological memory loss is concerned, research is still relatively in the dark.', ""However, due to the implementation of the study, it cannot be concluded that small traces of aluminium are actually the triggering cause of Alzheimer's disease.""]",1,"The claim cannot be definitively supported or refuted based on these sentences, as they indicate that the cause of Alzheimer's disease remains largely unknown and the study does not conclusively link small traces of aluminum to the disease.","Scientific studies cannot prove with certainty a connection between the metal aluminum and the disease Alzheimer, but they cannot exclude it either."
Can regular exercise prevent or relieve migraine symptoms?,"['In a systematic overview from 2008 [ 2 ] of 7 studies with very low participation numbers, the authors conclude that sporting activity can probably lead to a slight reduction in the pain intensity of further migraine attacks.', 'A randomized-controlled study [ 3 ] in 30 migraine patients found at least a small reduction in the pain intensity of future migraine seizures for a combination program of aerobic training followed by muscle relaxation.', 'In another, less rigorous study [ 4 ] in 16 patients, compared to migraine patients who did not participate in any sports program, there was also a small reduction in pain intensity.', 'In a recent study from 2009 [ 5 ], the scientists found a similar improvement in the frequency of monthly migraine attacks.', 'Too little comprehensive investigations for clear effect In summary, a certain effectiveness of regularly operated endurance sports such as jogging or cycling for prevention of migraine attacks seems likely.']",0,"While some studies suggest a small reduction in pain intensity or frequency of migraine attacks with regular exercise, the number of participants in these studies is low and more comprehensive investigations are needed to establish a clear effect.","In some, but not all, studies, regular exercise seems to at least somewhat reduce the pain intensity of future migraine attacks. Whether the frequency of migraine attacks can also be reduced cannot be assessed with certainty. for this, larger, better validated studies would have to be conducted."
Does less than 7h of sleep daily increase mental performance?,"['Already six hours of sleep reduce brain performance The results of a small randomized-controlled study [1] clearly contradict the claim of performance-enhancing sleep loss.', 'After only a few nights it became apparent: the shorter the participants could sleep at night, the worse they did in the tests compared to the group with eight hours of sleep.', 'The performance of the sleep deficit group was significantly worse after five days compared to the control group, although the impact is limited by the small size of the control group.', 'This shows that lack of sleep actually seemed to be the cause of the worse mental performance.', 'Overall, if you sleep only six or less hours per night, you will hardly be wiser, but it seems to impair your mental performance.']",2,"The sentences provide evidence that less than 7h of sleep daily decreases mental performance, contradicting the claim.",Two small randomized-controlled studies indicate that mental performance decreases with the number of sleepless hours per night and the number of nights with insufficient sleep. No single scientific study provides evidence of an increase in mental performance due to shorter sleep duration.
Does regular intake of extra virgin olive oil protect against coronary heart disease such as heart attack?,"['Probably related to reduced risk of heart attack Many research groups have already studied the question of whether olive oil can actually reduce the risk of heart attacks and other heart diseases over the last two decades.', 'When eating more than 30 grams of olive oil per day, the risk of heart disease was only about half as high as in people who consumed less than 15 grams per day or no olive oil at all.', 'The olive oil-rich diet resulted in a significant reduction in the risk of heart attack and death for almost five years by just under a third compared to a conventional diet.', 'Study participants with high olive oil consumption were significantly less likely to be found in the group of heart attack patients, the scientists therefore concluded that the oil had a significant protective effect.', 'The results of the two most reliable and largest cohort studies [ 2, 3 ] indicate a likely protective effect of increased consumption of cold-pressed olive oil over several years.']",0,"Regular intake of extra virgin olive oil is likely associated with a reduced risk of coronary heart disease, such as heart attack, as indicated by several studies showing lower heart disease rates and a significant protective effect in high olive oil consumers.","Regular consumption of cold-pressed olive oil may possibly prevent coronary heart disease. However, direct evidence is still pending."
Do frequent ejaculations have a protective effect against prostate cancer?,"['Result: Men with frequent ejaculations between 20 and 30 years of age have a one-third reduced prostate cancer risk compared to those with rare ejaculations [1].', ""Taking the result seriously, it doesn't show that much self-satisfaction protects, but rather that men with very few ejaculations could have a slightly higher risk of prostate cancer."", 'Here it turns out that frequent ejaculations from the age of four years onwards or over the entire life span may reduce the risk of prostate cancer [3].', 'In sum, the study provides evidence that with increasing ejaculation frequency, the risk of prostate cancer could actually decrease.']",0,"The claim is supported by the sentences, as they suggest a correlation between frequent ejaculations and reduced prostate cancer risk, starting from age four and potentially throughout life.","A cohort study suggests that more frequent ejaculations starting at age 40, or over a lifetime, could potentially lower the risk of prostate cancer. This is not exclusive to ejaculations from masturbation, but from any sexual activity."
Do today's children have a shorter life expectancy than their parents?,"['Overweight leads to a higher rate of premature deaths – which reduces life expectancy on average by 3 to 9 months.', 'So it would be a reversal of the trend: for the first time in a long time, children would have a life expectancy less than their parents.', 'There are some reasons to assume that it will be worse than the 3 to 9 months less: Obesity is becoming more common and occurs in increasingly younger children [1].', 'If this trend continues, there may be a reduction in life expectancy of three to five years.']",0,"The claim is not directly supported by the sentences, as they discuss a potential reduction in life expectancy due to obesity, but do not provide concrete evidence that today's children already have a shorter life expectancy than their parents.","Obesity and physical inactivity are increasing risk factors worldwide that can shorten life. In 2005, a study from the USA concluded that life expectancy could be reduced by 3 to 9 months when these risks were included."
Do rising temperatures and CO2 levels increase the risk of pollen allergy?,"['It is unclear whether the increase in CO2 has already caused a noticeable increase in the amount of pollen released.', 'Influence on allergy risk unclear However, whether the increasing pollen exposure also increases the risk of developing pollen allergy for non-allergic agents is unclear.', 'Whether higher levels of pollen increase the probability of hay fever is so far unclear [5].', 'There is nothing to read about pollen becoming more aggressive in so far published studies.']",1,"While there is evidence of increased pollen exposure due to rising temperatures and CO2 levels, it remains unclear whether this leads to a higher risk of developing pollen allergy, according to the provided sentences.","Rising temperatures and increased CO2 concentrations cause plants to produce larger amounts of pollen over a longer period of time. However, it is unclear whether larger amounts of pollen and a longer pollen season increase the likelihood of developing pollen allergy."
Does training on vibration platforms cause a noticeable buildup of muscle strength?,"['Therefore, training on vibration platforms could actually strengthen the muscle strength of the leg muscles.', 'However, compared to conventional strengthening training, the results do not indicate superiority of vibration platforms.', 'According to the results of this study, it could be concluded at most that training on a vibration platform in combination with a diet can lead to weight loss, which could also be achieved by a conventional fitness program or a mere diet without exercise program.']",0,"While training on vibration platforms may strengthen leg muscles to some extent, it does not show superiority over conventional strengthening training and can only contribute to weight loss when combined with a diet, which can also be achieved through conventional fitness programs or diets without exercise.","Vibration training may be helpful for building muscle strength in the legs, but it is not better than conventional training for this purpose. Whether the method is also suitable for weight reduction has not been sufficiently studied."
Does glucosamine prolong life?,"['This is exactly what happens once again in the article on glucosamine as a life prolonger: The study was conducted on nematodes (fade worms) and mice and in which glucosamine led to an extended life span [1].', 'The conclusion of the researchers: If glucosamine has the same effect in two different species and these processes are also conceivable in humans, then glucosamine is highly likely to prolong life expectancy in humans.', 'Yes, with many limitations There is a cohort study on humans on this question: In 2010, a first evaluation looked at the influence of 20 vitamins or dietary supplements on life expectancy [3]; of these 20 only glucosamine and chondroitin showed a possible relationship with life expectancy.', 'The researchers speculate that glucosamine prolongs life expectancy just as was found in aspirin [2].', 'Until then, the life-prolonging effect of glucosamine remains optimistic speculation with little evidence.']",0,"While some studies suggest a possible relationship between glucosamine and extended lifespan in nematodes, mice, and humans, the evidence is limited, and the life-prolonging effect in humans remains speculative.","Although research here is still in its infancy and there is only one cohort study in humans besides basic studies, this shows possible effects. Further studies with better methods and other groups of participants are necessary."
Does Kinesio tape help in the treatment of joint and muscle injuries?,"['Therefore, it cannot be said whether the tape could contribute to the improvement of the pain after a long period of time.', 'Overall, the efficacy of Kinesio tape in musculoskeletal pain and injuries is at best unclear.', 'Since no studies have been carried out for more than 6 days, however, nothing can be said about a possible longer-term effect of the tape.']",1,"While some studies on Kinesio tape's effectiveness in musculoskeletal pain and injuries have been conducted, their duration was limited to 6 days or less, leaving uncertainty about any potential long-term effects, which aligns with the claim of unclear efficacy.",There is no evidence that kinesio tape can reduce pain within a few days. It is unclear whether taping can help improve movement restrictions caused by an injury.
Do injections with Botulinum Toxin A (Botox®) help with urinary incontinence?,"['According to the standard, Botulinum Toxin A (known as Botox®) has been approved in Ireland and possibly other European countries for the treatment of incontinence caused by multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injuries.', 'Efficacy of Botulinum Toxin A A summary of the results of 19 randomised-controlled studies, each with a relatively small number of participants, shows good efficacy [1].', ""Therefore, a single series of injections with Botulinum Toxin A in the bladder's detrusor muscle can significantly reduce the frequency of urinary loss in patients with incontinence.""]",0,"The claim is supported by the sentences as Botulinum Toxin A (Botox®) has been approved in Ireland and possibly other European countries for treating incontinence caused by multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injuries, and multiple studies show its good efficacy in reducing the frequency of urinary loss.","Several small randomized-controlled trials show that injections of botulinum toxin A into the detrusor muscle surrounding the urinary bladder can reduce, but not completely prevent, the incidence of involuntary urinary leakage."
Can apigenin reduce cancer risk or prevent cancer progression?,"['On the other hand, a laboratory study [5] found that apigenin might inhibit the effect of chemotherapy treatments.', 'However, when treated with apigenin, the cancer cells became resistant to this drug and did not die.', 'Apigenine without influence on cancer risk What applies in small cases could also apply in large cases.', 'This showed that those participants who had eaten the most apigenine with food were not less likely to have cancer than other women in the study.', 'Unefficacious and possibly risky Apart from laboratory findings, previous observational studies show that the potential protective effect of apigenin is not able to significantly reduce the risk of cancer in normal diets [8].']",2,"While some laboratory studies suggest apigenin might inhibit chemotherapy effects and cause resistance in cancer cells, observational studies show no significant reduction in cancer risk with normal dietary intake.","Studies suggest that even high levels of apigenin in food do not protect against cancer.

Are animal-assisted therapies effective for mental illness?,"['The authors conclude from the data that animal assisted therapies may be effective in some diseases, including mental disorders and behavioural disorders such as depression, schizophrenia and addiction.', 'There is still no reliable data on the efficacy of animal-based therapy, for example in patients with cancer and advanced fatal diseases, in terms of state of health and quality of life.']",0,"While the first sentence supports the claim that animal-assisted therapies may be effective for mental and behavioral disorders like depression, schizophrenia, and addiction, the second sentence indicates a lack of reliable data for their efficacy in patients with cancer and advanced fatal diseases, leaving the claim's applicability to these conditions uncertain.","Studies on the effects of animal-assisted therapies are only partially conclusive. It seems plausible that animal-assisted therapies can be supportive for some mental illnesses; however, very large or rapid effects are unlikely."
Can lack of sleep cause obesity?,"['So, most likely, lack of sleep is just one of many different factors that can affect weight gain.', 'Cause unclear The mere fact that people with a lack of sleep are more likely to be overweight or gain more weight than those who sleep, however, does not necessarily mean that the lack of sleep is the real cause of obesity.', 'People who sleep too little usually have an unhealthy lifestyle in general, so other factors can also play a role in increasing weight gain.', ""Whether lack of sleep actually makes you fat can't be said from previous study results – even if there is evidence that people who sleep little may become overweight rather than people with normal sleep.""]",1,"While there is a correlation between lack of sleep and obesity, the sentences suggest that it may be part of a larger unhealthy lifestyle pattern, and the causality between sleep deprivation and weight gain is not definitively established by previous studies.",People who regularly get too little sleep may be more likely to be overweight than those who get enough sleep. But whether lack of sleep itself causes obesity is unclear.
Is breaking an energy-saving lamp harmful to health?,"['[3] If an energy-saving lamp breaks, the mercury contained therein escapes, among other things, in the form of mercury vapour.', 'However, these experiments did not directly investigate whether this could lead to signs of poisoning in humans.', 'Even if the safety limit has been exceeded in some cases, mercury vapour concentrations in the ambient air did not reach levels for which a health hazard is considered probable in any study.']",1,"While breaking an energy-saving lamp releases mercury vapor, currently available studies do not indicate that this leads to probable health hazards in humans, as mercury vapor concentrations in the ambient air did not reach levels considered harmful.","If an energy-saving lamp breaks, mercury vapor is released in quantities that can exceed the limits considered safe. Whether this can cause damage to health has not been directly investigated. However, after removal of the broken glass and good ventilation of the room, the value quickly falls back below the limit value."
Do air ions cause an improvement of allergies?,['Hardly any studies on anti-allergic effects No clinical studies have been performed to date on the alleged anti-allergic effects of air ions.'],1,"The claim that air ions cause an improvement of allergies is not supported by any clinical studies, as stated in the sentences provided.","Whether ionized air can reduce allergic symptoms is unclear, as no studies exist on this question.

Do air ions cause an improvement of asthma??,"['Compared to asthma patients who were exposed to dummy treatment, actual therapy with air ionization devices did not show any improvement in asthma symptoms or lung function.']",2,"The claim that air ions cause an improvement of asthma is not supported by the provided sentences, as a study found no difference in asthma symptoms or lung function between patients exposed to air ionization devices and those who received a dummy treatment.","Whether ionized air can reduce allergic symptoms is unclear, as no studies exist on this question. Air ionization devices do not appear to be effective against asthma in general."
Do smoking bans lead to fewer preterm births?,"['Smoking bans mean that mothers smoke less in pregnancy and that unborn women are exposed to less passive smoke.', 'It is a methodically very good work, but there are some limitations to the statements: the results of the individual studies vary greatly, whether the real effect is really 10% each, will only be able to clarify future studies.']",0,"The claim is supported to some extent by the first sentence, indicating that smoking bans could lead to fewer preterm births due to reduced smoking and passive smoke exposure for pregnant mothers, but the second sentence suggests variability in the results of individual studies, leaving room for future clarification.","A large review shows a 10% reduced risk of preterm birth. Due to some limitations, the evidence is nevertheless low, further studies from different countries will probably soon bring clarity."
Does caffeine make us die sooner???,"['However, this does not yet clarify whether caffeine shortens or prolongs life.', 'This does not mean that it is caffeine that reduces the risk of mortality; it only shows that people who drink a lot of coffee differ in their risk from people who drink little coffee.', 'Why this is so and what role caffeine itself plays is not clarified – even if it could be shown by which mechanisms caffeine may have its positive effect [c].']",1,"The claim that caffeine makes us die sooner is not directly supported or refuted by these sentences, as they discuss the association between coffee consumption and mortality risk, but do not clarify the specific role of caffeine in this relationship.","In moderate amounts, alcohol could reduce the likelihood of dying prematurely. In higher doses, however, it clearly increases this risk. This is unclear for caffeine."
Does acupuncture help against hay fever?,"['As with other acupuncture studies, it is therefore questionable whether the improvement of hay fever symptoms was due to the needle stitches themselves.', 'In order to distinguish between the placebo effect and the specific effect of acupuncture in the future, further studies with better study designs are necessary.']",1,"The improvement of hay fever symptoms may not be directly attributable to acupuncture itself, as other factors such as placebo effect could also be involved, requiring further studies with improved designs to distinguish between the two.",We have not found any meaningful studies that can provide evidence of improvement in hay fever.
Do earrings cause discomfort by destroying acupuncture points or meridians?,"['However, we could not find any studies that would have investigated earrings and their effects on meridians or acupuncture points.']",1,"The claim cannot be supported or refuted with the given sentences, as there is no available scientific research investigating the relationship between earrings and acupuncture points or meridians.","Earrings very often lead to complications, fortunately most of them are harmless. However, whether earrings can also destroy meridians or similar representation points of body regions in the auricle and thus lead to health complaints has not been investigated in studies."

Can phthalates cause diabetes?,"['The authors of two recently published studies found significantly higher concentrations of phthalates in the body in diabetic patients than in those without diabetes [1] [2].', 'No direct evidence for diabetes cause, but indications Even if there are increased concentrations of various phthalates in the body in diabetics as well as in people with a diabetes precursor – this is not proof that phthalates trigger diabetes.']",0,"While higher concentrations of phthalates have been observed in diabetic patients, there is no direct evidence presented in these studies to conclude that phthalates cause diabetes.","Studies conducted in humans to date show that people with diabetes or pre-diabetes have significantly elevated phthalate concentrations in their bodies. Although these studies cannot prove that diabetes is caused or contributed to by phthalates, results from laboratory studies in the test tube and in animals point in this direction. However, studies over longer periods of time are needed to confirm this."
Can taking the enzyme diamino oxidase prevent alcohol-related hangover symptoms?,"['Two of the capsules containing the active substance diamino-oxidase (DAO) – taken before drinking alcohol – should not even cause or at least partially prevent hangover symptoms the next morning – one learns something disillusioned at the end of the courier article by a university professor.', ""Therefore, the manufacturer's claim that its DAO-contained product can reduce or even prevent the unpleasant consequences of excessive consumption of alcohol is not scientifically substantiated.""]",1,"The first sentence does not provide sufficient evidence to support the claim as it only refers to one instance of using the product, and the second sentence directly refutes the claim by stating there is no scientific evidence to support the manufacturer's claim.","Such an effect is not likely, nor do clinical studies exist on this issue."
Can an anti-oxidant such as pseudocatalase stop or reverse hair graying?,['Whether pseudocatalase can return its colour to gray hair due to age (which only appear grey but are actually white) has not been investigated.'],1,"The claim that an antioxidant like pseudocatalase can stop or reverse hair graying due to age is not directly supported by the provided sentence, as it states that the potential of pseudocatalase to restore color to gray hair has not been investigated.",This question has not yet been scientifically investigated and therefore cannot be answered.
Can sexual activity relieve headaches?,"['Instead of the 60 colported, only 44 out of 100 migraine patients – less than half – actually noticed at least sometimes a relief of their pain.', 'In some one third of respondents, sexual activities occasionally resulted in improvement, but in half of them a worsening of the symptoms.']",1,"The claim that sexual activity relieves headaches is not fully supported by the given sentences, as only 44 out of 100 migraine patients experienced relief at least sometimes, and for some, sexual activity even led to a worsening of symptoms.","Individuals report subjective improvement. However, reliable scientific evidence that sexual activity in general can relieve migraine and cluster headaches is insufficient."
Does transcranial direct current stimulation help against severe depression?,"['tDCS therefore shows little success in the treatment of severe depression.', 'While the effect of tDCS is unclear, a number of active substances and psychotherapeutic procedures have been shown to be effective in the treatment of severe depression.']",1,"The first sentence directly refutes the claim by stating that tDCS shows little success in treating severe depression, while the second sentence does not provide clear evidence for or against the claim.","A brand new review shows that tDCS does not lead to lasting improvement in patients with major depression, nor is the response to therapy better than to placebo treatment. However, the number of participants, both overall and in the individual studies, is too low for a reliable assessment."
Does regular use of sleeping pills promote the risk of death or cancer?,"['According to an article in the Kronen newspaper, such sleeping pills are said to be responsible for many deaths.', 'Although the risk of developing cancer was much less increased, the study showed a clear correlation between the intake of more than 130 tablets per year and the risk of developing cancer.', 'The authors of the study suspect that sleeping drugs, for example due to the drowsiness they sometimes cause, can lead to more dangerous falls or fatal accidents.', 'Also a connection with a higher rate of depression among people taking sleeping pills and thus a higher proportion of suicides as a result of depression is not excluded.', 'Although the authors of the study [ 1 ] have ruled out many other diseases as a probable reason for the significantly increased risk of death and cancer, an absolutely safe proof that sleeping agents are the cause of this, they still cannot provide their findings.']",0,"The claim is not definitively supported by the sentences, as the study mentioned does not provide absolute proof that regular use of sleeping pills promotes the risk of death or cancer, but only correlations and suspicions.","There is a connection between the use of sleeping pills and an increased risk of death or cancer. However, it cannot be ruled out with certainty that other reasons are not responsible for this increased risk."
Can exercise improve mental performance impaired by alcohol consumption?,"['Because if these parameters are included in the calculations, the difference between the athletes and the non-sportsmen disappears.']",1,"The sentence suggests that when certain factors are considered, there is no distinction in mental performance between athletes and non-athletes, implying that exercise may not necessarily improve mental performance impaired by alcohol consumption.","There are only two studies that deal with this issue. Only one examines the problem in humans, and that is only a small pilot study. Whether sport reduces alcohol-related brain damage has not been clarified."
Can over-the-counter combination medications help with tension headache and migraine better than medications containing only single active ingredients?,"['In addition to the good suitability of ASA, Diclofenac and Ibuprofen alone, the effectiveness of the combination of acetylsalycilic acid (ASS), paracetamol and caffeine is highlighted.', 'According to a study in migraine, this combination of three was better than ibuprofen alone.', 'Combination preparations with caffeine therefore have a slightly better effect than those without caffeine.', 'Therefore, the question of which active substances or combination is the most effective cannot be answered.', 'Proportionally well-proven is that caffeine as an addition to common painkillers can increase its effect slightly.']",0,"While some studies suggest that certain combinations, like ASS, paracetamol, and caffeine, or common painkillers with caffeine, may have a slightly better effect than single active ingredients or caffeine-free combinations, there is no definitive answer on which combination is the most effective.","The addition of caffeine may slightly increase the effect of common painkillers in some people. The combination of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), paracetamol and caffeine is possibly the most effective. However, no better tolerability of the combination preparations was found.

"For women at high risk of breast cancer, does a precautionary mastectomy make more sense than regular participation in intensive screening?","['A direct comparison of the methods ""Screening"" and ""Precautionary breast removal"" is not possible on the basis of the current study situation: randomized-controlled studies are unthinkable, because even if the treatments to be compared are similarly effective, a random attribution to a treatment form would of course be unethical.']",1,"The claim cannot be supported or refuted with the current study situation, as randomized-controlled studies comparing screening and precautionary breast removal are unthinkable due to ethical considerations.","High-risk patients can significantly reduce their risk of breast cancer with preventive breast screening. Nevertheless, no general recommendation can be derived from this, as intensive screening programs are an alternative. However, good long-term studies are still lacking for both preventive measures, and the decision can only be made on a very individual basis."
Does tocilizumab specifically help children with rheumatoid arthritis (juvenile idiopathic arthritis) ?,"[""Although the data from the two children's studies are not as reliable as those from the larger and more numerous studies in adults, tocilizumab may be more effective in children with systemic JIA than in adults with rheumatic arthritis.""]",0,"The sentences suggest that tocilizumab may be more effective in children with a specific type of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (systemic JIA) than in adults with rheumatic arthritis, partially supporting the claim.","In contrast to adult rheumatoid arthritis patients, where the efficacy of tocilizumab has been well studied, there are only 2 controlled studies for use in children on a specific subtype (systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis) with very few participants. These suggest better efficacy than in adults, but in reality this is likely to be lower than presented in the study results. In addition, the drug can also cause severe side effects."
Is Exemestane better than other hormone-altering drugs for reducing the risk of breast cancer or treating it?,"['Therefore, it cannot be answered whether exemestan works better for the treatment of breast cancer than other aromatase inhibitors other than anastrozole.', 'There are still too few data to compare different aromatase inhibitors with respect to their side effects.']",0,"The claim cannot be definitively answered with the provided information, as there is no data comparing exemestane to aromatase inhibitors other than anastrozole, and there is insufficient data to compare side effects among different aromatase inhibitors.","The group of so-called aromatase inhibitors, which includes Exemestane, causes a higher survival rate in the treatment of breast cancer patients than other hormone-influencing drugs. Exemestane probably does not work any better than the aromatase inhibitor anastrozole. Whether Exemestane works better compared to other aromatase inhibitors is still unclear."
Does a newly approved contraceptive pill with the active ingredient combination nomegestrol acetate and 17ß-estradiol have fewer undesirable side effects than other birth control pills?,"['Conclusion Although the benefits of the new pill are mentioned only cautiously in both newspaper articles, there are no scientific facts that indicate fewer side effects, lower exposure to the liver or a reduced risk of thrombosis.', 'Also, the fact that the use of natural estradiol as estrogen hormone instead of usual ethinyl estradiol has significant advantages cannot be proven from the study data.']",2,"The claim of fewer undesirable side effects in the new pill cannot be substantiated by the study data, as neither a reduction in liver exposure, thrombosis risk, nor the advantages of natural estradiol over ethinyl estradiol are indicated in the articles.","Compared to two other birth control pills available in pharmacies, side effects such as acne, weight gain or headaches occur just as often or even more frequently with the newly approved pill. Even if some blood values are somewhat more favorable, it is unclear whether the slightly increased risk of thrombosis generally associated with birth control pills is actually lower with the new preparation."
Does PrEP reduce the risk of HIV infection?,['The evaluation showed that the risk of HIV infection in the PrEP users was significantly reduced.'],0,"The risk reduction of HIV infection in PrEP users, as stated in the claim, is supported by the sentence indicating a significant reduction in HIV infection risk among PrEP users in the evaluation.","Studies to date have confirmed the preventive effect. People who take PrEP medication correctly have a significantly lower risk of HIV infection. However, infection cannot be completely ruled out."
"Does exercise, a restricted diet, or both together help prevent excessive weight gain during pregnancy?",['The studies in detail Whether exercise programs or a diet change can protect expectant mothers from excessive weight gain is well investigated.'],0,"The studies mentioned do not specify whether exercise programs, a diet change, or both together help prevent excessive weight gain during pregnancy, only that they are well investigated.","The summarized results of previous studies clearly show this.

Does taking antibiotics for acute sinusitis speed up the healing of the infection?,"['They say that antibiotics can shorten acute sinus inflammation a little – but only in a few people.', 'Sickness duration: only 5 out of 100 benefit What is the benefit of taking an antibiotic on the cure, i.e.', 'This means that only 5 out of 100 people with acute rhinosinusitis benefit from taking an antibiotic instead of a dummy medication.']",0,"Only a small fraction of people with acute sinusitis, approximately 5 out of 100, experience a slight reduction in the duration of inflammation when taking antibiotics, as stated in the claim and supported by the sentences.","Taking antibiotics can somewhat speed up the healing of an acute sinus infection. However, the success rate is not exhilarating: antibiotics lead to a faster recovery in only 5 out of 100 people. Pain and impairment in everyday life are not improved. And, of course, antibiotics can cause side effects. All in all, antibiotics often don't have much benefit in acute sinusitis."
Does colonoscopy reduce mortality from colorectal cancer?,"['[a] There is good evidence for the effectiveness of small colonoscopy: A review of the 2013 Cochrane Collaboration shows that it can reduce the risk of colon cancer by about a third [1].', 'Thus, all possible cancer precursors can never be discovered with certainty – only for this reason the claim that one can virtually eradicate colon cancer with this preventive measure is clearly too high.', 'The colonoscopy is an effective method to achieve optimum benefit with minimal side effects, but still requires a lot of research, even if it takes very long-term investigations to obtain clear results.']",0,"While the first sentence supports the claim that colonoscopy can reduce the risk of colon cancer, the second sentence emphasizes the inability to discover all cancer precursors, suggesting that colon cancer cannot be virtually eradicated.","For the small colonoscopy (sigmoidoscopy) an effectiveness is well proven, whether the large colonoscopy (colonoscopy) works even better is not proven. It is not possible that colorectal cancer could be prevented entirely."
Do nicotine replacement products like nicotine gum or nicotine patches help with long-term smoking cessation?,"['Those who called for additional support, such as consultations and discussions with professionals, could further improve the chances of a smoke stop.']",0,"Nicotine replacement products can aid in smoking cessation, but the sentences provided suggest that supplementary support, such as consultations and discussions with professionals, can further enhance success rates.","The benefits of nicotine replacement have been proven in numerous studies. Compared to a placebo, more people manage not to smoke after six months or longer. The success can even be increased somewhat by additional support (counseling, talks)."
"Is short, high-intensity training equally effective as longer, moderate-intensity training?",['Whether the fitness level remains comparable over a long period of time had not been investigated in any of the studies.'],0,"The claim cannot be determined as supported or refuted based on the provided sentence, as it only states that the long-term effectiveness of short, high-intensity training compared to longer, moderate-intensity training was not investigated in the studies.","Yes, possibly.

Is sex as good an endurance workout as running?,"['Canadian researchers compared the energy consumption during sex with a moderate training on a treadmill [1].', 'The result: In a sexual act, both men and women consume significantly less calories on average than in a half-hour treadmill training [1].', 'According to study authors, the performance would be roughly like a leisurely walk.', 'One person found that sex was not more beneficial than treadmill training, whether woman or man is not stated.']",2,"While the study shows that sex consumes fewer calories on average than a half-hour treadmill training, it suggests a performance similar to a leisurely walk, contradicting the claim that sex is as good an endurance workout as running.","Studies show that physical exertion during sex is present but rather moderate. Compared with targeted exercise, the energy expenditure is lower."
Can electrical brain stimulation reduce the amount of food eaten?,"['In two of these [3] [4], the researchers let their subjects eat buffets at will, both after a dummy treatment and after a real electrical brain stimulation.', 'The result: in one of the two studies [3] the tDCS treatment caused the subjects to eat less compared to the dummy treatment.', 'Despite the contradictory results, the participants of both studies indicated that they felt less cravings if they had previously received electrical brain stimulation.', 'Magnetic brain stimulation (rTMS) does not seem to be able to mitigate these ""eating attacks"", according to the cautious results of two small studies [2].', 'Adverse reactions of electrical brain stimulation TDCS were approximately as common in patients treated with sham in clinical trials conducted so far.']",1,"While one study showed a decrease in food consumption after tDCS treatment, another did not, but both studies reported reduced cravings, providing mixed support for the claim.","Electrical brain stimulation may be able to reduce short-term cravings for high-calorie foods. However, it is unclear that the treated persons actually eat less of them; study results on this are contradictory."
Are plastic kitchen boards more hygienic than wooden ones?,"['A thorough search for studies on this issue reveals contradictory results.', 'Some laboratory studies [1-3] [8,9] seem to show that wooden boards are definitely not more hygienic than artificial boards, but in other studies there are no hygiene differences: wooden boards could be released from bacteria as well as plastic [4,5] [7].', 'On the other hand, wooden boards had been used much less frequently by the Salmonella sufferers.']",1,"While some studies suggest that plastic kitchen boards may not have hygiene advantages over wooden ones, wooden boards were less frequently associated with Salmonella occurrences.",Whether wooden boards in the kitchen have hygienic disadvantages is unclear. Previous studies on this are too contradictory to answer this question clearly.
Does excessive beer or alcohol consumption lead to obesity?,"['In some studies, it seems to be exactly the opposite, beer lovers weigh less than little drinkers at the time of the survey.', 'In such a study, men who drank less than three litres a week even seemed to lose weight, and not to increase in weekly amounts of six litres or more.', 'Studies comparing beer with other non-alcoholic beverages other than non-alcoholic beer do not show a clear difference in weight.', 'One reason, according to the authors of an overview of 2011 [2], could be that wine drinkers may tend to become a healthier diet overall.', 'It is also possible that alcohol only has an influence on fat folds on the abdomen and hips from a large amount of time, but it does not lead to weight gain in moderation.']",1,"While some studies suggest beer consumers may weigh less than lighter drinkers, no clear difference is shown when comparing beer to other non-alcoholic beverages, and alcohol might only affect abdominal and hip fat after extended periods, indicating a complex relationship between alcohol consumption and obesity.","In some studies, alcohol consumption does seem to be related to weight gain. In other studies, however, there is either no effect or even the opposite effect. The study situation is contradictory."
Do omega-3 fatty acids or a diet rich in fish help with rheumatoid arthritis?,"['Is this supported by scientific data?', 'Anti-rheumatism effect unproven A Korean team of researchers summarized the results of previously published randomized-controlled studies [1] that investigated the effects of omega-3 fatty acid preparations in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.', 'Their conclusion: there is no valid evidence for such a positive effect in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.']",1,"The claim that omega-3 fatty acids or a diet rich in fish help with rheumatoid arthritis is not supported by a Korean team's analysis of randomized-controlled studies, which found no valid evidence for such a positive effect.","According to the majority of studies, preparations with omega-3 fatty acids cannot improve pain and other symptoms in rheumatoid arthritis. However, the results are sometimes contradictory. The effectiveness of preparations made from the New Zealand green-lipped mussel is also unclear. Whether a diet rich in fish helps is insufficiently studied."
"Does processed red meat (sausages, ham, bacon) increase the risk of cardiovascular disease???","['Possible risk only for processed meat products Meat is not equal to meat.', 'On closer examination, it can be seen that meat products processed with salt, smoked or cured meat may actually increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.', 'A Polish-Swedish research team found a potentially increased probability of disease not only for processed meat products, but also for unprocessed red meat [1].']",0,"The claim that processed red meat increases the risk of cardiovascular disease is supported by the second sentence, stating that meat products processed with salt, smoked, or cured may increase this risk.","Whether unprocessed red meat increases the likelihood of cardiovascular disease is unclear, and study results are conflicting. However, processed red meat such as ham, bacon or sausages could increase the risk."
Does hawthorn extract help patients with heart muscle weakness (heart failure)?,"['Accordingly, it is also unclear over which time period and at which dose the herbal medicinal product should be taken and which patient groups could benefit from a hawthorn intake.', 'In most studies, patients suffering from heart failure took hawthorn preparations as an accompanying therapy in addition to their cardiac medications.', ""So we can't say whether the drug, the hawthorn extract or just the random factor affected the respective result."", 'In fact, those patients who had taken hawthorn were less short of breath, more resilient and showed increased physical performance in the stress ECG.', 'In this study, the intake of hawthorn did not improve the physical resilience or the quality of life of those affected.']",1,"The sentences indicate that while some studies suggest benefits of hawthorn extract for heart failure patients, the specific dosage, time period, and patient groups that would benefit are unclear, and it's been used as an additional therapy, making it hard to determine its independent effect.",The results of the studies found differ significantly and leave more questions open than they answer.
Is glyphosate carcinogenic?,"['Of mice... in the debate about the different assessments, a lot is about studies in rats and mice.', 'Animal studies play a greater role in assessing risks than when it comes to the effectiveness of drugs.', 'Secondly, the animal studies show an increased risk of cancer only when the experimental animals receive a very high dose of glyphosate.', '...and humans In addition to animal studies, there are numerous studies with people on glyphosate The IARC derives from studies in humans a low evidence of an increased risk.', 'The disadvantage: not only the factor that you want to examine, but many other factors can influence the result – for example, when it comes to cancer, lifestyle, smoking, and much more play a role and, to a certain extent, mask the effect of glyphosate.']",1,"While animal studies suggest a potential link between high-dose glyphosate exposure and increased cancer risk, human studies provide low evidence of such a connection, which may be influenced by various confounding factors.","Depending on how much animal experiments and laboratory tests are weighted against studies on humans, one arrives at different assessments. With regard to human studies, we consider the question to be unresolved at present."
Is electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) in combination with ordinary fitness training more efficient than fitness training alone?,"['However, according to a meta-analysis summarising the results of 17 studies, the effect is no greater than in conventional strengthening exercises [ 1 ].', 'Full-body EMS as a fitness method hardly investigated While the electrical stimulation of individual muscle groups for therapeutic purposes was investigated by some research groups, there are hardly any scientific studies on the whole-body EMS as a fitness training replacement.']",1,"The claim is not supported by the first sentence, which states that a meta-analysis found no greater effect of EMS in combination with fitness training compared to conventional strengthening exercises alone.","There is evidence for the principle effectiveness of EMS for muscle strengthening. For a superiority of the combination of EMS and ordinary training compared to fitness training alone, the evidence is contradictory."
Can they delay the progression of eye disease?,"['Progress probably slows down In fact, the summarized results of previously published studies show that a combination of vitamin C, E, beta-carotene and zinc can probably maintain the increasingly deteriorating vision longer.', 'For those with early signs of macular degeneration, this would mean: Without vitamins and minerals, the disease would progress strongly in 15 out of 1000 patients within six years With vitamins and minerals, it would be 11 out of 1000, i.e.']",0,"The claim is supported by the sentences, as they suggest that a specific combination of vitamins and minerals can slow down the progression of eye disease, extending the time before disease progression in some patients.","Vitamin E and beta-carotene cannot prevent the development of age-related macular degeneration. However, in combination with zinc and vitamin C, they probably allow certain forms of an existing disease to progress somewhat more slowly."
Does yoga change the genetic makeup?,"['The genes themselves remain unchanged, only their activity fluctuates; just as in each cell the activity of the different genes is adjusted according to current needs.', 'The difference between a liver cell and a muscle cell is not due to different genes, but to different gene activity.', 'The study shows that shortly after the activity, the gene activity differs from certain white blood cells in these two groups.']",1,"The claim is supported by the sentences, as they explain how yoga can influence gene activity without altering the genes themselves, similar to how different cell types have varying gene activity.",Yoga - like any other physical activity - can influence the activity of genes. But the genes themselves are not changed by it.
Which of the three most common laser eye surgeries produces the best results and has the fewest side effects?,"['However, the study situation is still rather thin, new and large studies could still change somewhat in this assessment.', 'At present, all three methods lead to very good results, which, according to the first long-term studies [3], are likely to be sustainable.', 'Results from a few years ago are no longer meaningful today because the treatment method has changed.', 'Long-term studies therefore always refer to the state of the art at that time, but already suggest that laser treatments are safe and sustainable [1] [2] [3].']",0,"While current long-term studies indicate that all three laser eye surgeries lead to safe and sustainable results, the claim of one method being superior with fewer side effects cannot be supported, as the study situation is still evolving and treatment methods have changed over time.","If only new studies are considered, all three techniques are equally successful. Probable advantages of LASIK: less pain after surgery and good vision more quickly."
"Can electromagnetic fields with a specific pattern (pulsed electromagnetic fields, PEMF) heal injuries?","['Evidence that this pattern in particular has a good therapeutic effect has not been provided.', 'In fact, only a randomized-controlled study on fatigue in multiple sclerosis (MS) [1] and some laboratory results can be found.', 'Apart from the fact that a study on fatigue in a particular disease naturally does not say anything about effects on completely different symptoms, this one study is not yet meaningful: there were very few participants (37) and the intake of medications differed in the experimental and control groups.', 'Many approaches, little evidence Even if the whole variety of similar treatments is considered, there are not enough good studies to prove an effect of PEMF therapies.', 'For a meaningful assessment of PEMF as a form of therapy, studies with good methodology, a higher number of participants and a comparison of the different forms of application (among others) are missing.']",1,"While a single study on fatigue in multiple sclerosis exists and some laboratory results are available, the claim lacks substantial evidence as the study had a small sample size, differing medication intake between groups, and did not address other symptoms or forms of application.","No good injury studies can be found on the device. The only randomized-controlled study treats fatigue in patients with the incurable nerve disease multiple sclerosis and is not very conclusive. Even for the whole range of similar treatment methods, there is no sufficient evidence of efficacy."
Does the drug fingolimod reduce the progression of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis similarly or better than previous drugs?,"['The recently newly approved active substance Fingolimod in Europe causes white blood cells (T cells) to be held back in the lymph nodes, which prevents them from causing inflammation by immigrating to the brain.', 'By means of systematic literature research, we wanted to find out whether fingolimod is similar to or better than previous multiple sclerosis – drugs can inhibit the progression of the disease.']",0,"The first sentence supports the claim by explaining how fingolimod works to reduce inflammation in multiple sclerosis, but the second sentence only mentions the purpose of the literature research without providing any results regarding the comparison with previous drugs.","Two manufacturer-funded clinical trials attest Fingolimod such efficacy that exceeds that of interferon beta therapy. However, the drug can also cause serious side effects."
Can some forms of headache be successfully treated with heat?,"['Accordingly, there is no scientific evidence of the effectiveness of this measure.', 'However, there is no sufficient evidence to support this claim.', 'A Cochrane overview work from 2004 [1] investigates all non-invasive physical treatment methods for all forms of headache: Heat treatment plays only a very small role according to this study (dryer is not mentioned) – heat was tested in combination with other measures: In one study, the combination of heat, home training and stretching is worse than a combination of biofeedback and relaxation.']",1,"While a Cochrane overview from 2004 investigated non-invasive physical treatment methods for all headache forms and found heat to play a minor role, there is no scientific evidence or sufficient support specifically demonstrating the effectiveness of heat treatment for headaches.","Heat on tense muscles is pleasant, but no evidence exists that the tension is released and the headache is relieved."
Does electro-acupuncture on the ear help against pain?,"['Thus, the repeated electrical irritation of acupuncture points on the ear seems to be able to stop some chronic neck or cross pain [ 2, 3 ].', 'The pain could not be brought to total disappearance, but the study participants needed less painkillers than without electro-acupuncture over the duration of a few weeks.', 'Acupuncture on the ear probably effective against pain Overall, different acupuncture methods on the ear may effectively reduce pain.']",0,"The claim is partially supported by the sentences, as they suggest a reduction in pain and need for painkillers with electro-acupuncture on the ear, but total disappearance of pain was not achieved.","Electro-ear acupuncture could be supportive against chronic pain such as neck or low back pain. The method cannot completely replace painkillers. For surgery-related pain, the effectiveness is uncertain."
Is screening by optical coherence tomography superior to conventional examinations for the early detection of diabetic macular edema?,"['Early detection: Optical coherence tomography unreliable Most diabetes patients with such pathological retinal damage will not notice symptoms such as dark spots in the field of vision or impairment of sharp vision long after the start.', 'However, laser treatment is not without risk, in some cases it may also result in an unwanted reduction in vision or other side effects that affect vision.']",2,"The claim is refuted by the first sentence, which states that optical coherence tomography is unreliable for early detection of diabetic macular edema, as most patients will not notice symptoms until after the start of pathological retinal damage.","No, screening by optical coherence tomography alone is too inaccurate. An examination using an ophthalmoscope and pupil dilating eye drops or with the help of fundus photography is a safer method."
Does the treatment of diabetes-related retinal diseases by injection of VEGF inhibitors provide an advantage compared to conventional laser treatment?,"['The majority (5 out of 100 inhabitants) suffer from type 2 diabetes (formerly also called age diabetes), which is practically always lifestyle-related and in most cases is accompanied by overweight, one-sided diet and lack of exercise [ 4 ].', 'The presentation of the effectiveness of VEGF inhibitor injections as a new treatment method is also clearly exaggerated and biased – the newspaper article does not inform about risks and uncertainties.']",0,"The claim that VEGF inhibitor injections provide an advantage over conventional laser treatment for diabetes-related retinal diseases is not directly supported or refuted by the sentences, as they discuss the prevalence of type 2 diabetes and the bias in presenting the effectiveness of VEGF inhibitor injections without mentioning comparative risks or uncertainties.","There is evidence of better short-term efficacy for VEGF inhibitor injections compared with laser coagulation, but the method is insufficiently studied. Whether the effect is safe in the long term and effective at the same time is unclear."
