Can monk's pepper reduce PMS symptoms? PMS is the abbreviation for premenstrual syndrome. This refers to complaints that occur in the days before menstruation.,"['Reference to efficacy in PMS According to previous studies, monk peppers could actually help in PMS.', 'The summarized study results indicate that the symptoms with monk pepper are reduced in more patients than with a sham medication (placebo).', 'Therefore, it would be possible for monk peppers to act against PMS symptoms such as breast spacing.']",0,The second sentence directly supports the claim by indicating that more patients experienced reduced PMS symptoms with monk pepper than with a placebo.,"In the studies to date, monk's pepper seems to relieve PMS symptoms better than a placebo. However, this is not well proven, because the studies have significant weaknesses. There is no evidence of an effect on menstrual disorders. Significant studies are lacking."
Can CBD (cannabidiol) help with migraines or other headaches?,"['Apparently, CBD has never been investigated to see if it can help with migraine seizures.', 'The claim that CBD would help with migraines or headaches is pure speculation.', 'The studies in detail Despite extensive search in three databases, we could not find any studies on CBD against migraine or other types of headache, neither for treatment nor for prevention.']",1,"The claim that CBD can help with migraines or headaches is not supported by the provided sentences, which indicate a lack of studies on this topic.",There are no studies that have investigated the effectiveness of CBD against migraine. So claims that CBD can help with or prevent migraine attacks have no scientific basis. The same is true for other types of headache.
Can ginkgo extract improve mental performance in dementia patients?,"['Dementia patients taking Ginkgo extract often seemed to perform better in thinking, memory, and concentration tasks than those who swallowed placebo preparations without an active substance [1.3].', 'Although the studies indicate that Ginkgo extract can help people with dementia, the significance of the individual studies is limited.']",0,"The first sentence supports the claim that Ginkgo extract may improve mental performance in dementia patients, but the second sentence suggests the significance of individual studies is limited, indicating potential inconsistency or uncertainty in the evidence.",Previous studies suggest that ginkgo extract can improve mental performance in dementia - but this is not well established. It is not possible to say exactly how large this effect is.
Do green-lipped mussel preparations improve the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis?,"['For us, therefore, this claim is not credible.', 'Whether green-lipped mussel helps with rheumatism or not, can therefore not be said for sure at the moment.', 'Whether the results can be transferred to other products or other dosages is unclear.', ""The studies are all badly done according to today's standard: so it is unclear how reliable the measurements of the treatment success are."", 'Whether rheumatism patients would still benefit from green-lipped mussel preparations remains unclear.']",1,"The claim is not supported by the sentences, as there is no certainty about the effectiveness of green-lipped mussel preparations for rheumatoid arthritis due to unreliable studies and unclear transferability of results.","Five small studies provide no overall evidence of benefit from green-lipped mussel in rheumatism. However, the rheumatism treatment of the participants does not meet today's standards and the studies were very poorly conducted. Therefore, we cannot draw any reliable conclusions from these studies."
Can low-level laser therapy reduce wrist osteoarthritis pain?,"['There is a well-made study on wrist arthritis: it showed no difference in efficacy between low-level laser therapy and placebo treatment.', 'This was not the case, the laser treatment could not relieve the pain better than placebo treatment.']",2,"The claim that low-level laser therapy can reduce wrist osteoarthritis pain is refuted by the provided sentences, which state that a study showed no difference in efficacy between laser therapy and placebo treatment.","In the pain treatment of wrist osteoarthritis, no efficacy can be assumed - this is indicated by the results of a small but well-done study. Research results on knee osteoarthritis are contradictory and therefore of little significance. We did not find any reliable studies on hip osteoarthritis."
"Does taking polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as omega-3 and omega-6, reduce ADHD symptoms in children?","['Overall, the preparations do not seem to make children with ADHD quieter and more concentrated.', 'Whether omega fatty acid preparations or placebo, all children showed similarly strong ADHD symptoms.', 'On closer examination, it appears that the best-performed, blinded studies show no or even a negative effect of the omega fatty acid preparations on the behaviour of the participating children.']",2,"The claim is refuted by the sentences, as they suggest that omega fatty acid preparations, including omega-3 and omega-6, do not reduce ADHD symptoms in children, and may even have a negative effect on their behavior.","Studies to date suggest that supplements containing polyunsaturated fatty acids (for example, omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids) tend not to have a noticeable effect on attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, the quality of the studies is not sufficient to provide definitive answers."
"Can ozone therapy, in which autologous blood is treated with ozone and recycled, favorably influence the course of COVID-19 disease?","['There are no differences between standard treatment and additional ozone therapy – neither in the progression of Covid-19 disease nor in the risk of death.', 'An advantage for ozone therapy did not arise, for none of the comparisons there was a clear difference: neither for the risk of death to Covid-19 nor for the course of the disease [5].', 'Thus, the sole effect of autologous ozone therapy has not been established here either.']",1,"The sentences provide evidence that ozone therapy does not show a clear advantage over standard treatment in reducing the risk of death or improving the course of COVID-19 disease, which contradicts the claim of a favorable influence.",The few studies on this subject have gross deficiencies and are therefore not conclusive. Their results do not provide any evidence of efficacy of ozone therapy.
Does dimenhydrinate relieve travel nausea better than a placebo?,"['However, we are very sceptical here: we consider the results to be so little meaningful that we can neither see any evidence of effectiveness nor exclude it.', 'In general, it remains questionable how reliable the results can be transferred to other situations where travel sickness occurs.', 'However, we do not consider this assessment to be meaningful: the number of test subjects was far too small, and, therefore, the fluctuation range was far too large.']",1,The small number of test subjects and large fluctuation range make it difficult to rely on the study's results or draw conclusions about dimenhydrinate's effectiveness in relieving travel nausea compared to a placebo.,"The best available studies on the subject are unfortunately not conclusive, for example because they were quite small and the publications lack many details for traceability.  Therefore, we can neither prove nor exclude an effect."
Does dimenhydrinate relieve travel nausea as well as the proven drug scopolamine???,"['According to study authors, dimenhydrinate is supposed to help better than a placebo but has a worse effect than the proven drug Scopolamine.']",1,"The claim that dimenhydrinate relieves travel nausea as well as scopolamine is not supported, as stated by the study authors, who found dimenhydrinate to have a worse effect than scopolamine.","The best available studies on the subject are unfortunately not conclusive, for example because they were quite small and the publications lack many details for traceability.  Therefore, we can neither prove nor exclude an effect."
Does short-term fasting reduce the side effects of chemotherapy for cancer???,"['On this basis, we cannot reliably say whether fasting during chemotherapy is actually useful or not, thus reducing side effects and improving the quality of life.', 'Whether fasting prevents or mitigates the side effects of chemotherapy is also not clear from the results: In one of the studies [1a] there was no difference in side effects such as fatigue or nerve pain: they were similarly common and similarly severe in both groups.', 'All of this means that the results of the studies are extremely uncertain and we cannot see or exclude the effectiveness of fasting.']",1,"The claim that short-term fasting reduces the side effects of chemotherapy for cancer is not supported, as the studies show unclear results with no significant difference in side effects between fasting and non-fasting groups.",We found only three very small studies on both questions. Their results are so unreliable that we cannot make any assessment. So we cannot say whether the quality of life of those affected is improved and whether fasting during chemotherapy reduces side effects.
Are extracts of Artemisa annua (annual mugwort) or the active ingredient artemisinin obtained from it effective against coronavirus?,"['We have not found any studies to prevent Corona infection.', 'However, it has several inconsistencies, so it cannot answer whether Artemisia helps the sick.', 'However, the limited anti-malaria effect of artemisinin does not indicate efficacy against other diseases.', 'For several reasons, we do not consider these results to be reliable: The standard treatment differed greatly: some of the participants received, for example, cortisone-containing drugs that are known to be effective, while others did not.']",1,"The claim remains unsupported as there is no evidence provided for Artemisia annua or artemisinin preventing Corona infection, its effectiveness in helping the sick is inconsistent, and the limited anti-malaria effect of artemisinin does not necessarily indicate efficacy against other diseases, moreover, the reliability of the results is questioned due to varying standard treatments.","To date, only one study can be found that investigated Artemisia treatment in mild covid-19 progression. However, due to numerous shortcomings, the results are not conclusive. It has not been studied whether Artemisia helps or prevents severe covid 19 disease or whether the plant can prevent coronavirus infection."
Can zinc mitigate the progression of Covid-19?,"['Thus zinc should not cause Covid-19 sufferers to get better more quickly [3].', 'However, compared to the other half that did not take zinc, they did not recover faster.', 'So these results suggest that zinc treatment at Covid-19 is not helpful.']",2,"The claim that zinc can mitigate the progression of Covid-19 is refuted by the sentences, as there is no evidence suggesting that zinc treatment leads to faster recovery in Covid-19 patients compared to those not taking zinc.",The results of two studies on this suggest that sufferers with Covid-19 do not recover more quickly with zinc than without. A preventive effect has not yet been investigated in studies.
Does a cold spray with trypsin protect against colds or covid-19? Does the spray reduce symptoms and duration of illness?,"['No previously published study has investigated whether the cold spray can prevent a disease.', 'Thus, it is not certain that the cold spray shortens the duration of a cold.', 'If you look at the number of people who report cold complaints after artificial infection (21 out of 23 in the spray group, 16 out of 23 in the placebo group), there is no clear difference that speaks for a preventive effect of the cold spray.', 'Therefore, we do not consider the results of the study meaningful: With spray, the participants assessed the duration of their cold shorter (7.7 days) than without spray (10.4 days).', 'Interestingly, there was no clear difference between the two groups: The spray group did not reach much less to other colds than the control group.']",1,"The claim that a cold spray with trypsin protects against colds or COVID-19 and reduces symptoms and duration of illness is not supported, as no clear difference in cold prevention was found between the spray and placebo groups, and self-reported cold duration in the spray group was shorter, but deemed not meaningful by the study.",The question was investigated in two small studies with gross deficiencies. They cannot prove that treatment with the cold spray relieves symptoms or shortens the duration of illness. Whether the spray has a preventive effect has not been researched for either colds or Covid-19.
"Does injecting low-dose Corona vaccine into the skin (mesotherapy vaccination, microvaccination) protect against Covid-19 as well as proven full-dose vaccination into muscle?","['Whether the mesotherapy vaccination against the coronavirus protects against a covid-19 disease is not researched.', 'Whether Corona vaccination by mesotherapy provides effective protection against Covid-19 remains unclear.']",1,"The claim that skin injection of low-dose Corona vaccine offers the same protection as full-dose muscle vaccination is not supported, as there is no research yet on mesotherapy vaccination's effectiveness against Covid-19, leaving protection uncertain.","Some doctors offer corona vaccination using the so-called mesotherapeutic method. Here, vaccination is administered into the skin instead of into the upper arm muscle, with a fraction of the tested and approved dose. Such applications have not been explored for the Corona vaccines. Effective protection against Covid-19 is not assured."
Do herbal remedies with nasturtium and horseradish (Kren) prevent recurrent cystitis?,"['In the prevention study, it can be seen that the herbal product and the sham medication did not differ significantly in the case of symptoms such as nausea or allergic reactions [1].', 'According to this, the capuchin cress-meerrettiche preparation probably does not offer any preventive protection.']",2,"The claim is refuted by the sentences provided, as they suggest that the herbal product containing nasturtium and horseradish does not provide significant preventive protection against symptoms such as nausea or allergic reactions, which are relevant to the context of recurrent cystitis prevention.","As for prevention, we have found only one small but somewhat reliable study. According to this, nasturtium-horseradish remedies probably cannot prevent cystitis. For the treatment of cystitis, we were also only able to evaluate one study. However, it leaves too many questions unanswered to be able to clearly assess its effectiveness."
Can homeopathic remedies relieve colds in children??,"['Children who regularly took homeopathic medicines were not less likely to become ill in the meaningful studies and their colds were not milder.', 'The few well-executed studies clearly showed no effect of homeopathy against colds.']",2,The claim that homeopathic remedies can relieve colds in children is refuted by the sentences stating that children who took homeopathic medicines were not less likely to become ill and that well-executed studies showed no effect of homeopathy against colds.,"Well-done studies find neither a preventive nor an alleviating effect of homeopathy on children's colds (chills). However, these studies have examined too few children for a truly conclusive result. Larger studies would be needed for a clear answer.  It is not scientifically plausible that homeopathic remedies are effective."
Can treatments with ultrasound relieve the pain of osteoarthritis?,"['In three studies [3-5], there was no clear benefit from the treatment in the ultrasound group.', '[2] Many promises, little behind osteoarthritis can greatly affect the quality of life.', 'The summary of the different study results, although purely mathematically, indicated that ultrasound as therapy has no analgesic effect.', 'Therefore, better studies must clarify the potential efficacy of ultrasound therapy against osteoarthritis pain.']",1,"While some sources highlight the significant impact of osteoarthritis on quality of life, multiple studies indicate no clear benefit or analgesic effect from ultrasound treatment, suggesting a need for further investigation.","A number of studies have investigated whether ultrasound can help with osteoarthritis of the knee joints. However, their results are not conclusive; the study results are too contradictory to make a definite statement. For osteoarthritis of the hip or hands, this has not been investigated at all."
Does regular exercise reduce the severity and duration of colds and other respiratory infections?,"['However, the studies indicate that regular exercise can reduce the duration and severity of respiratory infections.', 'Thus, regular exercise increases life expectancy and reduces, among other things, the risk of cardiovascular diseases such as heart attack or stroke diabetes cancer depression.', 'The studies suggest that although the number of infections can not be reduced by sport, it may be a little milder for the duration of the disease and for the duration of the disease as a whole.']",0,"Regular exercise's ability to reduce the duration and severity of respiratory infections, as indicated in the studies, supports the claim.","Previous studies suggest that sports-playing people may be just as likely to have respiratory infections as sports-muffle people. However, the illnesses are likely to be somewhat less severe and a bit shorter overall."
"Can cold showers, cold baths or cold water treading according to Kneipp prevent colds and respiratory infections in adults?","['After evaluating the best available studies, we have come to the conclusion that the question is simply not well enough to speak out for or against effectiveness.', 'These studies, too, cannot demonstrate or exclude any effect.']",1,"The claim cannot be supported or refuted as the available studies do not provide sufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of cold showers, baths, or water treading in preventing colds and respiratory infections in adults.",The three studies conducted to date are too deficient to answer this question.
"Can filtering out blue light using blue filter glasses or night mode settings on smartphone, tablet or laptop screens have a beneficial effect on sleep?","['With activated blue filter night mode or blue filter glasses, the participants took a similar amount of time to fall asleep as without blue filter.', ""Perhaps the amount of blue light on tablets, smartphones, ebook readers or laptop screens is not enough to disturb the body's own melatonin production."", 'The overall study situation now indicates that blue light from screen devices has no influence on sleep.']",2,"The claim is refuted by the sentences, as they suggest that blue light from screens does not affect melatonin production or sleep time, whether filters are used or not.","In previous studies, it makes no noticeable difference to sleep when the blue light component of display screen devices is filtered out in the evening. However, the results are not well validated because the studies are of low quality and usually only examined a few people."
Can regular intake of vitamin C prevent colds?,"['Although those who swallow vitamin C preventatively are probably a little shorter ill in case of a cold, the effect seems small: With an average duration of seven days of disease, vitamin C would reduce to six to six and a half days of disease.', 'A clear advantage was not shown – the number of participants who had been cold was hardly lower with vitamin C than with placebo.']",2,"The claim that regular intake of vitamin C can prevent colds is refuted by the sentences, as they indicate while it may reduce the duration of a cold slightly, there is no clear advantage in terms of reducing the number of people who contract a cold when comparing vitamin C to a placebo.","Preventive intake of high-dose vitamin C for a long time does not prevent the occurrence of colds. However, it can reduce the average duration of illness by half a day to a day from a week. Vitamin C is unlikely to improve a cold that has already occurred."
Do saline nasal rinses and nasal sprays or inhaling with steam from saline solution help with colds?,"['It is still unclear whether they have a positive effect on colds.', 'Whether salt water – whether as a rinsing, inhalation or spray – can relieve the discomfort of colds or shorten the disease remains unclear.', ""So whether salt water helps the nose with colds, we can't say.""]",1,"While the claim suggests a potential benefit of saline nasal rinses, sprays, or steam inhalation for colds, the provided sentences indicate that the evidence is not conclusive, aligning with the ""Not enough information"" label.",Whether nasal rinses or nasal sprays with salt water help with colds (chills) with a blocked or runny nose cannot be answered by the studies conducted to date. This is because they come to contradictory results and are not very conclusive. Whether inhaling with steam from hot salt water helps with colds has not yet been researched.
Do remedies with ginseng help with erectile dysfunction?,"['No significant effect The current study suggests that no significant improvement can be expected.', 'According to studies, erection ability and satisfaction with sexual intercourse did not increase significantly on average.']",2,"The sentences provide evidence that ginseng remedies do not lead to significant improvements in erectile dysfunction, directly refuting the claim.","Previous studies suggest that dietary supplements with ginseng tend not to bring a significant change. This means that neither erectile function nor sexual satisfaction are likely to improve. At the very least, however, side effects are not likely to occur in large numbers. All assessments are not well substantiated."
Can weighted blankets help with sleep disorders?,"['No evidence of efficacy The result of our research is sobering: We could not find clear indications of a sleep-enhancing effect.', 'Movement measurements of the participants showed that they did not sleep calmer or longer with a weight cover.', 'These results suggest that weight covers do not help with sleep disorders.', 'A positive effect of weight covers on the disturbed sleep is therefore questionable – but we cannot exclude them either.', 'This means: Whether with a heavy or a light blanket – on average there was no difference in total sleep time, time to fall asleep and waking up after the first sleep.']",1,"The research findings indicate no significant difference in sleep patterns between using a weighted blanket and not, which does not support the claim of weighted blankets aiding sleep disorders.","Studies to date find no convincing evidence of effective help for sleep disorders - at least in autistic children and adults with mental illness. However, a benefit cannot be ruled out either. More research is needed."
Does the drug remdesivir prevent COVID-19 deaths?,"['The results are sobering: Remdesivir treatment probably does not prevent deaths from Covid-19 [1,2].', 'However, Remdesivir is unlikely to be a significant aid in the treatment of Covid-19.', 'Not when it comes to the risk of dying: after two to four weeks Remdesivir had died about the same number of people as without Remdesivir.', 'In the studies, an average of 10 to 11 out of 100 patients died within one month, whether they had received Remdesivir, an ineffective dummy medication (placebo) or the usual medical care [1,2].', 'Remdesivir therefore does not seem to prevent deaths.']",2,"The claim that remdesivir prevents COVID-19 deaths is refuted by the sentences, as they indicate similar death rates among patients treated with remdesivir, placebo, or standard medical care.","For some time, great hope was placed in Remdesivir in the fight against the pandemic. According to the studies conducted so far, however, the drug cannot prevent deaths from Covid-19. It is of little help that the disease seems to worsen somewhat more slowly with Remdesivir."
Does carnosine relieve autism symptoms in children?,"['We have found four studies [1-4] that all come to the same conclusion: They indicate that carnosine is ineffective [5].', 'Summary results with limited expressiveness No improvement (or deterioration) of symptoms was seen in any of the studies – neither in social interaction, communication, nor in rigid, repeated behaviors.', 'A summary analysis of the study results [5] also indicated no improvement.']",2,"The four studies mentioned in the claim consistently show that carnosine does not alleviate autism symptoms in children, as no improvement was observed in social interaction, communication, or rigid, repeated behaviors.","Previous studies suggest a lack of efficacy. However, the small number of participants and shortcomings in the study design reduce the significance of the results."
Can ginkgo extract relieve the symptoms of tinnitus?,"['All three studies came to the same conclusion: Ginkgo extract cannot relieve tinnitus better than placebo (a dummy medicine).', ""So Ginkgo doesn't help with tinnitus better than a placebo – but it probably doesn't hurt either.""]",2,"The claim that ginkgo extract can relieve tinnitus symptoms is refuted by the sentences stating all three studies found ginkgo extract ineffective compared to a placebo, and it likely causes no harm.","Preparations with ginkgo extract cannot help with tinnitus. They do not reduce the volume of the ringing in the ears any more than a placebo. This is the result of a summary of the most significant studies, which all came to the same conclusion."
Do remedies with ginkgo help against tinnitus in people with dementia?,"['We can therefore neither affirm nor exclude that drugs containing ginkgo extract have a positive influence on the tinnitus of dementia sufferers.', 'Missing information When reading the individual studies [1-4], it remains unclear how many of the dementia patients studied had tinnitus at all – and how the symptoms of this particular subgroup of subjects have changed in the course of the study.', 'In the individual studies [1-4], there is also a lack of information as to whether the tinnitus patients from the ginkgo and placebo groups were similar enough for a fair comparison.']",1,The claim cannot be supported or refuted because the studies lack clear information on the number of dementia patients with tinnitus and the comparability of the tinnitus patients in the ginkgo and placebo groups.,"The efficacy of ginkgo against tinnitus in dementia patients has been co-tested in a few studies. Some of these studies are not well understood. Based on the results published so far, we cannot make a clear assessment of efficacy - i.e. neither confirm nor exclude that ginkgo helps in this case."
Does garlic protect against corona infections?,"['Not studied: Anti-Corona effect We have therefore been looking for meaningful studies.', 'However, we have not found any such study to protect us from Corona.']",1,"The claim that garlic protects against corona infections is not supported by the provided sentences, which mention no studies demonstrating its anti-corona effect.","We could not find a single meaningful study on the protective effect of garlic against Corona infections. There is no scientific basis for such claims. On the question of whether garlic protects against colds, we were able to evaluate only one study. However, this is relatively small and has gross weaknesses. The supposedly positive result is therefore not reliable."
Are heavy (ex-)smokers less likely to die of lung cancer if they regularly participate in lung cancer screening by computed tomography (CT)?,"['Probably a little less deaths due to lung cancer The benefits and damage of a systematic screening of lung cancer by computer tomography (short: CT) for current or former strong smokers is documented in two current systematic overviews [1,2].', 'Without screening, 28 out of 1000 participants died of lung cancer With screening, 23 out of 1000 participants died of lung cancer 5 out of 1000 participants were spared a death from lung cancer by screening.', 'This means that we know with quite high certainty that the screenings (some few) of lung cancer deaths in the risk group prevent.', 'In addition, early lung cancer detection sometimes also detects early forms of cancer that would never have caused problems during their lifetime.']",0,"The claim is supported by the sentences, as they indicate a reduction in lung cancer deaths among heavy smokers who undergo screening, from 28 to 23 deaths per 1000 participants, thus preventing 5 deaths.","Screening in the high-risk group probably prevents deaths from lung cancer. Whether the screened individuals actually live longer and have a higher quality of life is not clear. There are also risks: On the one hand, some screened individuals receive a diagnosis of lung cancer but would not have experienced symptoms during their lifetime. Furthermore, a small proportion of screened individuals must expect a false-positive result (""false alarm""). Until the all-clear is given, interventions are necessary for clarification, during which complications can occur."
Do preparations containing rockrose have a preventive or soothing effect on colds (chills) and other upper respiratory tract infections? Can they protect against infections with the coronavirus?,"['We did not find any studies on the preventive effect of cistrose preparations.', ""This lacks the scientific basis for the manufacturer's claim that cistrose lollipops would protect against colds or even coronas."", 'For this purpose, participants with cold, throat ache or cough sucked several times a day either pastilles with a cistrose extract or pastilles without active substance (placebo).', 'Nor could we find any studies to prevent colds.']",1,"The claim that rockrose preparations can prevent or soothe colds, or protect against coronavirus, lacks scientific basis as no studies supporting these claims were found.","Whether tea, lozenges, or other remedies containing cistus protect against colds has never been studied in humans. There are also no such studies on the preventive effect of cistus against corona.  Whether cistus preparations relieve the symptoms of colds (with colds, sore throats, coughs) or even covid-19 has not been clarified. We did find one study that investigated cistus lozenges for various mild to severe upper respiratory tract infections caused by viruses and bacteria. However, this study has serious flaws and does not provide definite answers about efficacy for colds."
Is plasma therapy for covid-19 effective in preventing deaths?,"['For all individuals combined – from slightly affected to life-threatening – no clear benefit has been seen from plasma therapy.', 'The summary of five studies [2-4,6,7] also makes it impossible to estimate how compatible plasma therapy is for covid-19 patients.', 'But the observed positive effect can be due to chance, and once again no reliable statement can be derived: neither that the plasma therapy at Covid-19 is safe nor that it carries a comparatively high risk.']",1,"The claim that plasma therapy for COVID-19 is effective in preventing deaths is not supported, as there is no clear benefit seen from plasma therapy, and its compatibility for patients cannot be estimated based on the available studies.","The summary of studies to date leaves a range of possibilities open. Overall, the data from mildly to fatally ill patients do not demonstrate either a positive effect or negative effects. Serious side effects have not been sufficiently researched and cannot be ruled out."
Can contact with holy water make you sick?,"['It is unclear, however, whether the type and quantity of germs in it is a health risk at all for believers.', 'How the usual contact with holy water can make you ill is virtually unexplored.', 'However, laboratory analyses cannot answer how much contact with the water is necessary to get sick.']",1,"The claim that holy water can make believers sick is unsupported, as the type and quantity of germs, as well as the necessary contact for illness, remain largely unexplored and unclear based on the provided sentences.","Pathogens often live in holy water basins. However, whether the usual contact with holy water can actually make people ill has not been researched."
Can Echinacea protect against colds?,"['People who swallowed echinacea preparations were slightly less likely to catch a cold in studies.', 'The protective effect of Echinacea is probably rather low and would look like this: If 100 people take an active-free dummy preparation, around 54 get a cold.', 'A little less colds from Echinacea According to the summarized results of all studies, a little less people in the Echinacea group became ill than in the group that received the dummy medication.', 'The regular intake of Echinacea products could thus possibly prevent the occurrence of a cold.', 'According to the study, they were less ill if they also took echinacea.']",0,The claim that Echinacea can protect against colds is supported by the sentences indicating a slight reduction in cold occurrence among those who took Echinacea preparations in studies.,"Regular intake of echinacea extracts could possibly offer some protection against colds. However, the effect seems to be small. It is unclear whether the plant is also suitable for treatment. Study results on this are contradictory."
Can echinacea relieve the discomfort of colds???,"['No clues to help with colds Unfortunately, the available studies cannot answer whether preparations with Echinacea help if the cold is already there.', 'Effect in case of illness remains unclear Whether Echinacea also helps if the cold is already there, remains unclear despite studies.']",1,"The claim that echinacea can relieve the discomfort of colds is not supported, as the studies mentioned in the sentences do not provide clear evidence for its effectiveness once a cold has already developed.","Regular intake of echinacea extracts could possibly offer some protection against colds.

Does taking LaVita promote health or physical and mental performance? (Reader inquiry),"['Man is not a test tube The results of unpublished investigations, summarized on the website, do not answer whether LaVita consumption significantly improves health and well-being.', 'Whether the preparation of LaVita also had a direct and noticeable effect on health or mental or physical performance was not investigated in the study.', 'However, the study cannot demonstrate that this is due to the use of LaVita.']",1,"The claim that LaVita promotes health or physical and mental performance is not directly supported by the provided sentences, as they state that no investigation was conducted on the direct effects of LaVita on health, well-being, or performance.",There are no studies that have directly tested this question.
Does taking coenzyme Q10 improve movement disorders in Parkinson's disease?,"['No proven benefit of coenzyme Q10 However, this review results in a rather disappointing result: Movement disorders with coenzyme Q10 are likely to develop similar to those with a sham medication.', ""This means that, according to current knowledge, coenzyme Q10 has no positive effect on Parkinson's typical movement disorders."", 'However, evidence of ineffectiveness of coenzyme Q10 outweighs it.', 'There are no significant differences between coenzyme Q10 and placebo, which would in principle be a good tolerability.']",2,"The claim that coenzyme Q10 improves movement disorders in Parkinson's disease is refuted by the sentences stating no proven benefit, similar development of movement disorders compared to sham medication, no positive effect, and no significant differences between coenzyme Q10 and placebo.","Previous studies suggest that the intake of coenzyme Q10 does not tend to bring about any improvement in movement disorders typical of Parkinson's disease. However, this assessment is not well substantiated."
Does ozonated vegetable oil help against athlete's foot or nail fungus?,"['However, only with little success: For internal use (drips for swallowing) of ozonated vegetable oils we could not find any studies that are at least reasonably meaningful.', 'The question whether ozonated oils help at least as well with various fungal infections as conventional drugs cannot be answered for us.', 'For us, however, this is no evidence that ozonated oil is a good alternative to conventional anti-fungal agents.']",1,"The claim that ozonated vegetable oil helps against athlete's foot or nail fungus is not supported, as there is no significant evidence found for its internal use and it remains unclear if it performs as well as conventional drugs.",We could not find any studies on these questions that we considered trustworthy.
Are health checks of symptom-free individuals (screening) effective in containing the pandemic?,"['However, questioning and measuring fevers as screening unsuitable people for possible complaints, their itinerary or contacts with patients does not seem to provide reliable results.', 'It is currently uncertain whether rapid tests at the airport, at the border or in health facilities can deliver reliable results and thus slow down the spread of the corona virus.', 'According to these studies, both fever tests and surveys cannot reliably identify infected people as such.', 'The research team cannot answer whether it can inhibit the spread of the Coronavirus to test complaint-free persons for the virus by means of a rapid test.']",1,"The sentences suggest that health checks such as fever tests and surveys are not reliable in identifying infected individuals, and it is uncertain whether rapid tests can slow the spread of the virus, which does not support the claim of effectiveness in containing the pandemic.","Fever measurement at the border, questioning about complaints, or regular corona tests for health care workers: so-called screening involves examining people without complaints for a possible infection. Whether this can slow down the pandemic, however, is not well established. It is also unclear how reliably the series of health checks can distinguish infected from non-infected people. There is currently not enough solid data on this."
Does sunscreen reduce the likelihood of skin cancer?,"['The combined results of previous studies cannot clearly show that sunscreen reduces the risk of skin cancer [3,4].', 'Although studies have been carried out on this issue for 40 years, they are only limited in meaning and come to contradictory results.', 'Both reviews are of high quality, have slightly different strengths and weaknesses, but come to the same conclusion: Due to the very different study results, an influence of sunscreen on the risk of skin cancer cannot be proven.', 'However, we consider the significance of these studies to be very low.']",1,"The claim that sunscreen reduces the likelihood of skin cancer is not supported by the provided sentences, which state that studies on this topic have been conducted for 40 years but their results are contradictory and of low significance, and that two high-quality reviews reached the same conclusion of no proven influence of sunscreen on skin cancer risk.","Although sunscreen protects the skin from sunburn, it has not yet been proven that it can also prevent skin cancer.

Does aromatherapy have a calming effect on agitation and aggression typical of dementia?,"['Apart from this exception (Lavendel-Aromatherapie), we do not know whether aromatherapy can help people with dementia [1] : Due to the current study situation, we cannot confirm or exclude efficacy.', 'We cannot make reliable statements about the safety or possible side effects of aromatherapy in dementia, even in long-term use.', 'However, we do not assume that aromatherapy has a very large, previously undiscovered positive effect on the symptoms and quality of life of dementia sufferers.', 'Aromatherapy is intended to help against sleep disorders, depression or pain and is quite popular – although the scientific evidence generally leaves much to be desired [1].']",1,"While aromatherapy is used for various conditions and may help with sleep disorders, depression, or pain, there is currently not enough evidence to confirm or exclude its efficacy in alleviating agitation and aggression in dementia, and safety concerns remain unaddressed.","Based on the state of studies, it is largely unclear whether aromatherapy can help patients with dementia. There are quite a few studies on the subject, but many of them have gross flaws and are therefore not comparable. For example, studies with lemon balm aromatherapy have contradictory results. With lavender aromatherapy, on the other hand, a certain tendency has emerged: it does not seem to help against agitation and aggression - both typical accompanying symptoms of dementia."
Do phthalates reduce the likelihood of pregnancy in women?,"['However, measurement problems and a number of missing data ensured that the results of this study were not reliable.', 'Whether women have greater difficulty in becoming pregnant through phthalates can only be proven by more rigorous studies carried out in a larger number of female participants.', 'However, the study does not reliably identify whether women with high phthalate levels have had major problems becoming pregnant.']",1,The study's measurement issues and missing data prevent reliable conclusions about phthalates reducing pregnancy likelihood in women.,"In animal studies, some phthalates may promote infertility. Previous research in men suggests that levels of phthalates found in everyday life may reduce the quality of sperm cells in humans. This association is not well established, and it is unclear to what extent it affects fertility. Whether the plasticizers prevent women from becoming pregnant has not yet been investigated in meaningful studies."
Does leaky gut syndrome cause health complaints or diseases?,"['In scientific medicine, the term Leaky Gut Syndrome is unknown, even in medical literature databases, almost no publications can be found.', 'So no one can describe exactly what Leaky Gut Syndrome is, but explanations remain vague.', 'No indication of cause of disease As far as the causes of the mentioned intestinal diseases are concerned, science is still largely in the dark.', 'Accordingly, the treatment of unscientifically proven ""diagnosis"" Leaky Gut syndrome is questionable.', 'However, it is not possible to check whether these measures can fix the supposed Leaky Gut syndrome, since it is not clear how this syndrome can be detected at all.']",1,"While the term ""Leaky Gut Syndrome"" is not recognized in scientific medicine, with vague explanations and lack of detection methods making it difficult to verify or disprove associated health complaints or diseases.","There is no clear definition of what leaky gut syndrome is. In fact, the intestinal mucosa is more permeable than usual in some diseases. However, it is unclear whether this is a cause or the consequence of the respective disease."
"Does an extract from the root of the Cape geranium (Pelargonium sidoides, Umckaloabo) work against bronchitis?","['Overall, the results of previous studies give cautious evidence that Pelargonium drops could cause bronchitis (and the associated cough) to disappear faster [1,2].', 'The summarized results of the six bronchitis studies showed that those children and adults who swallowed the herbal extract got rid of their typical bronchitis symptoms (cough, ejection) faster than those subjects who took an active-free sham medication (placebo).', 'In this work, too, the trend was that the extract of the Cape Pelargonia could potentially improve coughing.']",0,"The extract from the root of the Cape geranium (Pelargonium sidoides, Umckaloabo) may potentially reduce typical bronchitis symptoms such as cough and ejection, as suggested by previous studies comparing it to a placebo.",There is evidence of a possible effect in bronchitis. The effectiveness for colds or sinusitis has hardly been researched in reliable studies. It is therefore still an open question whether substances from Cape pelargonium can favorably influence colds and sinusitis.
Can DHEA prolong life or improve health in old age?,"['However, these are not meaningful because they have not investigated aspects that are important in the everyday life of old people – for example, whether DHEA lowers the risk of falls and fractures.', 'However, the results are contradictory and cannot clarify whether the hormone can improve physical performance in old age.', 'In the summary of studies with men, no difference between DHEA and a sham drug emerged [4].', 'We do not know whether DHEA has no effect – or whether an effect has simply not been detected yet.', 'In the event that DHEA should actually have a positive effect: it is not very likely that the hormone will bring a big difference, which will have a significant impact on the daily life of older people.']",1,"The claim is not sufficiently supported by the provided sentences, as they indicate inconsistent results, lack of investigation into relevant aspects for elderly individuals, and suggest that any potential positive effect of DHEA would likely be small and insignificant in their daily lives.",Previous studies show that well-being of body and soul is unlikely to change when older people take DHEA. The same applies to memory and sexual life. Whether DHEA prolongs life or improves health in old age has not yet been scientifically studied.
Do products with the tropical fruit mangosteen promote health?,"['The fact that the mangostan can help with weight loss, however, cannot be derived from any of the three investigations.', 'In summary, we can say whether mangostans in the form of extracts or juices help with weight loss or possibly alleviate the exhaustion of sports, we cannot answer.', 'Mangostane as a drink The study of a mixed drink of mangostane and other fruits as a weight loss aid [4] is also very unreliable.', 'In addition, it remains completely unclear whether the mangostane, another component or a mixture would be responsible for a suspected effect.', 'The fact that this comparison drink was simply diluted with water of mangostan juice and the participants knew about it greatly limits the significance of the results.']",1,"The studies provide no consistent evidence supporting the claim that mangosteen products promote weight loss or alleviate exercise exhaustion, as stated in the claim.","One study has investigated whether a drink containing mangosteen juice alleviates fatigue during exercise.

"Can willow bark tea help with inflammation, pain or fever?","['Only traditions Scientific evidence of whether drinking willow bark tea actually has a pain-relieving, anti-inflammatory or antipyretic effect is missing.', 'There are no well-executed studies comparing the active ingredients of the willow bark with acetylsalicylic acid or other painkillers.', 'It remains completely unclear over which time period and at what dose willow bark tea should be taken.', 'It is of concern that there are no reliable studies on the possible harmful effects of willow bark [1] [4] [5].', 'The authors of both studies came to the conclusion that the study situation on the efficacy of willow bark is completely unclear and that the results of the existing studies do not provide any serious conclusions.']",1,"While willow bark tea has been traditionally used for its pain-relieving, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic effects, there is a lack of scientific evidence and well-designed studies comparing its active ingredients with other painkillers, making it unclear whether it is effective or its potential adverse effects [1] [4] [5].","Significant, well-conducted studies are lacking on the effects of willow bark tea on pain, inflammation, or fever."
"Can a supposedly ""high acid"" diet weaken bones?","['However, a more acidic urine does not say anything about the blood pH, and above all is not related to a possible ""acidification"" of the body, as the representatives of the basic nutrition theory claim.', 'It was shown that a so-called acid-emphasized diet (for example, a high-phosphate, high-protein or high-cereal) has no negative effects on the bones.', 'Although the risk of fractures was not directly investigated, there was no evidence of a decrease in bone density.']",2,"An acid-emphasized diet, including high-phosphate, high-protein, or high-cereal diets, does not negatively affect bones, as shown by the lack of evidence for decreased bone density, despite claims suggesting a potential ""acidification"" of the body.","It is not likely that a supposedly ""acid-rich"" diet weakens the bones. There are no scientific studies on the effect on other diseases."
Is surgery for an anterior cruciate ligament tear (by replacing the broken anterior cruciate ligament with tendon tissue from another part of the leg) followed by physical therapy better than physical therapy alone?,"['Minor differences and later surgery According to the study, both treatment strategies are similarly successful.', 'In the subsequent control tests, patients assessed mobility, pain and resilience in both groups about the same way.']",2,"The study found no significant difference in mobility, pain, or resilience between patients who received surgery and physical therapy versus those who underwent physical therapy alone, which contradicts the claim that surgery followed by physical therapy is better than physical therapy alone.","No differences are found between the two treatment methods after either two or five years. However, this should be viewed with great caution. In a study on this, many patients in the group with physiotherapy had surgery after all within the next five years."
Does treatment according to the fascial distortion model help with chronic shoulder pain?,"['In the study, this form of fascia therapy shows advantages over classic treatment: the mobility of the shoulder is improved more, as is functionality.', 'The most important criterion was how far the mobility of the shoulder can be improved: in the group treated according to fascia distortion model, mobility improved on average in patients by 30 percent in six weeks, in the comparison group only by 15 percent.', 'Participants in the FDM group also performed significantly and clinically relevantly better in terms of functionality and strength.']",0,"The study suggests that treatment according to the fascial distortion model results in greater improvement in shoulder mobility and functionality compared to classic treatment, as evidenced by a 30% improvement in mobility in the FDM group versus 15% in the comparison group, and better performance in terms of functionality and strength in the FDM group.","Currently, there is only one randomized controlled trial of this type of therapy. It suggests that fascia therapy may help with some shoulder conditions."
Does closure of the foramen ovale prevent further strokes in people who have had a stroke of unknown cause?,"['If such patients have a PFO, surgical closure can be used to prevent further strokes.', 'Nevertheless, the data speak for the procedure; thus, even if the cause of the stroke is unknown, the risk of a further stroke can be reduced in at least those people who have an open foramen ovale.', 'All three individual studies provide very similar results and indicate that the closure avoids another stroke rather than just anticoagulant therapy with medications.']",0,"Closure of the foramen ovale can reduce the risk of further strokes in people who have had a stroke of unknown cause and have an open foramen ovale, as suggested by the individual studies indicating that closure avoids another stroke more effectively than anticoagulant therapy with medications.","According to three large studies, closure of the patent foramen ovale can prevent another stroke better than purely drug treatment can."
Do electric toothbrushes protect oral health better than manual brushes?,"['After a thorough analysis of all the results, they have come to a clear conclusion: Yes, electric toothbrushes are actually better for oral hygiene – but the difference is not large [1].', 'The electric oral cleaning thus removes a trace better than hand toothbrushes.', 'If you brush your teeth electrically, you will also get a little less gingival inflammation than people who brush manually, according to the results of the analyzed studies.', 'The advantage of electric toothbrushes compared to conventional toothbrushes is small.']",0,"The first and third sentences provide support for the claim that electric toothbrushes protect oral health better than manual brushes, stating that electric toothbrushes remove traces better and result in less gingival inflammation.",Electric toothbrushes probably combat plaque and bleeding gums slightly better than conventional manual toothbrushes.

Can topiramate reduce the frequency of migraine attacks?,"['The authors summarized the results of 17 studies and found that the number of headaches actually decreases – but only by one in 28 days.', '[1] The overview also shows positive effects on the overall quality of life, but only to a small extent and not quite without contradiction.', 'Although all studies go in the same direction and indicate the effectiveness of topiramate, despite the review work of Cochrane Collaboration, the evidence is low, also because there are other criticisms: The authors have several conflicts of interest and it is possible that studies with poor results have not been published (publication bias).', 'Little knowledge about chronic migraine In the expert recommendation on therapy and care for chronic migraine, two small studies are mentioned, according to which topiramate can also prevent in chronic migraine attacks [2].']",0,"The claim is weakly supported as one study shows a minor decrease in headache frequency, and two small studies suggest effectiveness in chronic migraine, but overall evidence is low due to potential conflicts of interest and publication bias.","Possibly yes. A review by the Cochrane Collaboration attests that topiramate slightly reduces the frequency of migraine attacks in adults, and in some patients the attacks even decrease significantly. Still, there are unanswered questions and the side effects should not be underestimated."
Are there methods that effectively help against hormonal hair loss?,"['The efficacy of the active substance minoxidil is very well secured.', 'Regular use of a 2 or 3% minoxidil solution on the scalp may lead to cosmetically significant improvements in approximately three out of ten men affected [6].', 'Also in women with hormonal hair loss shows the treatment with Minoxidil effect.', 'Also scientifically well documented is the effect of finasteride [1] [2] [4] [5] [6].', 'There is evidence that the active substance can improve hormonal hair loss, as it intervenes in the hormone balance similar to finasteride.']",0,"The claim is supported by the sentences, as they mention scientific documentation of minoxidil's efficacy in treating hormonal hair loss in both men and women, and a second active substance, finasteride, also has well-documented effects.","Besides own hair transplantation, the active substances finasteride or minoxidil (as a solution) can help, but both agents have side effects. The effectiveness of other means is hardly or not secured."
Can Internet-based self-help training based on cognitive behavioral therapy reduce the burden of tinnitus?,"['Accordingly, the authors of a systematic review of Cochrane Collaboration [ 1 ] found strong evidence that cognitive behavioral therapy can lead to a noticeable improvement in the quality of life despite persistent tinnitus.', 'In addition, the therapy can lead to a low relief of depressive moods, which suffer from numerous tinnitus patients.', 'The self-help training developed at Linköping University in Sweden is a version of an already proven cognitive behavioral therapy program for tinnitus patients adapted to the Internet.', 'But also a newly developed Internet program to increase tinnitus acceptance with the help of mindfulness-based strategies proved equally effective.', 'Summary It seems likely that cognitive therapies for tinnitus management not only bring improvement in traditional group sessions, but also in the form of Internet-based self-help training programs.']",0,"The claim is supported by the sentences, as they indicate that cognitive behavioral therapy, whether in traditional group sessions or Internet-based self-help training, can lead to a noticeable improvement in the quality of life for tinnitus patients, and both Linköping University's adapted program and a newly developed mindfulness-based Internet program have proven effective.","Cognitive behavioral therapy can noticeably improve the quality of life and depressiveness of tinnitus sufferers.

Does caffeine make us die sooner???,"['However, this does not yet clarify whether caffeine shortens or prolongs life.', 'This does not mean that it is caffeine that reduces the risk of mortality; it only shows that people who drink a lot of coffee differ in their risk from people who drink little coffee.', 'Why this is so and what role caffeine itself plays is not clarified – even if it could be shown by which mechanisms caffeine may have its positive effect [c].']",1,"The claim that caffeine makes us die sooner is not directly supported or refuted by these sentences, as they discuss the association between coffee consumption and mortality risk, but do not clarify the specific role of caffeine in this relationship.","In moderate amounts, alcohol could reduce the likelihood of dying prematurely. In higher doses, however, it clearly increases this risk. This is unclear for caffeine."
Do earrings cause discomfort by destroying acupuncture points or meridians?,"['However, we could not find any studies that would have investigated earrings and their effects on meridians or acupuncture points.']",1,"The claim cannot be supported or refuted with the given sentences, as there is no available scientific research investigating the relationship between earrings and acupuncture points or meridians.","Earrings very often lead to complications, fortunately most of them are harmless.
