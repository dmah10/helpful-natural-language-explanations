Can masks reduce corona infections when worn by a large proportion of the population?,"['Studies show slow spread After three years of pandemic, there are now relatively meaningful data that masks can slow down the spread of the Corona virus.', 'Surgical masks, in turn, seem to reduce the risk of infecting themselves with the corona virus.']",0,"The first sentence provides evidence that masks can slow down the spread of the Corona virus, supporting the claim that masks can reduce corona infections when worn by a large proportion of the population.","International studies suggest that the number of corona infections decreases when many people wear masks - whether fabric, surgical or FFP2 masks. However, it is not possible to precisely quantify how great the protective effect actually is. It probably depends on the type of masks and the proportion of people who wear them."
Can homeopathic preparations with Anamirta cocculus help against dizziness?,"['But without success: We could not find any meaningful scientific evidence for effectiveness in dizziness.', 'It is now well proven by studies that homeopathic preparations usually do not work better than a sham medication (placebo) [8].', 'However, it is not well established that betahistine is effective against dizziness [11.13].', 'The fact that betahist helps with dizziness is not well documented [11, 13].']",1,"The claim of homeopathic preparations with Anamirta cocculus helping against dizziness is not supported as there is no meaningful scientific evidence of their effectiveness, and they typically do not work better than a placebo.","We have found only one study that has investigated this. However, it is so poor that no reliable statement is possible."
Can zeolite alleviate or prevent health problems?,"['However, none of these can provide any evidence – because the studies have no significance (for reasons see section Studies in detail ).', 'It does not find an advantage for zeolite – but the results are hardly meaningful.', 'However, it is not researched whether the regular intake of zeolite can lead to a nutrient deficiency or has an undesirable effect on digestion.']",1,"The claim that zeolite can alleviate or prevent health problems is not supported by the provided sentences, as there is no significant evidence found in studies and no research on potential nutrient deficiencies or digestive effects due to regular zeolite intake.",Studies to date cannot provide any evidence that taking zeolite prevents or alleviates complaints. A detoxifying effect is not scientifically plausible.
"Does starting school later improve health, learning success, and quality of life in adolescents?","['However, teenagers and parents now have to be very strong: despite 27 studies involving hundreds of thousands of students, no clear results can be derived from research.', 'The problem: The studies usually come to contradictory results.', 'So until better research results are available, all troubled young people and parents will only have the option of remaining out of bed early – or to hope that, despite lack of evidence, the school management will still have an insight into it.', 'It is difficult to examine whether a later start to school will have a positive effect.', 'The Problems: Unknown Influencing Factors: If differences occur in previous-after-studies, these do not have to be due to the later start of school – they may also have been caused by other changes over the course of the study period.']",1,The claim cannot be definitively supported or refuted due to contradictory results from existing studies and the presence of unknown influencing factors.,"The question has been investigated in several large studies. Due to methodological deficiencies and contradictory results, no firm conclusions can be drawn. This means that science can currently neither speak for nor against a benefit of a later school start."
Does the F.X. Mayr cure have health benefits? Can it prevent diseases or treat them?,"['Thus, the claim that the method can help with various diseases is not scientifically justified.', 'These studies cannot answer whether these changes also affect health.', 'Mayr cure or other fasting methods improve health in the long term, however, cannot be concluded.']",1,"The provided sentences offer no scientific evidence to support the claim that the F.X. Mayr cure has health benefits, prevents diseases, or treats them, and they suggest that the long-term health effects of fasting methods like the Mayr cure are inconclusive.","It is neither examined nor proven whether the special fasting method after F.X. Mayr holds, which it promises: Namely assistance with all possible illnesses of allergies, over rheumatism up to sleep disturbances. The advertised detoxification and ""purification"" of the body by the chamfering cure are besides scientifically not plausible."
Does extract from the Damiana plant (Turnera diffusa) help with erectile dysfunction?,"['Efficacy does not appear to have been studied or demonstrated.', 'The studies in detail We could not find any studies on Damiana extract against erectile dysfunction in men.', 'Studies on the product Neradin also appear to be missing.']",1,"The claim cannot be supported since there are no studies demonstrating the efficacy of Damiana extract for erectile dysfunction in men, and studies on the related product Neradin are also missing.","The extract from the Damiana plant (Turnera diffusa) is advertised as a remedy for erectile dysfunction for men. However, this claimed effect on potency is by no means proven. It has apparently never been tested on humans. This also applies to homeopathic remedies such as the product Neradin."
"In everyday life, when breathing with an FFP2 mask or ordinary mouth-nose protection, do you get as much oxygen as without a mask?","['As much oxygen as without a mask This fear is, however, unfounded, as previously conducted studies show [ 1,2 ].', 'Only in very strenuous sports (fast cycling to exhaustion) was the oxygen content in the blood with FFP2 mask slightly lower than without mask.', 'There was no difference in oxygen measurement with ordinary oral nose protection.', 'Breathing a little more strenuous The results thus contradict the rumor that masks would cause an oxygen deficiency.']",0,"The claim is supported by the sentences provided, as previous studies indicate no significant difference in oxygen intake when wearing an FFP2 mask or ordinary mouth-nose protection in everyday life, except for very strenuous sports with the FFP2 mask.","Even if breathing with a mask can feel uncomfortable: According to studies to date, you get just as much oxygen with an FFP2 mask or mouth-nose protection as without a mask. This is true even when you are moving or exerting yourself. Only very intensive sports slightly reduce the oxygen content in the blood - but too little to endanger health."
Do spermidine supplements or a spermidine-rich diet reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia? Do they help with existing dementia?,"['Spermidin studies: not enough as evidence of efficacy Even if both studies had come to overwhelmingly positive results, we would still have concerns about their significance.', 'Spermidine, which is additionally absorbed by food, is not sufficiently researched at the present time.', 'The number of participants is low and the risk is high that the results are not transferable to reality.', 'We do not consider the study to be meaningful.', 'Results: Both the spermidine group and the comparator group had fewer dementia symptoms and better mental performance at the end of the study.']",1,"The claim cannot be supported by the provided sentences, as the studies on spermidine's effects on dementia symptoms have low participant numbers and their results may not be representative of real-world scenarios, while spermidine's role in dementia risk reduction remains insufficiently researched.","Manufacturers of spermidine drugs advertise an alleged positive effect on mental performance and protection against dementia. However, such an effect has not been proven in meaningful studies. We found a single study in which dementia patients had participated. However, their results are not very clear."
Does the pill affect the muscle strength of women??,"['Does the pill also affect muscle strength?', 'The available studies do not provide any indication of such an effect.']",2,The available studies do not suggest that the pill has any effect on women's muscle strength.,"Taking the pill could possibly impair endurance performance in sports somewhat. However, there are no indications of less muscle strength due to the pill. However, these - somewhat contradictory - findings are anything but certain. Whether the somewhat reduced endurance performance speaks against contraception with the pill, each athlete must decide for herself - depending on how important top athletic performance is for her."
Does blood type affect the likelihood that Covid 19 disease will take a severe course or lead to death?,"['Here, the results found seem to contradict the influence of the blood group on the probability of death: the researchers found no connection between certain blood groups and the severity of the disease.', 'Overall, the available data are not meaningful enough to establish or exclude a relationship between the blood group and the course of covid-19 disease.', 'It is certain that no one is protected from a serious Covid-19 history because of their type of blood.', 'No evidence of severe progression in certain blood groups The researchers found no evidence that in the case of a Covid-19 disease, people with a particular blood group need to be treated more frequently in hospital or intensive care units.']",1,"The sentences provide no evidence supporting a relationship between blood type and the severity or likelihood of death from Covid-19, and one statement directly refutes this claim, stating that no one is protected from a serious Covid-19 history because of their blood type.",There is no reliable evidence that people with a certain blood group are more severely affected by covid-19 than those with another. Study results on this are poorly substantiated and partly contradictory.
Do sedatives and sleeping pills such as benzodiazepines and related substances increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease or other forms of dementia?,"['However, it cannot be clearly dispelled by the fact that benzodiazepines and similar substances could promote the development of dementia.']",1,"The sentence suggests a correlation between benzodiazepines and dementia, but it does not provide sufficient evidence to confirm a causative relationship between the two.","A link between the long-term use of sedatives and sleeping pills and the development of dementia cannot be ruled out. However, whether the drugs are the cause of dementia is unclear. Likewise, it is possible that studies show a connection only because people in the undiagnosed early stages of dementia suffer more frequently from sleep disorders or restlessness and therefore take medication against them more often."
Does taking probiotics shorten the duration of acute infectious diarrhea?,"['Thus, at least in children, taking live probiotics is unlikely to affect whether they are still ill after 48 hours.', 'Thus, a probiotic apparently has no clear influence on the resolution of the disease.']",2,"The sentences indicate that probiotics do not have a clear influence on resolving acute infectious diarrhea, which contradicts the claim that probiotics can shorten its duration.","According to current studies, the duration of disease cannot be reduced by taking probiotics. This assessment is reasonably well supported."
Can homeopathic remedies prevent colds in children?,"['Benefits for prevention improbable The conclusion of the review work: Homeopathy is probably not an effective means of preventing colds in children.', 'Children who regularly took homeopathic medicines were not less likely to become ill in the meaningful studies and their colds were not milder.', 'Overall, the studies could not find a preventive effect of homeopathic medicines; they did not reduce the frequency or severity of cold diseases.']",2,The claim is refuted by the sentences as the studies found no preventive effect of homeopathic medicines in reducing the frequency or severity of cold diseases in children.,"Well-conducted studies find neither a preventive nor an alleviating effect of homeopathy on children's colds (chills). However, these studies have examined too few children for a truly conclusive result. Larger studies would be needed for a clear answer.  It is not scientifically plausible that homeopathic remedies are effective."
"Can the Wim Hof method - consisting of breathing training, meditation and acclimatization to cold - strengthen the immune system of healthy people and thus prevent infectious diseases?","['Cold without proven effect for health For none of these promises there is evidence.', 'The study also cannot answer whether trained people reacted less strongly to the bacterial poison than non-trained people – because they lack accurate data.', 'Even if the study had been carried out better, the extent to which this actually brings health benefits such as a reduced risk of infectious diseases is entirely speculative.', 'Even if it were better methodically, it could not answer whether it is the cold that does anything.', 'The cold records from Wim Hof are partly impressive, but whether cold training has a health benefit can not prove this study.']",1,"The study's data does not support the claim that cold training through the Wim Hof method strengthens the immune system and prevents infectious diseases, as it lacks accurate data on comparative reactions to bacterial toxins and cannot prove a health benefit from cold records.","There are individual small studies on the Wim Hof method, but they are poor and inconclusive. Whether the method reduces the probability of infectious diseases has never been researched."
Does thyme help against cough?,"[""We couldn't find a single clinical trial that investigated exclusively thyme for an effect against cough."", 'Conjectures without evidence Although it is not proven that ingredients of the thyme can actually relieve cough, it is also not refuted.', 'However, there is no scientific evidence to date that the mucus solution itself has a relieving or shortening effect on cough [7,8].', 'Therefore, it cannot be said directly whether thyme alone can relieve cough.']",1,"The claim that thyme helps against cough is not directly supported by clinical trials or scientific evidence, and while it's unproven that thyme ingredients relieve cough, there's also no evidence disproving it.",Whether thyme is effective against cough has not yet been researched in meaningful studies.
Is strophanthin an effective cardiovascular drug?,"['Furthermore, the positive results of strophanthin are not credible according to studies.', ""Whether strophanthin relieves symptoms of coronary heart disease or heart failure better than today's standard medications, can therefore not be derived from these studies."", 'Whether strophanthine has a benefit in this respect, the two found studies do not answer.']",1,The two studies mentioned do not provide credible evidence or an answer regarding the effectiveness of strophanthin as a cardiovascular drug compared to standard medications.,"We found two small flawed studies. They only investigated whether complaints improve in the short term, but not the long-term effect on disease progression and deaths. Since the studies are quite old, it is also not possible to assess how strophanthin compares with modern, well-studied drugs."
Is colloidal gold good for health?,"['Apparently, humans have never been investigated whether or which preventive and healing effects could have drinkable gold nanoparticles.', ""The Vienna Environmental Attorney's Office also came to this conclusion: it warned against solutions with silver and gold nanoparticles, as too little is known about their possible harmfulness [5]."", 'Gold against rheumatism A judgment on colloidal gold is therefore not possible due to lack of scientific evidence.', 'Further information We have already reported on the potential benefits and dangers of nanosilver in another article.The studies in detail There are no well-made studies that have investigated the effectiveness of colloidal gold.']",1,The claim that colloidal gold is beneficial for health cannot be substantiated due to the lack of well-designed studies investigating its effectiveness.,"Statements about a possible health benefit of ""drinkable nano gold"" are not possible, because there are no good studies about it. Gold in other forms can help with rheumatism and other diseases, but side effects often occur."
Can acoustic CR ® neuromodulation according to Tass help with tinnitus?,"['Whether the acoustic CR neuromodulation has a positive effect in tinnitus is therefore scientifically unproven (but also not excluded).', 'After both neuromodulation and sham treatment, the participants felt that tinnitus was quieter and less burdensome.', 'Neuromodulation did not appear to be clearly effective.']",1,"The first sentence suggests that the effectiveness of acoustic CR neuromodulation on tinnitus is not scientifically proven, while the second sentence indicates a perceived reduction in tinnitus loudness and burden after both neuromodulation and sham treatment, which does not clearly support the superior effectiveness of neuromodulation.","The only two potentially meaningful studies cannot answer the question. This is because they are small and have serious flaws. A large study intended to show the effectiveness of ""acoustic coordinated reset (CR) neuromodulation"" for tinnitus produced inconclusive results - and was never published. Whether the therapy can help with tinnitus thus remains questionable."
Does ivermectin lower the risk of death in covid-19?,"['According to you, there is no evidence that ivermectin can prevent deaths.', 'However, since there were only 35 deaths in all studies taken together, no reliable conclusions can be drawn for the event outside the studies.']",1,"The claim that ivermectin lowers the risk of death in COVID-19 cannot be supported or refuted due to the limited number of deaths in the studies, preventing the drawing of reliable conclusions for events outside the studies.","Studies to date suggest that ivermectin does not mitigate covid-19. There is also no evidence that the drug can prevent deaths from covid-19. However, a possible beneficial effect cannot be ruled out with certainty either. Larger studies would be needed for this."
"Can budesonide spray inhalation for covid-19 reduce the risk of hospitalization, severe or even fatal outcome?",['It is unclear whether serious patients benefit from budesonide or whether the asthma medication can prevent deaths from Covid-19.'],1,"The sentences provided do not offer information supporting or refuting the claim that budesonide spray inhalation can reduce the risk of hospitalization, severe or fatal outcomes from COVID-19; instead, they indicate uncertainty regarding its benefits for severe patients and its ability to prevent deaths from the disease.","In mild covid-19 disease, the cortisone preparation budesonide may be able to alleviate symptoms somewhat and make patients feel better more quickly. However, these results are not well established. The study results available to date cannot reliably answer the question of whether patients with budesonide also need to be hospitalized less often. It is also unclear whether budesonide can also help severely ill patients or prevent deaths caused by Covid-19."
Does a nasal spray with carrageenan from red algae prevent infection with coronavirus? Can it alleviate a covid 19 disease that has already broken out?,"['It is therefore unclear whether a nasal spray with carrages from red algae can protect against infection with the corona virus.', 'For several reasons, however, we cannot deduce that the Carrageen spray protects against a corona infection: For us, it was not comprehensible.', 'Treatment Covid-19 For the (supporting) treatment of Covid-19 with a carragen spray from red algae, we have not found any studies.']",1,"The claim that a nasal spray with carrageenan from red algae prevents infection with the coronavirus or alleviates Covid-19 is not supported by the provided sentences, which mention a lack of clarity and understanding regarding the spray's ability to protect against coronavirus infection and the absence of studies on its use for treating Covid-19.","Whether such a spray can in principle protect against infection with the coronavirus has not yet been researched. Studies exist only on the treatment of Covid-19, but these are grossly deficient and therefore inconclusive."
Are rapid antigen tests as reliable as slower PCR tests? Does a negative (inconspicuous) rapid test result reliably exclude an infection with the coronavirus?,"['A negative test result is also only a snapshot: Even if the antigen test is inconspicuous, you can already have infected yourself, and the test might be positive the following day.', 'Rapid tests do not allow the corona virus to be detected in as small quantities as PCR tests.', 'PCR tests are also not infallible, but they are currently considered the most reliable method of detecting infection with SARS-CoV-2.']",2,"While rapid tests may not detect the coronavirus in as small quantities as PCR tests and a negative result only represents a snapshot, PCR tests are currently considered the most reliable method for detecting infection with SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that rapid tests may not be as reliable.","Rapid antigen tests are more flexible and faster than PCR tests. However, the reliability of rapid antigen tests depends heavily on the timing of the test: the tests are most reliable when the first symptoms appear. Rapid antigen tests do not come close to the reliability of longer PCR tests."
Can lung cancer screening by computed tomography (CT) also do harm???,"[""So Salopp's wording is unclear whether people with screening are less likely to die of lung cancer, but they may be ill in the rest of their lives, for example through stressful treatments."", 'Also consider disadvantages The probable, but rather small use of the screening is opposed to some disadvantages: False alarms are likely to occur among 1 to 15 out of 1000 participants in the screening group.', 'Up to 22 out of 1000 screened people are expected to be diagnosed with ""overdiagnoses"" – lung cancer, which would not have been detected without screening, because it does not cause any symptoms throughout the life.', 'Another reason not to screen further: if another disease occurs, which probably significantly shortens the lifespan or leads to the patient being unable to operate on the lungs for cancer treatment [6].']",0,"The claim does not specify whether it is referring to the risk of dying from lung cancer, but the sentences mention potential harms such as false alarms, overdiagnoses, and the possibility of not being able to treat lung cancer if another disease is present, suggesting that lung cancer screening by CT can indeed cause harm.","Screening in the high-risk group likely prevents deaths from lung cancer. Whether the screened individuals actually live longer and have a higher quality of life is not clear. There are also risks: On the one hand, some screened individuals receive a diagnosis of lung cancer but would not have experienced symptoms during their lifetime. Furthermore, a small proportion of screened individuals must expect a false-positive result (""false alarm""). Until the all-clear is given, interventions are necessary for clarification, during which complications can occur."
Does gargling with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) help against coronavirus or others in throat infections?,"['We could not find studies on gurgling with hydrogen peroxide to prevent or treat infections in the throat room.', 'However, it is not plausible that gurgling with hydrogen peroxide can protect against infections with the corona virus.', 'Equally unexplored and questionable is whether hydrogen peroxide is suitable for the treatment of coronavirus infection.', 'It is also one of the natural defense mechanisms with which the body fights against bacteria and viruses [2].The studies in detail In spite of intensive research, we received no answers to the question whether hydrogen peroxide as a Gurgel solution can prevent or combat infections in the throat area.']",1,"The claim cannot be supported or refuted with the given sentences, as there is no available research or evidence indicating that gargling with hydrogen peroxide can prevent or treat coronavirus or throat infections.","Whether hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as a gargle solution is suitable to treat or prevent COVID-19, sore throats or colds has never been scientifically studied. Neither has whether regular use is harmful. However, if hydrogen peroxide is swallowed or inhaled, there may be health consequences."
Does vitamin D prevent covid-19 disease? Does vitamin D mitigate the course of Covid 19 disease?,"[""But they can't give answers – for example, if the person with vitamin D is better after four weeks than without extra vitamin D. It is also unclear whether the treatment can prevent deaths."", 'Whether the intake of vitamin D reduces the risk of disease in these people cannot be answered by the observational studies.', 'But in vain, no preventive studies on vitamin D and corona appear to have been published.']",1,"The observational studies do not provide a clear answer on whether vitamin D reduces the risk of Covid-19 disease or prevents deaths, and no preventive studies on vitamin D and corona have been published.",Studies to date on the treatment of covid-19 cannot answer whether vitamin D can alleviate the disease. No studies have yet been published on a possible preventive effect.
Does vitamin B3 protect against severe covid-19 events?,"['Why such studies from the perspective of some experts seem promising at all, however, does not make us quite clear: because the reasons for the planned studies cite almost exclusively possible mechanisms of action at cell level, not even animal experiments with vitamin B3.', 'Whether vitamin B3 helps to prevent severe Covid-19 processes remains to be seen.', 'This vitamin deficiency disease can alter the skin and mucous membranes, but can also cause neurological disorders [3].The studies in detail For the benefit of vitamin B3 in Covid-19, we have not found completed meaningful studies.', 'Based on these very preliminary (and usually not used by us) sources, we believe that we can identify potential weaknesses of the study: In this way, two treatments with unknown effects are tested and compared within the study: We do not know whether they help from vitamin B3 or from silica.']",1,"The claim that vitamin B3 protects against severe Covid-19 events is not supported by completed meaningful studies or animal experiments, as mentioned in the sentences.",We could not find any completed meaningful studies on this topic. Two ongoing studies are currently investigating the question.
Does ozonated vegetable oil help against vaginal fungus??,"['However, only with little success: For internal use (drips for swallowing) of ozonated vegetable oils we could not find any studies that are at least reasonably meaningful.', 'The question whether ozonated oils help at least as well with various fungal infections as conventional drugs cannot be answered for us.', 'For us, however, this is no evidence that ozonated oil is a good alternative to conventional anti-fungal agents.']",1,"The claim that ozonated vegetable oil helps against vaginal fungus is not supported by any meaningful studies for internal use, and there is no evidence that it is as effective as conventional drugs, leaving the question unanswered.",We could not find any studies on these questions that we considered trustworthy.
Does melatonin help against jet lag?,"['Overall, the studies show that melatonin may help better against jetlag than a sham drug.', 'Reliable statements on side effects of melatonin cannot be made on the basis of the studies.', 'Difficult Summary In the systematic review work [1] four studies with a total of around 140 participants could be combined mathematically: According to this, people with melatonin have less jet-lag complaints than people who took a placebo.']",0,"The systematic review of four studies suggests that people who take melatonin experience fewer jet-lag complaints than those who take a placebo, implying that melatonin may help against jet lag.","The best available studies suggest that melatonin may be effective against jet lag problems. However, this assessment is not well supported."
Does discontinuation of denosumab increase the risk of vertebral fractures???,"['The consequences of discontinuation of denosumab are insufficiently investigated.', 'However, it is unclear whether discontinuation actually leads to more bone fractures.', 'Therefore, no reliable statements can be made from the data as to whether the discontinuation of denosumab leads to bone fractures.']",1,The impact of denosumab discontinuation on vertebral fractures remains uncertain due to insufficient investigation and unclear evidence linking discontinuation to increased fractures.,The pooled results of studies to date show that denosumab reduces the risk of vertebral fractures more than a placebo. It may even be slightly more protective than single other osteoporosis drugs.  It cannot be ruled out that discontinuing denosumab increases the likelihood of vertebral fractures again. The studies on this are contradictory.
Does deuterium-reduced water improve disease progression in cancer???,"['The theoretical considerations for this have not necessarily convinced us: Laboratory and animal tests are reported on websites as an argument for deuterium-reduced water.', ""Unreliable For patients with prostate cancer, a benefit of deuterium-reduced water cannot be safely demonstrated with the study found, even if the author's team reports otherwise."", 'At least in our review, we came to the conclusion that there is no clear difference in mortality between the two groups, with a more appropriate method from our point of view.']",1,"The claim that deuterium-reduced water improves disease progression in cancer is not clearly supported by the provided sentences, as a review of studies found no significant difference in mortality between the two groups, and patient benefits cannot be safely demonstrated for prostate cancer patients.","We found only one study with prostate cancer patients comparing deuterium-reduced water with normal water. This small study has numerous flaws, so the results are not conclusive. We were unable to locate reliable studies on its use in other cancers or for cancer prevention."
Does therapeutic dancing help people with Parkinson's improve their movement problems?,"[""Small improvements – perhaps In fact, the summarized results of previous studies suggest that dancing can help with Parkinson's disease – at least a little [1]."", 'Compared to no therapy, dancing improved movement restrictions by around 8 points on this scale.', 'Compared to exercise therapy, dancing improved movement restrictions by around 2 points on this scale.']",0,"The summarized results of previous studies suggest that dancing can provide small improvements in movement restrictions for people with Parkinson's disease when compared to no therapy, but the improvement is less than when compared to exercise therapy.","Dancing could somewhat improve the movement problems of affected people. It is also possible that dancing performs slightly better compared to other movement exercises. Nevertheless, it does not seem to increase the quality of life noticeably."
Is it possible to reliably detect coronavirus infection based only on symptoms but without laboratory testing?,"['However, it appears that symptoms alone are not sufficient to reliably diagnose symptoms.', 'Neither the presence of certain symptoms nor their absence makes it possible to conclude with high certainty on Covid-19 or to exclude the infection.', 'At least at the moment, symptoms can only provide evidence that a more accurate investigation by means of a laboratory test is important.']",2,"The sentences indicate that symptoms cannot conclusively diagnose or rule out Covid-19, making it necessary for laboratory testing to confirm infection.","So far, no symptoms have emerged from which a covid 19 infection can be inferred with certainty. The absence of certain symptoms also does not allow an all-clear to be given. Thus, it appears that symptoms such as coughing, shortness of breath or loss of smell are not suitable for making a diagnosis. Laboratory tests (""PCR tests"") are currently the safest option (as of August 2020)."
Are home coronavirus self-tests as reliable as tests performed by trained healthcare professionals?,"['Do-it-yourself tests: Study situation thin We could not find any studies that investigated how reliable Corona self-tests are for home compared to professionally performed tests.', ""Whether the do-it-yourself variant of the Corona test is just as good as the professionally performed test directly in the laboratory or the doctor's office, therefore remains unexplained."", 'In this case, the test should be repeated approximately one or two days later [5].The studies in detail We could not find any studies on how reliable self-tests for home can detect an infection with the new Coronavirus – compared to a test by professionals.']",1,"The claim cannot be confirmed or refuted with the given sentences, as there is no available research comparing the reliability of home coronavirus self-tests to those performed by professionals.","Whether self-tests from the drugstore or pharmacy provide as reliable results as a test by trained health personnel has not yet been investigated. Errors are possible when taking the sample at home. Things can also go wrong in transit to the laboratory. This can affect the accuracy of the test result.

"Does taking supplements with omega-3 fatty acids reduce the risk of heart attack, stroke or other sudden cardiovascular problems?  Does it lower the risk of dying prematurely?","['Individuals who had taken additional omega-3 fatty acids suffered a heart attack, stroke or similar acute illness as those who had taken a dummy preparation (placebo) in the course of the study.', 'Omega-3 fatty acids: without effect on the heart and vessels In the summary, the studies showed that omega-3 fatty acids have no influence on the risk of premature death.', 'Also, the intake of additional omega-3 fatty acids did not seem to be able to prolong life.']",2,"The studies provide no evidence that omega-3 fatty acids reduce the risk of heart attack, stroke, or other sudden cardiovascular problems, or lower the risk of premature death, as individuals taking omega-3 fatty acids showed similar outcomes to those taking a placebo.",The summarized results of studies to date clearly show that dietary supplements with omega-3 fatty acids do not protect against acute cardiovascular diseases such as heart attack or stroke. The same applies to diets particularly rich in omega-3s.  Additional omega-3 fatty acids also cannot reduce the general risk of premature death.

Do preparations with unsaponifiable components of avocado and soybean oils (ASU) help against limitations and pain in osteoarthritis of the hip joint?,"['In contrast, the participants were not better off with a hip arthritis.', 'This obviously does not apply to arthrosis in the hip joint.', 'The ASU preparations apparently do not relieve pain and movement restrictions under these conditions.']",2,"The sentences provided do not support the claim that ASU preparations alleviate pain and movement restrictions in osteoarthritis of the hip joint, as they indicate no improvement for hip arthritis and no relief of symptoms under certain conditions.",There is evidence of minor efficacy of preparations containing avocado and soybean oil (ASU). They can probably somewhat alleviate movement restrictions and pain in osteoarthritis of the knee joint - at least in the short term. An effect in osteoarthritis of the hip joint has not yet been shown. Side effects are not to be expected.
Can taking chondroitin relieve osteoarthritis pain or improve mobility in the long term?,"['However, studies so far probably do not indicate that chondroitin can help people with osteoarthritis.', 'The combined research results [1-9] show that chondroitin intake probably does not improve pain or mobility.', 'However, the summarized results of previous studies show that also the combination of chondroitin and glucosamine may not relieve symptoms of osteoarthritis [1,4,6,7,9].', 'The result is similar in all nine cases: a noticeable improvement of the symptoms due to chondroitin is unlikely.']",2,"The consensus of multiple studies indicates that chondroitin is unlikely to alleviate pain or improve mobility in individuals with osteoarthritis, and the combination of chondroitin and glucosamine also shows no significant symptom relief.","In the studies conducted to date, chondroitin did not lead to any noticeable overall improvement in the symptoms of osteoarthritis. However, the results differ from one another in some cases. This limits their significance somewhat."
Can disinfectants containing highly diluted sodium hypochlorite (below 0.1%) render corona and other viruses harmless and thus protect against infection?,"['Evidence that sodium hypochlorite frees hands from disease-causing viruses is missing.', 'Skin effect unclear It is therefore unclear whether a disinfectant with less than 0.1% sodium hypochlorite is strong enough to reliably eliminate viruses.', 'So it is quite questionable whether sodium hypochlorite on the hands unfolds its anti-virus effect as well as on clean steel.', 'However, it remains unclear whether highly diluted sodium hypochlorite solutions are still sufficiently strong against viruses.', 'The studies in detail We could not find any studies that investigated the effect of solutions with sodium hypochlorite or electrolytically activated water on hand disinfection against corona and other viruses.']",1,"The claim's validity cannot be determined based on the provided sentences, as there is no evidence or studies indicating that highly diluted sodium hypochlorite solutions can effectively eliminate corona and other viruses on hands.","Whether disinfectants containing sodium hypochlorite reliably rid hands of viruses has never been investigated in scientific studies.

Does ACE inhibitors like ramipril increase the risk of lung cancer?,"['Contradictory results Previous studies also had problems in providing a clear answer.', 'The research has produced contradictory results: in some cases, the risk of lung cancer was increased with ACE inhibitors, decreased or not altered in others.', 'Therefore, it is not certain whether the relationship found is really due to the ACE inhibitors.']",1,"While some studies suggest a link between ACE inhibitors like ramipril and lung cancer risk, others do not, making it unclear whether any relationship is truly caused by the ACE inhibitors.","A large observational study has found an increased risk of lung cancer with long-term use of ACE inhibitors compared with another group of antihypertensive drugs. However, other causes for this association cannot be completely ruled out. Previous studies have reached inconsistent results. Therefore, it can currently neither be confirmed nor ruled out that the risk of lung cancer may increase with ACE inhibitors. Even if further studies should really confirm the increased risk, the effect is likely to be rather small."

Does the active ingredient rivaroxaban (drug Xarelto) have a higher risk of dangerous bleeding than other anticoagulants?,"['A summary analysis of studies published so far on rivaroxaban in particular also finds overall less fatal bleeding than in the use of vitamin K antagonists (cumarine) [4], although there has been no overall difference in the number of premature deaths.', 'The comparison of rivaroxaban with other factor Xa inhibitors shows only very small differences: According to a recent summary of several meta-analyses, the active substance of Xarelto does not perform best, but the result is uncertain.', 'Overall, these drugs have the same effect as the older vitamin K antagonist treatment, but with a significantly lower risk of bleeding – the risk is almost halved.', 'According to this, the new drugs avoid strokes more effectively than the older ones, with regard to the risk of bleeding there is no difference.']",2,"The active ingredient rivaroxaban (Xarelto) does not have a higher risk of dangerous bleeding compared to other anticoagulants, as summarized studies show no significant difference in bleeding risk or premature deaths between rivaroxaban and vitamin K antagonists or other factor Xa inhibitors.","High-quality studies in the most common uses of rivaroxaban show either an equal or even lower risk of bleeding than other blood-clotting medications. However, this does not mean it is the best choice in all cases. Research is still needed for bleeding in the stomach or intestines."
Are Vemma products good for health?,"['Quickly clarified There is no reason to believe that Vemma products have any health benefits; according to our research, they were only once the subject of a medical study – which, however, is completely unusable due to serious defects [1] Vemma, on the other hand, was often the subject of investigations, since the distribution system is very reminiscent of a pyramid game [b] [c].', 'However, the results are worthless for several reasons: there is no information on how the random assignment to the trial or placebo group happened, whether the blinding has kept, whether and how a blinding of the treating physicians has happened at all, the results contradict text and graphics and in the statistical analysis also serious errors have been made [1].']",1,"The claim that Vemma products are good for health is not supported by the information that only one medical study existed, which is unusable due to serious defects, and Vemma has been often investigated for its distribution system resembling a pyramid scheme.","We have found only one study that investigates health effects of Vemma. However, the study is so flawed that it does not allow us to draw any conclusions."
Can FLEXISEQ ointment relieve osteoarthritis pain?,"[""So the ointment FLEXISEQ would have to be compared to a placebo ointment – that hasn't happened yet; compared to a medication to be swallowed, a placebo to be swallowed, and an ointment with an active substance, but its effectiveness itself is not too clear."", 'So it is not sure whether the ointment helps better than a suitable placebo.', 'The study duration in the four individual studies described is a maximum of 12 weeks, so long-term effects have not yet been investigated.']",1,"While there have been studies on FLEXISEQ ointment, they do not clearly demonstrate its superiority over a suitable placebo in relieving osteoarthritis pain, and long-term effects remain unexplored.",Comparisons to date with other commonly used treatments are difficult to interpret but do not yield clear evidence of efficacy.
Can butterbur prevent migraine attacks?,"['In summary, both studies show that it is twice as likely that the number of migraine attacks will halve after twelve weeks with the Pestwurz preparation compared to a dummy medication.', 'The above overviews are of different quality, but all come to the same conclusions due to the two same studies: Pestwurz can reduce the number of migraine attacks for some patients.']",0,"The two studies, though of varying quality, consistently conclude that butterbur, or Pestwurz, can reduce the frequency of migraine attacks for some patients.","Two well-done randomized-controlled trials show efficacy - the number of migraine attacks can probably be reduced with butterbur. Even if the effect is not huge, taking it may be worthwhile due to only minor side effects."
Do vitamin E supplements increase the likelihood of early death?,"['The result: more deaths occur in the vitamin E group than in the comparison group without vitamin supplements.', 'This meta-analysis also results in a slightly increased number of deaths due to vitamin E preparations.', 'This calculates an increased risk of premature death in vitamin E intake by three percent [2].']",0,"The provided sentences offer evidence that vitamin E supplements may be associated with a slight increase in mortality, as stated in the claim, but they do not explicitly confirm a three percent increased risk of premature death.","Studies on this topic are very inconsistent. Nevertheless, there is a possibility that vitamin E increases the risk of death. A meta-analysis warns against high-dose vitamin preparations."
Does less than 7h of sleep daily increase mental performance?,"['Already six hours of sleep reduce brain performance The results of a small randomized-controlled study [1] clearly contradict the claim of performance-enhancing sleep loss.', 'After only a few nights it became apparent: the shorter the participants could sleep at night, the worse they did in the tests compared to the group with eight hours of sleep.', 'The performance of the sleep deficit group was significantly worse after five days compared to the control group, although the impact is limited by the small size of the control group.', 'This shows that lack of sleep actually seemed to be the cause of the worse mental performance.', 'Overall, if you sleep only six or less hours per night, you will hardly be wiser, but it seems to impair your mental performance.']",2,"The sentences provide evidence that less than 7h of sleep daily decreases mental performance, contradicting the claim.",Two small randomized-controlled studies indicate that mental performance decreases with the number of sleepless hours per night and the number of nights with insufficient sleep.

Do frequent ejaculations have a protective effect against prostate cancer?,"['Result: Men with frequent ejaculations between 20 and 30 years of age have a one-third reduced prostate cancer risk compared to those with rare ejaculations [1].', ""Taking the result seriously, it doesn't show that much self-satisfaction protects, but rather that men with very few ejaculations could have a slightly higher risk of prostate cancer."", 'Here it turns out that frequent ejaculations from the age of four years onwards or over the entire life span may reduce the risk of prostate cancer [3].', 'In sum, the study provides evidence that with increasing ejaculation frequency, the risk of prostate cancer could actually decrease.']",0,"The claim is partially supported by the evidence, as some studies suggest a decrease in prostate cancer risk with increasing ejaculation frequency from an early age or over the entire lifespan, but the protective effect is not explicitly attributed to frequent self-satisfaction.","A cohort study suggests that more frequent ejaculations starting at age 40, or over a lifetime, could potentially lower the risk of prostate cancer. This is not exclusive to ejaculations from masturbation, but from any sexual activity."
Do today's children have a shorter life expectancy than their parents?,"['Overweight leads to a higher rate of premature deaths – which reduces life expectancy on average by 3 to 9 months.', 'So it would be a reversal of the trend: for the first time in a long time, children would have a life expectancy less than their parents.', 'There are some reasons to assume that it will be worse than the 3 to 9 months less: Obesity is becoming more common and occurs in increasingly younger children [1].', 'If this trend continues, there may be a reduction in life expectancy of three to five years.']",0,"While overweight is associated with a higher rate of premature deaths and obesity is becoming more prevalent in younger children, current data does not support a reduction in life expectancy of three to five years for today's children compared to their parents.","Obesity and physical inactivity are increasing risk factors worldwide that can shorten life. In 2005, a study from the USA concluded that life expectancy could be reduced by 3 to 9 months when these risks were included."
Does training on vibration platforms cause a noticeable buildup of muscle strength?,"['Therefore, training on vibration platforms could actually strengthen the muscle strength of the leg muscles.', 'However, compared to conventional strengthening training, the results do not indicate superiority of vibration platforms.', 'According to the results of this study, it could be concluded at most that training on a vibration platform in combination with a diet can lead to weight loss, which could also be achieved by a conventional fitness program or a mere diet without exercise program.']",0,"While training on vibration platforms may strengthen leg muscles to some extent, there is no evidence suggesting it is more effective than conventional strengthening training, and its primary benefit seems to be weight loss when combined with a diet, which can also be achieved through conventional fitness programs or diets without exercise.","Vibration training may be helpful for building muscle strength in the legs, but it is not better than conventional training for this purpose. Whether the method is also suitable for weight reduction has not been sufficiently studied."
Do generic drugs work as well as original drugs?,"['Results & Interpretation In a review of 7 individual studies [1] published in 2010, three active substances against epilepsy were compared with generic drugs, with no evidence of an increased probability of seizures.', 'For none of the active substances studied, there was evidence of a lower efficacy of the generic medicinal product.', 'Based on the studies published so far, there is no evidence of inferiority of generic medicinal products compared to original medicinal products.']",0,"Based on the review of seven studies, there is no evidence to suggest that generic drugs are less effective than original drugs in treating epilepsy, and some studies even indicate similar efficacy.","Yes, the summarized results of clinical studies do not provide any evidence for a poorer efficacy of generics compared to originator drugs. However, comparative studies exist only for some agents against cardiovascular diseases and epilepsy."
Does UV light reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease?,"['The result: 20 minutes under artificial UVA light may reduce blood pressure slightly in the short term.', 'Whether regular UVA irradiation can also reduce blood pressure in the long term cannot be predicted from this, longer-term studies would be necessary.', 'Cardiovascular diseases vs. cancer Overall, the evidence for reducing the heart risk from sunbathing is still insufficient – only more extensive and more precise studies can give an answer.']",1,"While a single exposure to artificial UVA light may temporarily reduce blood pressure, there is currently not enough evidence to predict whether regular UVA irradiation would have long-term effects on blood pressure or overall cardiovascular disease risk.","It is theoretically conceivable that UVB light could reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. However, studies published so far cannot sufficiently confirm this assumption."
Does the use of laptops with active WLAN (wireless internet access) affect sperm quality in men?,"['However, no such or similar study has been carried out so far – therefore, there is currently no indication for a sperm-damaging effect of WLAN radiation.', 'Conclusion Even though the Argentinean researchers were aware of the heat development by laptops in their WLAN examination and kept the temperature of sperm samples in their glass bowls constantly low – there is no direct evidence of the acute threat to male fertility from the use of laptops – with or without WLAN.']",1,"While the Argentinean study kept sperm sample temperatures low during WLAN examination, it provides no direct evidence of an acute threat to male fertility from laptop use, with or without WLAN, leaving uncertainty about sperm-damaging effects.","The underlying study is not sufficiently conclusive to be able to determine such an effect.

Do milk or dairy products promote prostate cancer?,"['Intestinal cancer and bladder cancer risk reduced For some types of cancer, the consumption of large amounts of milk and dairy products seems to be able to reduce the risk of cancer.', 'Men who claimed to have consumed a great deal of milk and dairy products have, over the years, been less likely to have these types of cancer than men who had little milk-containing food.', 'At least for cancer in the colon and the rectum, the results show a direct connection with the amount of milk product: the more milk and dairy products the study participants consumed, the greater the protection effect.', 'A potentially increased prostate risk due to very high milk and dairy consumption is thus opposed to a likely reduction in the risk of colorectal cancer.', 'There is also the possibility that dairy products will reduce the likelihood of bladder cancer.']",0,"While some studies indicate that milk and dairy products may reduce the risk of certain cancers, such as intestinal, bladder, and colorectal cancer, no direct connection is mentioned between these products and a reduced risk of prostate cancer.","It is likely that dairy products reduce the risk of colon and rectal cancer, and possibly bladder cancer. However, very large amounts of milk & dairy products could possibly increase the risk of prostate cancer. It should be remembered that about the same number of men die from colon and rectal cancer as from prostate cancer. For breast and ovarian cancer and cancer of the endometrium, it is unclear whether cancer risk is affected by milk and dairy products."
Can arthroscopy reduce pain or improve mobility?,"['Studies clearly speak against a benefit A research team summarized the most meaningful of all previously published studies on arthroscopy in knee arthritis.', 'In these studies, patients treated after arthroscopy had no noticeably less pain or movement restrictions than those treated only for appearance or not at all.', 'Arthroscopy against osteoarthritis: not effective, but also not very risky After all: Undesirable events were not conspicuously common in the arthroscopy groups either.']",2,"The claim is refuted by the sentences provided, as multiple studies show that arthroscopy does not result in less pain or improved mobility for patients with knee arthritis, and any adverse events were not particularly common in the arthroscopy groups.",The data are clear: Arthroscopy is useless as a treatment for knee osteoarthritis. It can neither relieve pain nor improve the function of the knee joint in the long term.
Do health benefits increase with duration and intensity of exercise?,"['==References==<br> According to their calculations, 75 minutes of brisk walking a week can extend life by 1.8 years.', 'In both normal and overweight people, mortality decreased when the researchers compared slightly active (equivalent to approximately 140 minutes of brisk walking per week) with inactive people.', 'In this study, too, a gain in years of life was calculated, but here in relation to the time of birth: Compared to inactive people, slight activity prolongs life by 0.7 years.', '150 minutes of physical activity per week reduced mortality by around 9 percent.', 'less than 150 minutes per week, can reduce their risk of death by around 34% compared to inactive people.']",0,"The sentences provide evidence that increased duration and intensity of exercise can lead to a decrease in mortality and an extension of life, supporting the claim.","Several major studies have consistently concluded that physical activity reduces mortality. Even a brisk walk is enough. More helps more - but in any case, some exercise is much better than none at all."
