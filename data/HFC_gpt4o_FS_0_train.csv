Can masks reduce corona infections when worn by a large proportion of the population?,"['Studies show slow spread After three years of pandemic, there are now relatively meaningful data that masks can slow down the spread of the Corona virus.', 'Surgical masks, in turn, seem to reduce the risk of infecting themselves with the corona virus.']",0,"Studies indicate that masks can slow the spread of the coronavirus, suggesting that widespread mask usage may help reduce infections in the population.","International studies suggest that the number of corona infections decreases when many people wear masks - whether fabric, surgical or FFP2 masks. However, it is not possible to precisely quantify how great the protective effect actually is. It probably depends on the type of masks and the proportion of people who wear them."
Can homeopathic preparations with Anamirta cocculus help against dizziness?,"['But without success: We could not find any meaningful scientific evidence for effectiveness in dizziness.', 'It is now well proven by studies that homeopathic preparations usually do not work better than a sham medication (placebo) [8].', 'However, it is not well established that betahistine is effective against dizziness [11.13].', 'The fact that betahist helps with dizziness is not well documented [11, 13].']",1,"No meaningful scientific evidence supports the effectiveness of homeopathic preparations, including Anamirta cocculus, for treating dizziness.","We have found only one study that has investigated this. However, it is so poor that no reliable statement is possible."
Can zeolite alleviate or prevent health problems?,"['However, none of these can provide any evidence – because the studies have no significance (for reasons see section Studies in detail ).', 'It does not find an advantage for zeolite – but the results are hardly meaningful.', 'However, it is not researched whether the regular intake of zeolite can lead to a nutrient deficiency or has an undesirable effect on digestion.']",1,"The sentences indicate a lack of significant evidence regarding the benefits of zeolite for health problems, and they also raise concerns about potential negative effects from its regular intake.",Studies to date cannot provide any evidence that taking zeolite prevents or alleviates complaints. A detoxifying effect is not scientifically plausible.
"Does starting school later improve health, learning success, and quality of life in adolescents?","['However, teenagers and parents now have to be very strong: despite 27 studies involving hundreds of thousands of students, no clear results can be derived from research.', 'The problem: The studies usually come to contradictory results.', 'So until better research results are available, all troubled young people and parents will only have the option of remaining out of bed early – or to hope that, despite lack of evidence, the school management will still have an insight into it.', 'It is difficult to examine whether a later start to school will have a positive effect.', 'The Problems: Unknown Influencing Factors: If differences occur in previous-after-studies, these do not have to be due to the later start of school – they may also have been caused by other changes over the course of the study period.']",1,"The existing studies on starting school later yield contradictory results, making it difficult to determine any positive effects on health, learning success, or quality of life in adolescents.","The question has been investigated in several large studies. Due to methodological deficiencies and contradictory results, no firm conclusions can be drawn. This means that science can currently neither speak for nor against a benefit of a later school start."
Does the F.X. Mayr cure have health benefits? Can it prevent diseases or treat them?,"['Thus, the claim that the method can help with various diseases is not scientifically justified.', 'These studies cannot answer whether these changes also affect health.', 'Mayr cure or other fasting methods improve health in the long term, however, cannot be concluded.']",1,"The sentences indicate that there is no scientific justification for the claim that the F.X. Mayr cure can help with various diseases, and they suggest that the long-term health benefits of such methods cannot be conclusively established.","It is neither examined nor proven whether the special fasting method after F.X. Mayr holds, which it promises: Namely assistance with all possible illnesses of allergies, over rheumatism up to sleep disturbances. The advertised detoxification and ""purification"" of the body by the chamfering cure are besides scientifically not plausible."
Does extract from the Damiana plant (Turnera diffusa) help with erectile dysfunction?,"['Efficacy does not appear to have been studied or demonstrated.', 'The studies in detail We could not find any studies on Damiana extract against erectile dysfunction in men.', 'Studies on the product Neradin also appear to be missing.']",1,The lack of studies specifically examining the effects of Damiana extract on erectile dysfunction indicates that there is insufficient information to support the claim.,"The extract from the Damiana plant (Turnera diffusa) is advertised as a remedy for erectile dysfunction for men. However, this claimed effect on potency is by no means proven. It has apparently never been tested on humans. This also applies to homeopathic remedies such as the product Neradin."
Is the homeopathic remedy Neradin effective for erectile dysfunction?,"['No studies on Neradin Also our search for studies on the product Neradin remained resultless.', 'Studies on the product Neradin also appear to be missing.']",1,The absence of studies on the homeopathic remedy Neradin indicates that there is no available evidence to assess its effectiveness for erectile dysfunction.,"The extract from the Damiana plant (Turnera diffusa) is advertised as a remedy for erectile dysfunction for men. However, this claimed effect on potency is by no means proven. It has apparently never been tested on humans. This also applies to homeopathic remedies such as the product Neradin."
Can monk's pepper reduce PMS symptoms? PMS is the abbreviation for premenstrual syndrome. This refers to complaints that occur in the days before menstruation.,"['Reference to efficacy in PMS According to previous studies, monk peppers could actually help in PMS.', 'The summarized study results indicate that the symptoms with monk pepper are reduced in more patients than with a sham medication (placebo).', 'Therefore, it would be possible for monk peppers to act against PMS symptoms such as breast spacing.']",0,"Monk peppers have been shown in previous studies to potentially alleviate PMS symptoms more effectively than a placebo, suggesting a possible benefit for those experiencing premenstrual syndrome.","In the studies to date, monk's pepper seems to relieve PMS symptoms better than a placebo. However, this is not well proven, because the studies have significant weaknesses. There is no evidence of an effect on menstrual disorders. Significant studies are lacking."
Can probiotics lower blood sugar in type 2 diabetes?,"['And if so, can probiotics reverse this change and reduce blood sugar levels again?', 'At the most small effect, they may actually be able to.', 'However, the effect of the capsules and tablets does not seem to be large: in the previous studies, they were able to reduce the long-term sugar level HbA1c by an average of 0.55 points.']",0,"Probiotics may have a small effect on lowering blood sugar levels in type 2 diabetes, as indicated by a modest reduction in the long-term sugar level HbA1c in previous studies, but the overall impact appears to be limited.","The summarized results of studies to date suggest that probiotics in capsule or tablet form could lower blood sugar somewhat. At least if they are taken over a period of two to three months. However, the effect is not well established. Probiotic dairy products and probiotic powder for dissolving do not seem to have any demonstrable effect."
Can the so-called Tupler technique help against rectus diastasis?,"['No studies on the Tupler technique As intense as we were looking for, we could not find the promised studies on the Tupler technique.', 'The claim that this is a scientifically proven therapy for rectus diastase is therefore simply wrong.', 'The studies in detail We did not find any studies that investigated the effectiveness of the Tupler technique for the treatment of rectus diastase.']",1,The lack of studies investigating the effectiveness of the Tupler technique for rectus diastasis indicates that there is no scientific support for its claimed benefits.,We could not find a single study that examined whether the Tupler technique actually works. And this despite the fact that providers of the method advertise that its effectiveness is scientifically proven.
Can CBD (cannabidiol) help with migraines or other headaches?,"['Apparently, CBD has never been investigated to see if it can help with migraine seizures.', 'The claim that CBD would help with migraines or headaches is pure speculation.', 'The studies in detail Despite extensive search in three databases, we could not find any studies on CBD against migraine or other types of headache, neither for treatment nor for prevention.']",1,The lack of studies investigating the effects of CBD on migraines or headaches indicates that there is insufficient evidence to support the claim that CBD can help with these conditions.,There are no studies that have investigated the effectiveness of CBD against migraine. So claims that CBD can help with or prevent migraine attacks have no scientific basis. The same is true for other types of headache.
"In everyday life, when breathing with an FFP2 mask or ordinary mouth-nose protection, do you get as much oxygen as without a mask?","['As much oxygen as without a mask This fear is, however, unfounded, as previously conducted studies show [ 1,2 ].', 'Only in very strenuous sports (fast cycling to exhaustion) was the oxygen content in the blood with FFP2 mask slightly lower than without mask.', 'There was no difference in oxygen measurement with ordinary oral nose protection.', 'Breathing a little more strenuous The results thus contradict the rumor that masks would cause an oxygen deficiency.']",0,"The provided sentences indicate that concerns about oxygen deficiency when wearing FFP2 masks or ordinary mouth-nose protection are unfounded, as studies show no significant difference in oxygen levels during normal breathing, except in very strenuous activities.","Even if breathing with a mask can feel uncomfortable: According to studies to date, you get just as much oxygen with an FFP2 mask or mouth-nose protection as without a mask. This is true even when you are moving or exerting yourself. Only very intensive sports slightly reduce the oxygen content in the blood - but too little to endanger health."
"Can a bioresonance device like ""Bioscan"" or ""Vieva Vital Analyser"" measure mineral and vitamin deficiencies or detect health problems?","['This experiment clearly shows that the devices studied are completely unsuitable to diagnose a lack of vitamins or minerals.', 'Sentenced for fraud at the end of May 2022, a German court also concluded that the Bioscan device cannot fulfil the claimed claims.', 'Claims for comparable products are equally implausible.', 'Even if 1000 subjects had participated in the study and only five to six people had shown such unreliable readings, such a device would be worthless for diagnostics.']",2,"The sentences indicate that devices like Bioscan are unsuitable for diagnosing vitamin or mineral deficiencies, with a court ruling confirming their inability to fulfill claimed functions, thus undermining the claim about their diagnostic capabilities.","An experiment shows that the devices cannot distinguish between healthy people, seriously ill people and a corpse. The claimed mode of action behind the measurement method is also scientifically implausible. A German court has convicted the manufacturers of the Bioscan device (not legally binding) of fraud."
Does arthroscopy (joint endoscopy) help with osteoarthritis of the knee joint?,"['What might sound logical, however, has a catch: the arthroscopy of osteoarthritis does nothing to the treated person.', 'Studies clearly speak against a benefit A research team summarized the most meaningful of all previously published studies on arthroscopy in knee arthritis.', 'In these studies, patients treated after arthroscopy had no noticeably less pain or movement restrictions than those treated only for appearance or not at all.', 'Arthroscopy against osteoarthritis: not effective, but also not very risky After all: Undesirable events were not conspicuously common in the arthroscopy groups either.']",2,"The provided sentences indicate that arthroscopy for osteoarthritis of the knee does not lead to significant improvements in pain or mobility compared to other treatments, suggesting that it is ineffective for this condition.",The data are clear: Arthroscopy is useless as a treatment for knee osteoarthritis. It can neither relieve pain nor improve the function of the knee joint in the long term.
"Do dietary supplements containing silicon (e.g. as ""organic silicon"" or silica) have health benefits?","['So far it is also completely unclear what role the element silicon plays in the human body at all [8].', 'We have researched: Previous studies do not provide any evidence that dietary supplements with silicon support bone build-up and thus protect older women from osteoporosis and bone fractures in old age [1,2].', 'There is no evidence that silicon improves the hair structure [3,4], strengthens the fingernails [4] or makes the skin more beautiful and elastic [4,6,7].', 'Also that silicon supports the formation of collagen and connective tissue is only a conjecture [8].', 'Conjectures without studies Neither we nor the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) [8] were able to find clinical studies on any other alleged health benefits of silicon.']",1,"The available research indicates that there is no substantial evidence to support the claim that dietary supplements containing silicon provide health benefits, as studies have not demonstrated any positive effects on bone health, hair structure, nail strength, skin quality, or collagen formation.","There is no evidence so far that the additional intake of silicon can promote health. Also that it strengthens nails, skin and hair is an unsubstantiated claim. Moreover, it is unclear whether silicon plays any role at all in the body."
Can regular intake of cranberry juice or cranberry extract prevent recurrent cystitis in women?,"['The summarized results show that the regular intake of cranberry products could have a preventive effect.', 'There is also only evidence that cranberry products can prevent bladder inflammation for otherwise healthy women.', 'Overall, there is evidence of a possible preventive effect of cranberry.']",0,"The sentences indicate that while there is some evidence suggesting a preventive effect of cranberry products on bladder inflammation in otherwise healthy women, the overall findings do not conclusively support the claim that regular intake can prevent recurrent cystitis in women.","Women who repeatedly have to deal with bladder infections might become ill somewhat less frequently if they regularly take cranberry juice or extract. However, this is not well established. And it only applies to uncomplicated bladder infections in otherwise healthy women. Whether cranberry products help when cystitis is already present remains unclear. This has not yet been investigated in meaningful studies."
Will women who have recurrent bladder infections get rid of them faster if they take cranberry products only after the disease is already there???,"['There is also only evidence that cranberry products can prevent bladder inflammation for otherwise healthy women.', 'However, there does not seem to be any meaningful studies that have investigated this in women with recurrent bladder inflammation.', 'The preventive effect of cranberry in children, men and people with urinary catheters or certain diseases has not been studied.']",1,"The sentences indicate that while cranberry products may prevent bladder inflammation in healthy women, there is a lack of meaningful studies specifically addressing their effectiveness in women with recurrent bladder infections, leaving the claim unsubstantiated.","Women who repeatedly have to deal with bladder infections might become ill somewhat less frequently if they regularly take cranberry juice or extract.

Can extract from St. John's wort relieve the symptoms of depression? Is it similarly effective as drugs against depression (antidepressants)?,"[""St John's wort: effective in mild to moderate depression Probably yes."", ""In mild to moderate depression, St John's wort preparations probably work better than placebo."", ""St John's wort preparations are probably as good as antidepressants."", ""St. John's wort and antidepressants can relieve the discomfort, but the depression can probably not cure for good.""]",0,"St. John's wort is likely effective for mild to moderate depression and may be comparable to antidepressants, but it does not guarantee a permanent cure for depression.",St. John's wort is likely to relieve the symptoms of mild to moderate depression better than a placebo. It also appears to be similarly effective to approved medications for depression (antidepressants). St. John's wort preparations are generally better tolerated than antidepressants.
Can ginkgo extract improve mental performance in dementia patients?,"['Dementia patients taking Ginkgo extract often seemed to perform better in thinking, memory, and concentration tasks than those who swallowed placebo preparations without an active substance [1.3].', 'Although the studies indicate that Ginkgo extract can help people with dementia, the significance of the individual studies is limited.']",0,"The sentences indicate that while some dementia patients taking Ginkgo extract appeared to perform better in cognitive tasks compared to those on a placebo, the overall significance of the studies is limited, suggesting that the claim lacks strong support.",Previous studies suggest that ginkgo extract can improve mental performance in dementia - but this is not well established. It is not possible to say exactly how large this effect is.
Does pine wood improve sleep?,"['So there is no indication that the pine wood improves sleep.', 'The importance of these laboratory measurements for the sleep of the participants is unclear – even if the researchers interpret them as positive effects of the circling bed.', 'Whether a pine bed actually improves sleep would have to study more rigorous studies carried out according to scientific criteria on significantly more subjects in the future.The studies in detail [1,2] Grote et al.']",1,"The sentences indicate that there is no clear evidence supporting the claim that pine wood improves sleep, and further rigorous studies are needed to draw any conclusions.","So far, only one small study has investigated this question. However, the results of this study are not conclusive due to numerous deficiencies in the conduct of the study."
Do spermidine supplements or a spermidine-rich diet reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia? Do they help with existing dementia?,"['Spermidin studies: not enough as evidence of efficacy Even if both studies had come to overwhelmingly positive results, we would still have concerns about their significance.', 'Spermidine, which is additionally absorbed by food, is not sufficiently researched at the present time.', 'The number of participants is low and the risk is high that the results are not transferable to reality.', 'We do not consider the study to be meaningful.', 'Results: Both the spermidine group and the comparator group had fewer dementia symptoms and better mental performance at the end of the study.']",1,"The available studies on spermidine do not provide sufficient evidence to conclude that spermidine supplements or a spermidine-rich diet effectively reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease or help with existing dementia, as concerns about the significance and transferability of the results remain.","Manufacturers of spermidine drugs advertise an alleged positive effect on mental performance and protection against dementia.

However, the rheumatism treatment of the participants does not meet today's standards and the studies were very poorly conducted. Therefore, we cannot draw any reliable conclusions from these studies."
Does covid vaccination reduce the likelihood of getting long-lasting symptoms (long covid) in case of corona infection?,"['Long-Covid risk with low vaccination Two studies [1,2] suggest that the long-covid risk is likely to be lower if vaccinated twice: In one of these studies with Corona infected [1], twice vaccinated patients reported 40 to 50 percent less likely to be affected by Long Covid compared to non-vaccinated patients.', 'Results Two-fold Vaccinated people reported to be affected by long-covid symptoms only about half as often as non-vaccinated people.']",0,"The sentences indicate that vaccinated individuals are significantly less likely to experience long-covid symptoms compared to those who are unvaccinated, suggesting that vaccination may reduce the likelihood of long-lasting symptoms after a corona infection.","If twice-vaccinated people are infected, their risk of later being affected by Long Covid may be only half that of non-vaccinated people. Since there is no clear definition of long covid, the protective effect cannot be precisely quantified."
Can the preventive intake of lysine prevent cold sores (lip herpes) and genital herpes?

All available studies are small and of unclear quality. We could not say whether lysine protects against herpes or can alleviate it.
"Do hormonal contraceptives to swallow (the ""pill"") affect endurance performance in women?","['The conclusion of the work: Women taking the pill could actually have a minor disadvantage in sports.', 'Specifically, women with a pill may absorb less oxygen during training and are out of breath faster.', 'Possibly a slightly lower performance through the pill – to this conclusion also came another current overview work [2].']",0,Women taking hormonal contraceptives may experience a minor disadvantage in endurance sports due to potentially reduced oxygen absorption and quicker onset of breathlessness during training.,"Taking the pill could possibly impair endurance performance in sports somewhat. However, there are no indications of less muscle strength due to the pill. However, these - somewhat contradictory - findings are anything but certain. Whether the somewhat reduced endurance performance speaks against contraception with the pill, each athlete must decide for herself - depending on how important top athletic performance is for her."
Does the pill affect the muscle strength of women??,"['Does the pill also affect muscle strength?', 'The available studies do not provide any indication of such an effect.']",2,"The sentences indicate that available studies do not show any evidence of the pill affecting muscle strength, which directly addresses the claim about its impact on women's muscle strength.","Taking the pill could possibly impair endurance performance in sports somewhat.

Is Bulletproof Coffee recommended?,"['Conclusion Published studies with human subjects who have dealt with the subject of Bulletproof Coffee are not available.', 'It also lacks the basis to make statements about side effects and long-term safety of this food form.', 'Thus it should not be quite easy to make various effects dingfest.', 'Ingredients under the microscope We have not found any clinical studies on the effects of Bulletproof Coffee.', 'However, there are still various unexplained aspects around these references.']",1,The lack of published studies on Bulletproof Coffee and its effects on human subjects makes it difficult to recommend its use or assess its safety.,"Bulletproof coffee is high in caffeine and fat. Is the hip breakfast substitute a kind of fitness potion? Or is it even harmful? Because there have been no studies on this coffee blend with human test subjects, we cannot make any reliable statements."
Do apples help with smoking cessation?,"['However, it is open which ingredients of apples should take the pleasure of tormenting – scientific evidence for this claim is missing.', 'However, apples do not appear in this context and in evidence-based recommendations [a], at least not as an aid.', 'However, the effects are small, and whether the apple taste is responsible can only be speculated.', 'On the other hand, it is not researched whether the apple really takes the appetite for the cigarette.']",1,"The sentences indicate a lack of scientific evidence supporting the claim that apples aid in smoking cessation, with no clear research demonstrating their effectiveness in reducing cigarette cravings.",Apples contain numerous ingredients and rightly have the reputation of being a healthy snack. Whether they can help to give up cigarettes has not yet been investigated in studies.
Do products made from fenugreek seeds help you lose weight?,"['However, the results do not indicate that an extract of plant seeds could help to reduce weight.', 'It is therefore unclear whether fenugreek seeds are able to lower blood sugar both in the short term and over longer periods of time.', 'Therefore, it remains unclear to what extent fenugreek seeds can be helpful in weight loss.', 'Whether the Fenulife product helps with weight loss can by no means be demonstrated by a study carried out for only three days.', 'The result is sobering: no meaningful studies of high quality were found.']",1,"The sentences indicate a lack of meaningful studies and clear evidence regarding the effectiveness of fenugreek seeds for weight loss, leaving the claim unsubstantiated.","We found only one study in which participants had not lost weight after six weeks. However, the study period is very short, the number of participants small and the quality mediocre. It therefore remains unclear whether fenugreek seeds can help lose weight in the longer term."
Does skipping breakfast increase heart attack risk?,"['Obviously, therefore, the main reason for the increased risk of heart attacks was not to skip the morning meal, but overweight, diabetes, increased blood pressure, or too high cholesterol levels.', 'Thus, it is unclear whether the omission of breakfast leads to overweight or excess weight leads to the omission of breakfast.']",1,"The sentences indicate that the increased risk of heart attacks is more likely associated with factors like overweight and diabetes rather than skipping breakfast, and they also highlight the ambiguity regarding the relationship between breakfast omission and weight, suggesting insufficient clarity on the claim.","There is no clear evidence that not eating breakfast could be a cause of obesity and, as a consequence, an increased risk of heart attack. It is possible, however, that it is primarily those people who are overweight and have a higher heart risk who forgo their morning meal."
Does wheat make you fat and sick?,"['But even if all of these mechanisms were correctly described, this does not necessarily mean that wheat makes you sick – the interplay of all mechanisms is not known.', 'Thus, the reduction of excess weight leads to health improvements, not the elimination of wheat.']",1,"The sentences indicate that the relationship between wheat and health issues is not clearly established, and that weight reduction, rather than the elimination of wheat, is linked to health improvements.",There is no evidence in current studies that wheat has a special connection with obesity and its consequences. Attributing a special role to wheat seems implausible.
Do whole grains lower the likelihood of dying early?,"['Against cancer, heart problems and diabetes The current study situation shows something else: Those who frequently resort to whole grains get less cancer or cardiovascular diseases, for example a heart attack [1–4].', 'Thus, people in whom whole grains play a major role in their daily diet seem to live longer and healthier.', 'All four summaries come to the same conclusion: They show a clear correlation between a full-grain diet and a reduced chance of dying early.', 'At least as far as the reduced risk of disease is concerned, the data show a robust dose-effect relationship: the more whole grains are eaten, the lower the risk of disease [6].']",0,"The provided sentences indicate a clear correlation between a diet rich in whole grains and a reduced risk of diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular issues, suggesting that whole grains may contribute to a longer and healthier life.",People who eat whole grain products instead of foods made from refined flour are likely to live longer and probably have a lower risk of dying from cancer or cardiovascular disease.
"Does the consumption of dairy products promote mucus and diseases of the ear, nose and throat?","['No correlation between milk consumption and laboratory values The results of studies published so far in a systematic review do not indicate that high milk consumption increases inflammation levels in the blood.', ""However, the fact that the long-standing popular belief that cow's milk has a smearing effect is not likely to be confirmed by this, according to current knowledge.""]",1,"The provided sentences indicate that there is no evidence linking high milk consumption to increased inflammation or a smearing effect, which challenges the claim that dairy products promote mucus and related diseases.",There is no scientific evidence to prove that cow's milk causes mucus.
Does regular consumption of energy drinks harm heart health?,"['Thus, energy drinks could potentially increase heart rate and blood pressure in the short term, but this is not the case in all studies.', 'However, the fact that the energy drinks had caused death is not certain.', 'There is no evidence that caffeine can cause cardiac arrhythmias or atrial fibrillation at moderate doses.', 'Larger doses of energy drinks can cause, for example, heart turf, tremor, arousal and digestive problems.']",1,"The sentences indicate that while energy drinks may increase heart rate and blood pressure temporarily, there is no definitive evidence linking them to serious heart health issues, suggesting a lack of consensus on their long-term effects.",This question is insufficiently researched. Larger studies over a longer period of time are needed to assess the heart risk from energy drinks.
Does sugar consumption increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes regardless of obesity?,"['Soft drinks increase the risk of diabetes People with a preference for large amounts of sugar-containing sodas also suffer more frequently from diabetes.', 'In their analyses, two research teams [1,2] were able to independently show that the more sugar the study participants consume in the form of soft drinks, the higher the probability of developing type 2 diabetes.', 'It seems that daily consumption of sugared soft drinks can trigger diabetes over many years even if it does not make you fat.', 'Sugar content of other foods with unclear influence The association with type 2 diabetes is relatively clear for soft drinks.']",0,"The sentences indicate a clear association between sugar consumption, particularly from soft drinks, and an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, suggesting that this risk exists independently of obesity.","Sugar-containing soft drinks can - if consumed regularly - cause obesity. Obesity, in turn, increases the likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes. However, sugared soft drinks probably also increase the risk of diabetes independently of obesity."
Does a lower salt diet reduce the likelihood of cardiovascular disease?,"['Whether the many salt in the food was really the reason for cardiovascular diseases, however, cannot be unquestionably clarified.', 'The result: a low-salt diet seems to be able to actually reduce the likelihood of cardiovascular diseases.', 'Those who reduce their salt consumption can reduce blood pressure in the medium term.', 'Lowering the risk of consequential diseases caused by high blood pressure can help a diet that is poorer in salt.']",0,"The sentences indicate that a low-salt diet may reduce the likelihood of cardiovascular diseases by lowering blood pressure and mitigating risks associated with high blood pressure, although the exact causal relationship remains uncertain.","A lower-salt diet has been shown to help reduce elevated blood pressure somewhat. It is possible, but not certain, that this reduces the likelihood of dying from a stroke or the consequences of narrowed heart vessels, such as a heart attack."
Is less eaten from red plates?,"['The result: The test subjects who were served their pretzels on red plates accessed significantly less than participants with blue or white plates.', 'In a second experiment, subjects also drank soft drinks in a larger amount of blue instead of red cups.', 'As logical as this explanation may sound, the study does not yet provide scientific evidence that red plates really eat less.', 'In both salty and sweet snacks, the participants gained less when they were lying on a red plate in front of them.']",0,"The sentences indicate that while there are observations of less consumption from red plates, the study does not provide conclusive scientific evidence to support the claim that red plates lead to reduced eating.","In two psychological experiments, participants were less likely to eat salty pretzels, popcorn or chocolate chips if they were served on red plates. It is unclear whether the effect lasts over a longer period of time."
Does red wine protect better against cardiovascular disease than white wine?,"['However, they usually did not distinguish between white and red wine [1] [2] [3].', 'It can therefore not be proven that red wine protects particularly well against cardiovascular diseases.', 'Thus, people who consume small amounts of alcohol daily seem to have a lower cardiovascular risk and live a little longer than strict non-drinkers [1] [2] [3] [4].', 'The result: For a moderate dose of eight to ten grams of pure alcohol per day, the overall mortality and risk of cardiovascular disease were lower than for non- or minor drinkers.', 'The impact of the studies is limited Even if people who eat a glass of wine or beer daily live longer and healthier, this does not necessarily mean that alcoholic beverages are responsible.']",1,"The sentences indicate that while moderate alcohol consumption may be associated with lower cardiovascular risk, they do not provide conclusive evidence that red wine specifically offers better protection against cardiovascular disease compared to white wine.","There is evidence that moderate amounts of alcohol may protect against cardiovascular disease, but the effect is not well established. Whether this possibly protective effect is stronger with red wine than with white wine or other alcoholic beverages has not been sufficiently investigated."
Do azo food dyes cause attention deficit disorder and hyperactivity in children?,"['Since 2010, the EU has committed manufacturers to label food with azo dyes ""May affect the activity and attention of children"".', 'However, the summarized results of these and other previously published studies provide clear evidence that artificial food colours can cause attention and hyperactivity disorder (ADHS).', 'Although the bright-colored dyes could be a partial cause of ADHD, there are certainly many other unknown triggers [5].', 'The studies in detail The fact that azo dyes could be responsible for behavioural abnormalities of children suggests a clean summary of previous studies [2].', 'Compared to children who continued to consume azo dyes, behavioural abnormalities decreased slightly.']",0,"The sentences indicate that while there is some evidence suggesting a link between azo food dyes and behavioral issues in children, it is not definitive, and other factors may also contribute to attention deficit disorder and hyperactivity.",Some studies fuel the suspicion that azo dyes can exacerbate ADHD symptoms.
Does turmeric prevent or cure cancer?,"['However, well-executed studies of this kind have so far been scarce.', 'After 6 months of administration, the values did not differ between turmeric and dummy subjects.', 'This makes it unclear whether any improvement observed is due to turmeric treatment or whether the health status of the study participants would have improved without turmeric.']",1,"The sentences indicate a lack of well-executed studies on turmeric's effects, with no significant differences observed between turmeric and placebo, leaving the potential benefits of turmeric in cancer prevention or treatment uncertain.",Animal studies provide tentative evidence that turmeric can prevent or treat cancer. Whether turmeric has such an effect in humans cannot be assessed due to the low confidence level of a few studies conducted to date.
Does breastfeeding reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome?,"['The scientists conclude that the risk of breastfed children is halved compared to un breastfed children [2].', 'However, the matter has a small catch: the studies analysed show a connection.', 'The studies in detail The fact that breastfeeding reduces the risk of unexpected death of a baby is only moderately secure.', 'However, this does not necessarily prove that breastfeeding is the reason for the lower risk of infant death.']",0,"The sentences indicate that while there is a suggestion that breastfeeding may reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome, the evidence is not definitive enough to establish a causal relationship.","Breastfeeding can possibly reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome, but this is not entirely certain. Other factors can also reduce the risk."
Can glutamate in food cause intolerance symptoms?,"['There are many case reports of an alleged glutamate hypersensitivity, but these can hardly be verified.', 'But among the alleged glutamate-sensitive subjects there was no one who showed symptoms after all glutamate [3].', 'The available studies show that up to three grams of glutamate does not cause symptoms in a selected group of healthy individuals.']",1,"The sentences indicate that while there are reports of glutamate hypersensitivity, they lack verification, and studies show that glutamate does not cause symptoms in healthy individuals, suggesting insufficient evidence to confirm intolerance symptoms from glutamate in food.","There is no conclusive evidence that the consumption of glutamate triggers complaints. However, since studies conducted to date have shown deficiencies, it cannot be ruled out that there are isolated individuals who react sensitively to large amounts of glutamate."
Is it harmful for the mental development of the unborn child if the mother regularly eats fish contaminated with mercury during pregnancy?,"['For previous studies suggest that the consumption of larger amounts of mercury-containing fish could slightly affect the mental performance of the offspring [1, 2, 3].', 'The studies in detail The fact that methyl mercury can damage the brain of unborn children already in concentrations in which the pregnant mothers themselves do not notice any symptoms is beyond question [6].', 'In investigations into the Faroe Islands and New Zealand, the assumption was confirmed: expectant mothers with high mercury levels were given children, whose mental performance was on average slightly worse in later tests than that of unloaded mothers – the mercury levels of the mothers were mostly so high, because they had consumed large amounts of contaminated fish before and during pregnancy.', 'Impact on the IQ Despite these contradictions, the consumption of contaminated fish seems to reduce the intelligence of the offspring measurable, although it is not yet clear how much.', ""A research team at Harvard University calculated an average reduction in the intelligence ratio of 0.7 points for each micrograms of mercury in mother's hair [2] in the analysis of studies from the Faroe Islands, Seychelles and New Zealand.""]",0,"The provided sentences indicate that consuming mercury-contaminated fish during pregnancy can negatively impact the mental development of the unborn child, as studies have shown a correlation between high mercury levels in mothers and reduced mental performance in their offspring.","Many commercially available types of edible fish are contaminated with traces of methyl mercury. There are indications that regular consumption of such mercury-containing fish during pregnancy can impair the brain development of unborn children and thus their later mental abilities. In contrast, consumption of fish low in mercury could promote brain development in the unborn."
Can the consumption of caffeine during pregnancy harm the unborn child?,"['However, the study showed that it made no difference whether the participants drank around three cups of caffeine or decaffeinated coffee.', ""On average, the weight of birth at birth was about the same, was similar in size and was not more frequently born too early even after the mother's caffeine consumption."", 'Similar to the summary of the Cochrane overview work: In early pregnancy three cups of coffee daily would have no effect on birth weight, growth or premature birth [2].']",1,"The provided sentences indicate that caffeine consumption during pregnancy does not significantly affect birth weight, growth, or the likelihood of premature birth, suggesting that it may not harm the unborn child.",There is insufficient evidence that moderate consumption of caffeinated beverages would have a negative impact on the child's development. Up to three cups of coffee a day does not appear to reduce the child's birth weight. Very large amounts of caffeine-containing beverages could possibly contribute to lower birth weight.
Can garlic extract reduce high blood pressure and thus the risk of cardiovascular disease?,"['Two better performed randomised-controlled studies provide cautious evidence that garlic can lower too high blood pressure [1].', 'However, even the results of these two studies are insufficiently valid for a clear assessment [1].', 'Whether garlic taken regularly can lower too high blood pressure and thus lower the risk of cardiovascular disease remains unclear for the time being.', 'At least in theory, there may also be interactions with anticoagulant drugs or side effects in persons with a tendency to bleed, as garlic is suspected to have an anticoagulant effect.']",1,"The sentences indicate that while there is some cautious evidence from two studies suggesting garlic may lower high blood pressure, the validity of these results is insufficient for a definitive conclusion, leaving the potential impact on cardiovascular disease risk unclear.","Studies to date provide tentative evidence of a blood pressure-lowering effect of garlic. However, they are of too low quality to be able to prove a reduction in the risk of cardiovascular disease as a result of high blood pressure."
Can green tea affect the likelihood of dying early and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease?,"['In fact, the summarized results of observational studies show that passionate green tea drinkers live longer on average – apparently because they are less likely to die from cardiovascular diseases such as heart attack [2,3].', ""However, a 100% proven cause-effect relationship à la ‘Green tea use protects against stroke, heart attack and co' cannot be derived from these observational studies."", 'We do not know exactly what the substances from the green tea in our body do – and what amounts can trigger a positive health effect.', 'Overall, the study data show that passionate green tea drinkers are less likely to die from cardiovascular diseases and thus live longer overall.', 'Seven RCTs are summarized here, and the authors concluded that green tea as a beverage or dietary supplement may have a beneficial influence on the risk factors of blood pressure, total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol.']",0,"The sentences indicate that while passionate green tea drinkers appear to have a lower risk of dying from cardiovascular diseases and may live longer, the evidence is based on observational studies that do not establish a definitive cause-effect relationship.","There is a lack of conclusive studies on the health effects of specific matcha.

Can green tea reduce the likelihood of dying from cancer ?,"['In some studies, there was indeed a slightly reduced probability of disease, but other studies even suggested an increased risk of cancer from the use of green tea.', 'The result provides sobering clarity: people who regularly drink large amounts of green tea die in sum as often at some kind of cancer as people who hardly touch green tea [8].', 'To a degree harmless Although the benefits of green tea against cancer are questionable, there is no evidence of a health-impairing effect in moderate consumption of some cups a day [2].']",2,"The sentences indicate that while some studies suggest a slight reduction in cancer risk associated with green tea, others show no significant difference in cancer mortality rates between heavy green tea drinkers and those who consume little, leading to uncertainty about its protective effects against cancer.",The results of previous studies suggest that green tea cannot reduce the risk of dying from cancer.
Is the sweetener aspartame harmful to health?,"['The result: the sweetener is in all probability safe.', 'Safety levels Based on the results of numerous studies in laboratory animals and humans, the scientists established a safety limit for aspartame.', 'Thus, every person can take 40 milligrams per kilogram of body weight every day for the rest of his life without fear of health consequences.', 'Even those who exceed this amount will not suffer any health hazard.']",2,"The provided sentences indicate that aspartame is considered safe for consumption based on numerous studies, suggesting that it does not pose health risks even at higher intake levels.","Health damage from aspartame is unlikely. This also applies to people who consume aspartame-sweetened foods and beverages in large quantities over a long period of time. However, in people suffering from the hereditary disease phenylketonuria (PKU), aspartame can cause nerve and brain damage."
Does coffee affect cancer death risk?,"['Both studies concluded that coffee consumption has no effect on cancer mortality.', 'In other words, coffee generally does not seem to favor or prevent death through cancer.', 'For breast cancer, prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer and bladder cancer there seems to be no association with the consumption of coffee.', 'Conclusion: Coffee consumption does not seem to affect cancer mortality.', 'They did not detect any influence of coffee on the number of cancer deaths.']",2,"The provided sentences indicate that multiple studies found no significant relationship between coffee consumption and cancer mortality, suggesting that coffee does not influence the risk of death from cancer.",Current evidence suggests that coffee consumption in general is neither protective nor detrimental to cancer death risk.
Do diets with primarily or exclusively uncooked foods have health benefits?,"['Whether raw food followers suffer a heart attack or stroke less often, need less medication or live longer overall, can not be derived from this.', 'Conclusion A health benefit of raw food, which goes beyond an increased consumption of vegetable foods, has not been conclusively proven.', 'Rather, there are indications that strict raw food diets may also have a negative impact on health – similar to other diets that severely restrict food selection.']",1,"The sentences indicate that while there is no conclusive proof of health benefits from raw food diets beyond increased vegetable consumption, there are also concerns about potential negative health impacts from such restrictive diets.","In studies, we have not been able to find convincing evidence that raw foods provide health benefits over healthy diets that include cooked foods. On the contrary, there is also evidence of possible harm."
Can increased water consumption prevent migraines or other headaches?,"['Preventive effect of water unclear In 2011, Dutch researchers published a study [1] according to which drinking an additional one and a half liters of water per day could significantly relieve headaches.', 'Until strict clinical studies with a larger number of patients have been conducted, the effectiveness of increased water consumption cannot really be assessed.', 'However, if increased drinking can actually prevent headaches, the effect may not be particularly large.']",1,"Increased water consumption may have some potential to relieve headaches, but the current evidence is inconclusive and lacks sufficient clinical studies to definitively assess its effectiveness.","Whether drinking more water can prevent headaches cannot be answered satisfactorily on the basis of studies conducted to date.

Are there health benefits to screening the general population for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as a precaution?,"['Recommendation against COPD screening The answer may surprise: such a precautionary examination does not bring any discernible health benefit.', ""If you don't have any symptoms yet and only learns about a COPD due to the screening, you may not have any benefit at all [1,2]."", 'Here, too, a population-wide COPD early detection does not bring any health benefit.']",2,"Screening the general population for COPD does not provide any health benefits, especially for asymptomatic individuals who may not gain any advantage from such precautionary measures.",Even people with moderately severe COPD may have little health benefit from starting treatment as early as possible. People without symptoms who are diagnosed with COPD only as a result of a screening test are therefore unlikely to gain much health benefit from drug treatment.
Can cow's milk cause iron deficiency in babies in the first year of life?,"[""Moreover, the infant can use iron from cow's milk much worse, because among other things the calcium and casein contained in it inhibits the absorption of iron."", ""Babies actually seem to suffer more from iron deficiency when they are fed cow's milk early on."", ""Only as far as iron deficiency is concerned, statements are possible: Seven out of eight studies suggest that early use of cow's milk in babies significantly increases the risk of iron deficiency.""]",0,"The sentences indicate that early consumption of cow's milk in infants is associated with a higher risk of iron deficiency, suggesting that cow's milk can negatively impact iron absorption in babies.","Cow's milk is low in usable iron.

Does Cryolipolysis cause noticeable body fat reduction?,"['Whether the method can effectively reduce body fat cannot be said based on its results.', 'Whether the reason for the alleged figure improvements after three to six or twelve months was actually the cold treatment, however, can not be determined by previous-after-comparisons without an untreated control group anyway.', 'Even if the authors of previously published studies conjure the effectiveness of cryolipolysis – this cannot be objectively assessed on the basis of their results.']",1,The sentences indicate that the effectiveness of cryolipolysis in reducing body fat cannot be conclusively determined due to the lack of objective assessment and control groups in previous studies.,"The effectiveness of cryolipolysis cannot be assessed objectively, as there are no scientific efficacy studies on it."
Is acupuncture for chronic pain more effective than placebo acupuncture treatment?,"['Acupuncture slightly surpasses dummy treatment A recent study is now to show that the pain-relieving effect of acupuncture exceeds that of a mere placebo effect, several media write.', 'The very thorough analysis of all these clinical studies showed that acupuncture in chronic pain was not only better than no treatment, but also slightly better than a sham acupuncture.', 'Also in fibromyalgia, a chronic pain disorder of the musculature, acupuncture probably has a slight, but hardly noticeably better effect than sham acupuncture [9].', 'Even if the mechanism of action of acupuncture is unknown and the placebo effect is partly responsible for its analgesic effect, it appears to be an interesting alternative or additional therapy for patients with chronic pain.']",0,"Acupuncture has been shown to have a slight advantage over sham treatments in managing chronic pain, indicating that it may be more effective than placebo acupuncture.","Acupuncture is slightly superior to sham acupuncture treatment for some types of pain. However, pain patients are unlikely to notice this difference."
Can Internet-based self-help training based on cognitive behavioral therapy reduce the burden of tinnitus?,"['Accordingly, the authors of a systematic review of Cochrane Collaboration [ 1 ] found strong evidence that cognitive behavioral therapy can lead to a noticeable improvement in the quality of life despite persistent tinnitus.', 'In addition, the therapy can lead to a low relief of depressive moods, which suffer from numerous tinnitus patients.', 'The self-help training developed at Linköping University in Sweden is a version of an already proven cognitive behavioral therapy program for tinnitus patients adapted to the Internet.', 'But also a newly developed Internet program to increase tinnitus acceptance with the help of mindfulness-based strategies proved equally effective.', 'Summary It seems likely that cognitive therapies for tinnitus management not only bring improvement in traditional group sessions, but also in the form of Internet-based self-help training programs.']",0,"The evidence indicates that cognitive behavioral therapy, including Internet-based self-help training, can improve the quality of life for tinnitus patients and may also alleviate depressive symptoms associated with tinnitus.","Cognitive behavioral therapy can noticeably improve the quality of life and depressiveness of tinnitus sufferers. Internet-based self-help training based on cognitive behavioral therapy could be similarly helpful, but is often discontinued by sufferers."
Do probiotic foods have an antidepressant effect or a positive effect on the mind?,"['The study referred to in oe24.at [1] cannot answer the question whether probiotic foods improve the mood.', 'The scientists do not indicate whether the probiotically treated subjects were already less depressed and anxious before the start of the experiment than those who did not receive a probiotic product.']",1,"The sentences indicate that the study cannot determine whether probiotic foods have a positive effect on mood, as it does not clarify the initial mental state of the subjects involved.","Whether probiotics can help with depression or have a positive effect on the mood has never been investigated in clinical trials. In people with constipation, they could possibly improve mood."
Does treatment with radioactive agents help with pain in chronic inflammatory joint disease?,"['If the correct amount of a suitable radioactive substance is injected directly into the joint, the radiation causes the swollen and inflamed joint mucosa to die – after healing, a healthy skin can grow back, the inflammation is gone [1].', 'According to a 2009 overview study, success rates in small joints vary from 54 to 100 percent pain reduction 12 months after treatment, from 29 to 94 percent pain reduction in large joints [1].', 'A somewhat recent randomized-controlled study compared two drugs for radiosynoviorthesis and cortisone: after 48 weeks, the frequently used yttrium performed better than cortisone and the comparator, but only in a single point – namely on a particular pain scale.']",0,"The sentences indicate that treatment with radioactive agents can lead to significant pain reduction in chronic inflammatory joint disease, with success rates reported in various studies, suggesting a potential benefit of this treatment.","Depending on the cause of the pain, radiosynoviorthesis can lead to considerable pain reduction, as confirmed by a 2009 review. However, it is not proven whether the treatment is more effective than cortisone treatment."
Does frequent porn use reduce gray matter volume in the brain?,"['[1] Cause and effect The study shows a correlation between frequent consumption of porn and the size of a brain region, but cannot provide any information as to whether the size of the gray brain mass changes due to consumption of porn.', 'No damage detectable In 2011, three Californian researchers pointed out that there was no evidence of brain damage due to porn consumption.', 'All studies that went in this direction have the same problem as the current study: It is not clear what is the cause and what is the effect – there is no study that actually investigates the long-term effects of porn consumption on the brain.']",1,"The sentences indicate that while there is a correlation between frequent porn consumption and brain structure, there is no definitive evidence to establish a causal relationship or to confirm any changes in gray matter volume due to porn use.",The study is not powered to examine the long-term effects of pornography on the brain and other studies on this were not found.
Can the active ingredient acetyl salicylic acid (ASA) protect against cancer?,"['Minor reduction in cancer risk According to a recent systematic review [ 1 ], daily intake of ASA actually results in a minor reduction in cancer risk.', 'Among 1000 subjects who took ASA, 16 people died of cancer on average, while those who received only an ineffective dummy medication (placebo) were19.', 'In a cohort study over ten years, the intake of ASA only led to a reduced risk of colorectal cancer every other day, but also to increased gastrointestinal bleeding [5].']",0,"The sentences indicate that while daily intake of acetyl salicylic acid (ASA) may lead to a minor reduction in cancer risk, it is specifically noted to only reduce the risk of colorectal cancer and is associated with increased gastrointestinal bleeding, suggesting limited protective effects against cancer overall.","Taking ASA daily for several years seems to be able to reduce the risk of dying from cancer somewhat. However, it increases the risk of severe internal bleeding and stomach problems."
Is tick-borne tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) much milder in children than in adults?,"['Although only 20 children participated in this study, there is a certain trend: young patients generally had less severe symptoms and recovered faster than adults.', 'Except for one case of complete vaccination and two cases of incomplete vaccination, the affected children were unvaccinated [11] and more frequently developed meningitis, while adults were more likely to fight with the more dangerous inflammation of the brain and cerebral membranes (meningo-encephalitis).']",0,"The sentences indicate that children generally experience less severe symptoms and recover faster than adults, suggesting that tick-borne encephalitis may be milder in children.","Current studies suggest that TBE is probably associated with milder symptoms in children than in adults.

Does less than 7h of sleep daily increase mental performance?,"['Already six hours of sleep reduce brain performance The results of a small randomized-controlled study [1] clearly contradict the claim of performance-enhancing sleep loss.', 'After only a few nights it became apparent: the shorter the participants could sleep at night, the worse they did in the tests compared to the group with eight hours of sleep.', 'The performance of the sleep deficit group was significantly worse after five days compared to the control group, although the impact is limited by the small size of the control group.', 'This shows that lack of sleep actually seemed to be the cause of the worse mental performance.', 'Overall, if you sleep only six or less hours per night, you will hardly be wiser, but it seems to impair your mental performance.']",2,"The provided sentences indicate that getting less than seven hours of sleep negatively impacts mental performance, as evidenced by studies showing worse test results for those with shorter sleep durations compared to those who slept eight hours.",Two small randomized-controlled studies indicate that mental performance decreases with the number of sleepless hours per night and the number of nights with insufficient sleep. No single scientific study provides evidence of an increase in mental performance due to shorter sleep duration.
Do frequent ejaculations have a protective effect against prostate cancer?,"['Result: Men with frequent ejaculations between 20 and 30 years of age have a one-third reduced prostate cancer risk compared to those with rare ejaculations [1].', ""Taking the result seriously, it doesn't show that much self-satisfaction protects, but rather that men with very few ejaculations could have a slightly higher risk of prostate cancer."", 'Here it turns out that frequent ejaculations from the age of four years onwards or over the entire life span may reduce the risk of prostate cancer [3].', 'In sum, the study provides evidence that with increasing ejaculation frequency, the risk of prostate cancer could actually decrease.']",0,"Frequent ejaculations appear to be associated with a reduced risk of prostate cancer, particularly in younger men, suggesting a potential protective effect against the disease.","A cohort study suggests that more frequent ejaculations starting at age 40, or over a lifetime, could potentially lower the risk of prostate cancer. This is not exclusive to ejaculations from masturbation, but from any sexual activity."
Does condom use cause depression in women?,"['Like any contraceptive method, the condom has disadvantages that it causes depression in women, but is nowhere documented.', 'Maybe less fun We have not found a study that specifically investigated whether the use of condoms in sex can lead to depression in women.', 'If condoms were to promote depression, it would be unlikely that depression would decrease if used more frequently.', 'They have found no correlations between condom use and depression [4].', 'Risk factors for depression In any case, condoms cannot be found in the list of recognised risk factors.']",1,"The sentences indicate that there is no documented evidence linking condom use to depression in women, and studies have not found any correlations or recognized risk factors that would support the claim.",A study examining exactly this question was not found. Some scientific works with a broad question rather lead to the conclusion that there is no connection between depression and condom use.
Do today's children have a shorter life expectancy than their parents?,"['Overweight leads to a higher rate of premature deaths – which reduces life expectancy on average by 3 to 9 months.', 'So it would be a reversal of the trend: for the first time in a long time, children would have a life expectancy less than their parents.', 'There are some reasons to assume that it will be worse than the 3 to 9 months less: Obesity is becoming more common and occurs in increasingly younger children [1].', 'If this trend continues, there may be a reduction in life expectancy of three to five years.']",0,"The sentences indicate a concerning trend of increasing obesity among children, which could lead to a significant reduction in life expectancy, suggesting that today's children may indeed have a shorter life expectancy than their parents.","Obesity and physical inactivity are increasing risk factors worldwide that can shorten life. In 2005, a study from the USA concluded that life expectancy could be reduced by 3 to 9 months when these risks were included."
Do rising temperatures and CO2 levels increase the risk of pollen allergy?,"['It is unclear whether the increase in CO2 has already caused a noticeable increase in the amount of pollen released.', 'Influence on allergy risk unclear However, whether the increasing pollen exposure also increases the risk of developing pollen allergy for non-allergic agents is unclear.', 'Whether higher levels of pollen increase the probability of hay fever is so far unclear [5].', 'There is nothing to read about pollen becoming more aggressive in so far published studies.']",1,"The sentences indicate that the relationship between rising temperatures, CO2 levels, and the risk of pollen allergy remains uncertain, with no clear evidence linking increased pollen exposure to a higher likelihood of developing allergies.","Rising temperatures and increased CO2 concentrations cause plants to produce larger amounts of pollen over a longer period of time. However, it is unclear whether larger amounts of pollen and a longer pollen season increase the likelihood of developing pollen allergy."
Does training on vibration platforms cause a noticeable buildup of muscle strength?,"['Therefore, training on vibration platforms could actually strengthen the muscle strength of the leg muscles.', 'However, compared to conventional strengthening training, the results do not indicate superiority of vibration platforms.', 'According to the results of this study, it could be concluded at most that training on a vibration platform in combination with a diet can lead to weight loss, which could also be achieved by a conventional fitness program or a mere diet without exercise program.']",0,"Training on vibration platforms may contribute to muscle strength, but the evidence does not show that it is more effective than traditional strength training methods.","Vibration training may be helpful for building muscle strength in the legs, but it is not better than conventional training for this purpose. Whether the method is also suitable for weight reduction has not been sufficiently studied."
Does glucosamine prolong life?,"['This is exactly what happens once again in the article on glucosamine as a life prolonger: The study was conducted on nematodes (fade worms) and mice and in which glucosamine led to an extended life span [1].', 'The conclusion of the researchers: If glucosamine has the same effect in two different species and these processes are also conceivable in humans, then glucosamine is highly likely to prolong life expectancy in humans.', 'Yes, with many limitations There is a cohort study on humans on this question: In 2010, a first evaluation looked at the influence of 20 vitamins or dietary supplements on life expectancy [3]; of these 20 only glucosamine and chondroitin showed a possible relationship with life expectancy.', 'The researchers speculate that glucosamine prolongs life expectancy just as was found in aspirin [2].', 'Until then, the life-prolonging effect of glucosamine remains optimistic speculation with little evidence.']",0,"The research indicates that while glucosamine has shown potential to extend lifespan in nematodes and mice, the evidence for its effect on human life expectancy remains speculative and limited.","Although research here is still in its infancy and there is only one cohort study in humans besides basic studies, this shows possible effects.

However, current evidence for reliable and long-term efficacy is generally lacking, and most remedies are not well studied. It is therefore not possible to lump all products together. Preparations containing the plant ingredient beta-sitosterol, extracts of the African plum tree or ryegrass pollen extract could possibly lead to some improvement - however, this cautious assumption is based on outdated data. However, the current finding is this: remedies containing saw palmetto do not work any better than placebo and are thus considered ineffective."
Are there medical benefits to wearing a bra?,"['No evidence that a bra changes the breast In our extensive searches, we only received one piece of work on the subject: in 1990 eleven women in Japan were examined how the consistent wearing of a strong supportive bra affects [1].', 'A change in shape of the chest by bras is thus not proven, just as no health benefits by omitting a bra.', 'Instead, we found the opposite recommendation: women who occasionally suffer from aching breasts could allegedly get relief with a well-seated bra [5-7].', 'Whether wearing a bra helps against aching breasts is scientifically unproven.', 'Also the studies, on the basis of which it is recommended to wear a well-seated bra in a painful breasts, are not meaningful: In a work already over 40 years old 114 women with a painful breast got to wear a well-suited bra, for which they could choose from 144 different sizes [2].']",1,"The provided sentences indicate that there is no conclusive evidence supporting the claim that wearing a bra has medical benefits, as studies have not proven any significant changes in breast shape or health benefits from wearing or omitting a bra.","Whether it is healthier or even beneficial not to wear a bra cannot be answered due to a lack of studies. Conversely, a few studies claim that well-fitting bras could prevent breast pain. However, the studies are methodologically weak and have virtually no validity."
Do vein preparations for external use help with varicose veins or chronic venous insufficiency?,"['But unfortunately, there is currently no sound scientific evidence that the externally applicable means could alleviate venous ailments [1].', 'Whether varicose veins-contaminated legs help a therapy with cyanoacrylate – a kind of superglue intended to seal the affected vein – is currently unclear, as Medizin-transparent.at has already illuminated in its own article.', 'After most studies focused on symptoms such as itching or tension in the legs, we cannot assess whether the venous products for swallowing could slow the progression of chronic vein weakness.', 'Many questions unresolved Even if venous agents for swallowing should relieve symptoms of varicose veins and vein weakness, many questions remain open: What is the optimal dose for the respective venous agent?']",1,The lack of sound scientific evidence regarding the effectiveness of externally applicable vein preparations for alleviating venous ailments suggests that their role in treating varicose veins or chronic venous insufficiency remains uncertain.,"At present, it is not possible to assess the efficacy of ointments, gels or creams because studies on these products are lacking. The situation is different for vein remedies to be swallowed. Studies suggest that some may improve symptoms of varicose veins or chronic venous insufficiency, such as itching, restless or swollen legs, pain and cramps. Quite likely, the remedies are likely to help with water retention in the legs (edema) caused by venous disease. However, better-done, more extensive, and longer-running studies are needed to confidently assess the efficacy of vein remedies for swallowing."
Do milk or dairy products promote bladder cancer?,"['Intestinal cancer and bladder cancer risk reduced For some types of cancer, the consumption of large amounts of milk and dairy products seems to be able to reduce the risk of cancer.', 'At least for cancer in the colon and the rectum, the results show a direct connection with the amount of milk product: the more milk and dairy products the study participants consumed, the greater the protection effect.', 'A potentially increased prostate risk due to very high milk and dairy consumption is thus opposed to a likely reduction in the risk of colorectal cancer.']",2,"The sentences indicate that while high consumption of milk and dairy products may reduce the risk of certain cancers, there is no direct evidence linking them to an increased risk of bladder cancer specifically.","It is likely that dairy products reduce the risk of colon and rectal cancer, and possibly bladder cancer. However, very large amounts of milk & dairy products could possibly increase the risk of prostate cancer. It should be remembered that about the same number of men die from colon and rectal cancer as from prostate cancer. For breast and ovarian cancer and cancer of the endometrium, it is unclear whether cancer risk is affected by milk and dairy products."
Do milk or dairy products promote prostate cancer?,"['Intestinal cancer and bladder cancer risk reduced For some types of cancer, the consumption of large amounts of milk and dairy products seems to be able to reduce the risk of cancer.', 'Men who claimed to have consumed a great deal of milk and dairy products have, over the years, been less likely to have these types of cancer than men who had little milk-containing food.', 'At least for cancer in the colon and the rectum, the results show a direct connection with the amount of milk product: the more milk and dairy products the study participants consumed, the greater the protection effect.', 'A potentially increased prostate risk due to very high milk and dairy consumption is thus opposed to a likely reduction in the risk of colorectal cancer.', 'There is also the possibility that dairy products will reduce the likelihood of bladder cancer.']",0,"The sentences indicate that while high consumption of milk and dairy products may potentially increase the risk of prostate cancer, they also suggest a protective effect against other types of cancer, particularly colorectal cancer, which complicates the relationship between dairy consumption and prostate cancer risk.","It is likely that dairy products reduce the risk of colon and rectal cancer, and possibly bladder cancer. However, very large amounts of milk & dairy products could possibly increase the risk of prostate cancer. It should be remembered that about the same number of men die from colon and rectal cancer as from prostate cancer.

Do green tea products provide effective and safe support for weight loss?,"['This is too short to judge the long-term success of weight loss.', 'Overall, for the authors of this systematic survey, it remains questionable whether the investigated plant extracts can help with long-term weight loss and are also safe.', '[12] So there is no good evidence that at least the food supplements listed here can provide significant support in weight loss.']",2,"The sentences indicate a lack of strong evidence supporting the effectiveness and safety of green tea products for long-term weight loss, suggesting that their role in weight loss remains questionable.","Due to the number of studies, it is unclear for a number of supposedly appetite-suppressing dietary supplements whether they can support successful weight loss. Well-done studies that run over a long period of time with a sufficient number of test subjects are scarce. Evidence for long-term safety and simultaneous efficacy is therefore lacking."
Can monk's pepper help with cycle disorders?,"['The summarized study results indicate that the symptoms with monk pepper are reduced in more patients than with a sham medication (placebo).', 'However, these results are not well-secured.', 'Whether monk peppers can help with such cycle disorders is simply not researched meaningfully.', 'We could not find reliable studies that investigated this question (see studies in detail).', 'However, whether this can reduce the symptoms is not well studied [4].']",1,"The sentences indicate that while there are some results suggesting monk's pepper may reduce symptoms, the overall research is insufficient and lacks reliable studies to confirm its effectiveness for cycle disorders.","In the studies to date, monk's pepper seems to relieve PMS symptoms better than a placebo. However, this is not well proven, because the studies have significant weaknesses. There is no evidence of an effect on menstrual disorders. Significant studies are lacking."
Does brisk walking lower mortality? Is some exercise better than none at all?,"['==References==<br> According to their calculations, 75 minutes of brisk walking a week can extend life by 1.8 years.', 'For participants with a movement time up to 75 minutes of brisk walking per week, mortality fell by around 20 percent – in the model calculation this corresponds to 1.8 years.', 'In both normal and overweight people, mortality decreased when the researchers compared slightly active (equivalent to approximately 140 minutes of brisk walking per week) with inactive people.']",0,"The sentences indicate that brisk walking can significantly reduce mortality rates, suggesting that some exercise, such as 75 minutes of brisk walking per week, is indeed beneficial compared to being inactive.","Several major studies have consistently concluded that physical activity reduces mortality. Even a brisk walk is enough. More helps more - but in any case, some exercise is much better than none at all."
Can arthroscopy reduce pain or improve mobility?,"['Studies clearly speak against a benefit A research team summarized the most meaningful of all previously published studies on arthroscopy in knee arthritis.', 'In these studies, patients treated after arthroscopy had no noticeably less pain or movement restrictions than those treated only for appearance or not at all.', 'Arthroscopy against osteoarthritis: not effective, but also not very risky After all: Undesirable events were not conspicuously common in the arthroscopy groups either.']",2,The provided sentences indicate that studies show no significant improvement in pain or mobility for patients undergoing arthroscopy compared to those receiving other treatments or no treatment at all.,The data are clear: Arthroscopy is useless as a treatment for knee osteoarthritis. It can neither relieve pain nor improve the function of the knee joint in the long term.
Do health benefits increase with duration and intensity of exercise?,"['==References==<br> According to their calculations, 75 minutes of brisk walking a week can extend life by 1.8 years.', 'In both normal and overweight people, mortality decreased when the researchers compared slightly active (equivalent to approximately 140 minutes of brisk walking per week) with inactive people.', 'In this study, too, a gain in years of life was calculated, but here in relation to the time of birth: Compared to inactive people, slight activity prolongs life by 0.7 years.', '150 minutes of physical activity per week reduced mortality by around 9 percent.', 'less than 150 minutes per week, can reduce their risk of death by around 34% compared to inactive people.']",0,"The sentences indicate that increased physical activity correlates with reduced mortality rates, suggesting that health benefits may indeed increase with both the duration and intensity of exercise.","Several major studies have consistently concluded that physical activity reduces mortality. Even a brisk walk is enough. More helps more - but in any case, some exercise is much better than none at all."
