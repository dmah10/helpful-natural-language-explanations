Is the homeopathic remedy Neradin effective for erectile dysfunction?,"['No studies on Neradin Also our search for studies on the product Neradin remained resultless.', 'Studies on the product Neradin also appear to be missing.']",1,"The claim that Neradin is effective for erectile dysfunction lacks evidence, as searches for studies on the product yielded no results, suggesting that its efficacy has not been scientifically demonstrated.","The extract from the Damiana plant (Turnera diffusa) is advertised as a remedy for erectile dysfunction for men. However, this claimed effect on potency is by no means proven. It has apparently never been tested on humans. This also applies to homeopathic remedies such as the product Neradin."
Can the so-called Tupler technique help against rectus diastasis?,"['No studies on the Tupler technique As intense as we were looking for, we could not find the promised studies on the Tupler technique.', 'The claim that this is a scientifically proven therapy for rectus diastase is therefore simply wrong.', 'The studies in detail We did not find any studies that investigated the effectiveness of the Tupler technique for the treatment of rectus diastase.']",1,"The claim that the Tupler technique can help against rectus diastasis is unsubstantiated due to the absence of any studies investigating its effectiveness for this purpose, rendering the claim scientifically unproven.",We could not find a single study that examined whether the Tupler technique actually works. And this despite the fact that providers of the method advertise that its effectiveness is scientifically proven.
Does arthroscopy (joint endoscopy) help with osteoarthritis of the knee joint?,"['What might sound logical, however, has a catch: the arthroscopy of osteoarthritis does nothing to the treated person.', 'Studies clearly speak against a benefit A research team summarized the most meaningful of all previously published studies on arthroscopy in knee arthritis.', 'In these studies, patients treated after arthroscopy had no noticeably less pain or movement restrictions than those treated only for appearance or not at all.', 'Arthroscopy against osteoarthritis: not effective, but also not very risky After all: Undesirable events were not conspicuously common in the arthroscopy groups either.']",2,The claim that arthroscopy helps with osteoarthritis of the knee joint is disputed by studies that found no noticeable difference in pain or movement restrictions between patients who underwent arthroscopy and those who did not.,The data are clear: Arthroscopy is useless as a treatment for knee osteoarthritis. It can neither relieve pain nor improve the function of the knee joint in the long term.
"Do dietary supplements containing silicon (e.g. as ""organic silicon"" or silica) have health benefits?","['So far it is also completely unclear what role the element silicon plays in the human body at all [8].', 'We have researched: Previous studies do not provide any evidence that dietary supplements with silicon support bone build-up and thus protect older women from osteoporosis and bone fractures in old age [1,2].', 'There is no evidence that silicon improves the hair structure [3,4], strengthens the fingernails [4] or makes the skin more beautiful and elastic [4,6,7].', 'Also that silicon supports the formation of collagen and connective tissue is only a conjecture [8].', 'Conjectures without studies Neither we nor the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) [8] were able to find clinical studies on any other alleged health benefits of silicon.']",1,"The claim that dietary supplements containing silicon have health benefits is unsubstantiated, as existing research fails to provide evidence for its benefits on bone build-up, hair structure, fingernail strength, skin elasticity, collagen formation, and other alleged health benefits.","There is no evidence so far that the additional intake of silicon can promote health. Also that it strengthens nails, skin and hair is an unsubstantiated claim. Moreover, it is unclear whether silicon plays any role at all in the body."
Can regular intake of cranberry juice or cranberry extract prevent recurrent cystitis in women?,"['The summarized results show that the regular intake of cranberry products could have a preventive effect.', 'There is also only evidence that cranberry products can prevent bladder inflammation for otherwise healthy women.', 'Overall, there is evidence of a possible preventive effect of cranberry.']",0,"The claim that regular intake of cranberry juice or cranberry extract can prevent recurrent cystitis in women is supported by the summarized results showing a preventive effect and evidence of a possible preventive effect, specifically for otherwise healthy women.","Women who repeatedly have to deal with bladder infections might become ill somewhat less frequently if they regularly take cranberry juice or extract. However, this is not well established. And it only applies to uncomplicated bladder infections in otherwise healthy women. Whether cranberry products help when cystitis is already present remains unclear. This has not yet been investigated in meaningful studies."
Does covid vaccination reduce the likelihood of getting long-lasting symptoms (long covid) in case of corona infection?,"['Long-Covid risk with low vaccination Two studies [1,2] suggest that the long-covid risk is likely to be lower if vaccinated twice: In one of these studies with Corona infected [1], twice vaccinated patients reported 40 to 50 percent less likely to be affected by Long Covid compared to non-vaccinated patients.', 'Results Two-fold Vaccinated people reported to be affected by long-covid symptoms only about half as often as non-vaccinated people.']",0,"The claim that covid vaccination reduces the likelihood of getting long-lasting symptoms is supported by the studies, which found that twice-vaccinated patients reported 40 to 50 percent less likelihood of being affected by Long Covid compared to non-vaccinated patients.","If twice-vaccinated people are infected, their risk of later being affected by Long Covid may be only half that of non-vaccinated people. Since there is no clear definition of long covid, the protective effect cannot be precisely quantified."
Can the preventive intake of lysine prevent cold sores (lip herpes) and genital herpes? Can lysine help when the blisters are already there?,"['You cannot answer whether preventively taken lysine can prevent herpes, or whether it helps if the blisters are already there.', ""So the lysine didn't seem to have any effect."", 'Does a higher dose of lysine work better than a lower dose?', 'Results Overall, the participants had no less frequent herpes, whether they were taking high-dose lysine, low-dose lysine or placebo.', 'Results The results are ambiguous and do not allow for certain conclusions: both the Lysin group and the placebo group were less likely to have lip herpes after 6 months.']",1,"The claim that preventive intake of lysine can prevent cold sores and genital herpes is uncertain due to conflicting results, with some studies showing no effect of lysine on herpes frequency and others indicating ambiguous results that do not allow for certain conclusions.",Research is coming up with inconclusive and contradictory results. All available studies are small and of unclear quality. We could not say whether lysine protects against herpes or can alleviate it.
"Do hormonal contraceptives to swallow (the ""pill"") affect endurance performance in women?","['The conclusion of the work: Women taking the pill could actually have a minor disadvantage in sports.', 'Specifically, women with a pill may absorb less oxygen during training and are out of breath faster.', 'Possibly a slightly lower performance through the pill â€“ to this conclusion also came another current overview work [2].']",0,"The claim that hormonal contraceptives affect endurance performance in women is supported by the findings that women taking the pill may absorb less oxygen during training and experience faster breathlessness, potentially leading to a minor disadvantage in sports.","Taking the pill could possibly impair endurance performance in sports somewhat. However, there are no indications of less muscle strength due to the pill. However, these - somewhat contradictory - findings are anything but certain. Whether the somewhat reduced endurance performance speaks against contraception with the pill, each athlete must decide for herself - depending on how important top athletic performance is for her."
Does whole-body cryotherapy in the cold chamber improve health?,"['Moreover, they cannot ensure that alleged improvements are really due to the cold chamber.', 'Based on these data, it is impossible to assess whether whole-body cooling therapy is effective and useful in different health problems.', 'However, none of the studies can prove the effectiveness of the cold chamber treatment, because everyone lacks meaningfulness.']",1,The claim that whole-body cryotherapy in the cold chamber improves health is uncertain because the existing studies lack meaningfulness and cannot establish a causal link between the treatment and alleged improvements.,"Studies published so far are of low quality and therefore not conclusive. The effectiveness of the cold chamber has not been proven for either physical or psychological complaints. There is also no evidence of effectiveness in sports, for example for sore muscles or for a hoped-for increase in athletic performance."
Can low-level laser therapy reduce pain from knee or hip osteoarthritis?,"['According to the research team behind the review, the study situation for low-level laser therapy in knee arthrosis is not sufficient to confirm or exclude efficacy.', 'This was not the case, the laser treatment could not relieve the pain better than placebo treatment.']",1,The claim that low-level laser therapy can reduce pain from knee or hip osteoarthritis is uncertain due to the insufficient study situation and the failure of laser treatment to relieve pain better than placebo treatment in the reviewed research.,"In the pain treatment of wrist osteoarthritis, no efficacy can be assumed - this is indicated by the results of a small but well-done study. Research results on knee osteoarthritis are contradictory and therefore of little significance. We did not find any reliable studies on hip osteoarthritis."
"Do mouth rinses with hydroxyapatite, for example the products ""Linola sept mouth rinse"" and ""Karex Abwehr"", protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection?","['In our search in three different scientific databases, we did not find any studies that investigated the supposed anti-coronavirus effect of the mouthwashes ""Linola sept"" and ""Karex Defense"".', 'However, it is questionable whether patients have become healthy faster and this has not been studied.', 'For the claim that mouthwashes with hydroxyapatite could avoid corona infections, there is no scientific evidence.', 'Our conclusion: Scientific evidence of an effect of mouthwashes against Corona infections is missing.', 'We could not find any studies that investigated whether Covid-19 patients would recover faster if they gurgled with hydroxyapatite solutions.']",1,"The claim that mouth rinses with hydroxyapatite, such as ""Linola sept mouth rinse"" and ""Karex Abwehr"", protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection lacks scientific evidence, as no studies have been found to investigate their anti-coronavirus effect or their impact on the recovery rate of Covid-19 patients.","There are no studies on the anti-corona effect of hydroxyapatite-containing mouth rinses such as ""Linola sept"" or ""Karex Abwehr"". We found no studies on the products themselves or on the alleged active ingredient hydroxyapatite. The claimed mechanism of action is not plausible."
Does CBD or cannabis use protect against covid-19 disease???,"['No studies on CBD as covid protection We cannot answer whether the regular intake of CBD can prevent a Covid-19 disease, which has not yet been investigated.', 'Although she appears in some media reports, the report is simply wrong that the researchers had demonstrated an anti-corona effect of CBD in their study: According to the research team, CBD had no effect on the corona virus in the experiments.', 'Also, it appears that the regular intake of cannabinoids such as CBD can prevent covid-19 disease has not been studied.']",1,"The claim that CBD or cannabis use protects against Covid-19 disease is unsubstantiated as there are no studies that have investigated its preventative effects, and existing research has found no evidence of CBD having an anti-corona effect.","CBD is unlikely to have any effect on the symptoms of covid-19 disease. This is the conclusion of the only study that has investigated this. However, its validity is somewhat limited due to the small number of participants. Not explored is a possible preventive effect. It is unclear whether CBD or other cannabis constituents - ingested or smoked - protect against corona infection or covid-19 disease."
Does taking taiga root extract strengthen the immune system? Can it make vaccinations more effective or tolerable?,"['Taiga Root and Immune Defense: Extensive Studies Missing In our extensive research, we have not found any studies that can demonstrate an immune-strengthening effect of the Taiga Root.', 'However, the studies were too small and inadequate for reliable results.', 'Whether the taiga root is beneficial to the immune defense can not be proven at the present time â€“ but also cannot be ruled out.', 'The two available studies also do not provide any information on whether taiga root extract could even make vaccinations more effective.']",1,"The claim that taking taiga root extract strengthens the immune system and makes vaccinations more effective or tolerable is uncertain due to the lack of extensive studies and reliable results, leaving the potential benefits unproven but not entirely ruled out.",The alleged immune-strengthening effect of taiga root (also called Siberian ginseng) has apparently never been investigated in appropriate studies. The positive effect claimed by dietary supplement manufacturers after vaccinations is also not proven.
Does short-term fasting improve quality of life in cancer?,"['On this basis, we cannot reliably say whether fasting during chemotherapy is actually useful or not, thus reducing side effects and improving the quality of life.', 'In terms of quality of life, there are already contradictions within the individual studies: in the study [1b], in which the participants switched between fasting and non-fasting after half of the chemotherapy, only in one group did the quality of life improve during fasting, in the other the quality of life did not improve.', 'Whether this is actually noticeable for cancer patients remains questionable.']",1,The claim that short-term fasting improves quality of life in cancer is uncertain due to inconsistent results within individual studies and questionable noticeability for cancer patients.,We found only three very small studies on both questions. Their results are so unreliable that we cannot make any assessment. So we cannot say whether the quality of life of those affected is improved and whether fasting during chemotherapy reduces side effects.
Does zinc preventively protect against covid-19 disease???,"['A preventive effect has not yet been researched in a single study.', 'It is therefore unclear whether the preventive use of zinc preparations protects against an infection with SARS-CoV-2 or a Covid-19 disease.']",1,"The claim that zinc preventively protects against Covid-19 disease is uncertain because existing research has not investigated its preventive effect, leaving unclear whether zinc preparations can protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection or Covid-19 disease.",The results of two studies on this suggest that sufferers with Covid-19 do not recover more quickly with zinc than without. A preventive effect has not yet been investigated in studies.
Do agents containing uridine and/or cytidine improve the symptoms of polyneuropathy?,"['Despite searching in three large databases, we have not been able to find any studies that met these criteria.', 'Whether drugs with uridine and/or cytidine actually help with polyneuropathia, we cannot estimate on this basis.']",1,The claim that agents containing uridine and/or cytidine improve the symptoms of polyneuropathy cannot be supported or refuted due to the lack of relevant studies that meet the specified criteria.,We have not been able to find any meaningful studies on this question.
Do saw palmetto preparations improve the symptoms of benign enlarged prostate (benign prostatic hyperplasia) in the longer term compared to placebo?,"['No better than placebo The two systematic overviews [1,2] come to the conclusion in the summary in agreement: The saw palm preparations do not relieve prostate problems better than a sham medication.', 'In other studies that tested saw palm as an addition to tamsulosin, the addition of saw palm did not bring any extra benefit.']",2,The claim that saw palmetto preparations improve symptoms of benign enlarged prostate in the longer term is disputed by systematic overviews and additional studies that found no significant benefits compared to a placebo or when added to other treatments.,"According to current studies, remedies with saw palmetto do not improve the symptoms of a benign enlarged prostate in the longer term more than a placebo. This assessment is well supported."
Can capsules or tablets with lactase improve the symptoms of lactose intolerance and make dairy products more tolerable?,"['The magnitude of the effect of lactase and the noticeable improvement of symptoms cannot be derived from all studies.', 'Fewer symptoms with lactase In five studies, the participants from the lactase group reported a total of fewer complaints [2-4.6.7].', 'In only one study [4], the participants reported a marked improvement after taking lactase â€“ their symptoms were only half as severe.', 'Lactase tablets and capsules may make dairy products at least slightly more compatible with lactose intolerance.']",0,"The claim that lactase capsules or tablets can improve lactose intolerance symptoms and make dairy products more tolerable is supported by the studies mentioned, which consistently report fewer symptoms and improved tolerance with lactase supplementation, although the magnitude of the effect varies.","Tablets and capsules containing the enzyme lactase may alleviate the symptoms of lactose intolerance. It is unclear whether those affected feel the effect clearly. Our assessment is not well substantiated. The studies published to date are very small and, for the most part, poorly conducted."
Do oral zinc supplements prevent a cold???,['We have found that preparations with zinc for oral use â€“ such as lozenges â€“ do not cast away the annoying colds.'],1,"The claim that oral zinc supplements prevent a cold is contradicted by the statement that preparations with zinc for oral use, such as lozenges, do not eliminate colds.","It is possible that oral zinc supplements may slightly shorten the duration of a cold in adults. However, many details concerning efficacy and safety are still unclear. Studies to date cannot answer the question of whether zinc also has a preventive effect - they are not conclusive enough."
Do you get a stomach ache if you eat cherries or other stone fruit and then drink water?,"['Research does not seem to be particularly concerned about the potential risk of this food combination.', 'In any case, we could not find a single study on the subject in our elaborate research.', 'In short, there are no scientific studies that show that drinking water after eating cherries causes discomfort.', 'But this explanation does not seem particularly plausible for the cherries-water myth: On the one hand, the ""problem of short-term gastric acid dilution not only arises with water [6].']",1,"The claim that eating cherries or stone fruit and then drinking water causes a stomach ache is unsubstantiated by scientific evidence, as no studies have been found to support this assertion, and the proposed explanation for the discomfort is implausible.",We found no scientific studies or documented case reports showing that drinking water after eating cherries causes discomfort.
Is ivermectin an effective drug for treating covid 19 disease?,"[""According to previous studies, probably wrong: Ivermectin may not have a noticeable effect on a Covid-19 disease: it does not seem to alleviate the disease's symptoms."", 'Both the European Supervisory Authority EMA (European Medical Agency) and the World Health Organization WHO currently advise against the use of ivermectin for the treatment of Covid-19 (as of July 2021) [6,7].', 'There was no difference between the ivermectin and placebo groups â€“ therefore, ivermectin does not seem to help to mitigate the symptoms typical of Covid-19.']",2,"The claim that ivermectin is an effective drug for treating Covid-19 disease is challenged by the lack of noticeable effect on alleviating symptoms, as well as advisories from reputable health organizations and study results showing no difference between ivermectin and placebo groups.","Studies to date suggest that ivermectin does not mitigate covid-19. There is also no evidence that the drug can prevent deaths from covid-19. However, a possible beneficial effect cannot be ruled out with certainty either. Larger studies would be needed for this."
"Does a nasal spray with carrageenan from red algae relieve discomfort from a cold (""chill"")?","['Relieving little likely And what if you are already ill and the cooling is full of ""blooming up""?', 'However, it is doubtful that this effect is so great that it makes a noticeable difference for people with a cold.', 'That cold sprays with red algae carragees actually have a great benefit in colds is therefore not likely.']",2,The claim that a nasal spray with carrageenan from red algae relieves discomfort from a cold is doubtful because the sentences suggest that any potential effect is unlikely to make a noticeable difference for people with a cold.,Such a nasal spray is unlikely to significantly alleviate cold symptoms or shorten the duration of the cold. Whether the spray can in principle protect against a cold has not yet been researched.
Does a nasal spray with carrageenan from red algae prevent colds?,"['Preventive effect unclear As far as the theory is concerned.', 'Avoiding contagion Overall, the possibilities for preventing a cold are limited.', 'Because in most cases, the worst is over after a week.The studies in detail To prevent colds, we could not find any studies in our research.']",1,"The claim that a nasal spray with carrageenan from red algae prevents colds is uncertain because the available information does not provide conclusive evidence to support its preventive effect, and existing studies do not demonstrate its efficacy in preventing colds.",Such a nasal spray is unlikely to significantly alleviate cold symptoms or shorten the duration of the cold. Whether the spray can in principle protect against a cold has not yet been researched.
Does MMS help with an infection with the coronavirus (Covid-19)?,"['No meaningful studies on MMS There is no evidence that MMS can cure diseases or relieve discomfort.', 'The fact that MMS helps with Covid-19 remains an unreserved claim.', 'However, there is not the slightest indication that MMS could help against cancer or any other disease such as an infection with coronaviruses.']",1,"The claim that MMS helps with an infection with the coronavirus (Covid-19) is unsubstantiated as there is no evidence to support it, and multiple statements assert that MMS has not been shown to cure diseases or relieve discomfort, including infections with coronaviruses.","Experts around the world warn against the use of MMS. In several cases, the agent has caused severe poisoning. Claims about a healing effect are untenable rumors. There is no evidence that the substance is effective against autism, malaria, cancer, AIDS or hepatitis, or that it helps with an infection with the coronavirus (Covid-19)."
Can inhalation with budesonide spray relieve symptoms of covid-19?,"['The cortisone preparation Budesonide can alleviate the symptoms of a Covid-19 disease and significantly reduce hospital intakes â€“ according to a recently published study from Oxford [1].', 'No difference in hospital stays In the larger study [2] the participants of the Budesonide group also reported slightly less severe complaints than the comparison group without Budesonide.', 'The study results currently available indicate a potential positive effect of budesonide in Covid-19.']",0,"The claim that inhalation with budesonide spray can relieve symptoms of Covid-19 is supported by the study results, which indicate a potential positive effect of budesonide in Covid-19 and show that participants who received budesonide reported less severe complaints and had reduced hospital intakes.","In mild covid-19 disease, the cortisone preparation budesonide may be able to alleviate symptoms somewhat and make patients feel better more quickly. However, these results are not well established. The study results available to date cannot reliably answer the question of whether patients with budesonide also need to be hospitalized less often. It is also unclear whether budesonide can also help severely ill patients or prevent deaths caused by Covid-19."
Does hydroxychloroquine prevent covid-19 infection???,"['And they are as clear as disappointing: therefore hydroxychloroquine can do nothing against the corona virus.', 'Not suitable for prevention Even a preventive effect does not indicate anything: In studies with healthy individuals, the number of participants who regularly take hydroxychloroquine as well as those without medication [2] was similar.', 'The preventive use of hydroxychloroquine could not protect the subjects from a Covid-19 disease.']",2,The claim that hydroxychloroquine prevents Covid-19 infection is contradicted by the evidence that studies with healthy individuals showed no difference in Covid-19 cases between those taking hydroxychloroquine and those without medication.,"The results of all studies to date preclude hydroxychloroquine from preventing deaths in covid-19 patients. The drug also does not appear to attenuate the disease. A preventive effect is also unlikely, according to the study results. It is well documented that hydroxychloroquine has side effects. Among other things, the drug can damage the heart and kidneys."
Can vitamin C prevent infection with coronavirus or prevent deaths from covid-19?,"['The comparison of the two groups does not indicate that vitamin C can prevent deaths from Covid-19.', 'It is therefore unexplored whether vitamin C can reduce the risk of coronavirus infection.']",1,"The claim that vitamin C can prevent infection with coronavirus or prevent deaths from covid-19 is not supported by the evidence, as the comparison of the two groups does not indicate a preventive effect on deaths from Covid-19, and the potential impact on infection risk remains unexplored.",Studies to date are inconclusive. There is no evidence that high-dose vitamin C infusions reduce the risk of dying from covid-19. A preventive effect has not been researched at all.
Does treatment with cortisone-like drugs such as dexamethasone ensure that more critically ill patients survive Covid 19 disease?,"['They have found out that the remedies actually have a benefit â€“ even if not for all patients.', 'Only in case of severe progression In case of a serious or even life-threatening course of disease, treatment with cortisone-like medications can reduce mortality in addition to the usual (intensive) measures.', 'With additional cortisone treatment 328 out of 1000 people die with the usual treatment 415 out of 1000 people Cortisone treatment thus saves about 87 out of 1000 people with critical Covid19 disease.', 'In case of severe covid-19 disease, 267 out of 1000 people die with additional cortisone treatment with the usual treatment 334 out of 1000 people Cortisone treatment thus saves about 67 out of 1000 people with severe covid-19 disease.']",0,"The claim that treatment with cortisone-like drugs ensures more critically ill patients survive Covid-19 disease is supported by the evidence that cortisone treatment reduces mortality in severe and critical Covid-19 cases, saving around 67-87 lives out of 1000 people.","In severe or even life-threatening covid-19 disease, cortisone-like medications can save lives. In non-severe covid-19 disease, this has not been proven. Here, there is even evidence that mortality may be higher."
Does sugar substitution increase the risk of developing or dying from cancer?,"['No definitive results On erythritol and similar sugar alternatives (so-called sugar alcohols) we could not find any meaningful studies that investigated the association with cancer.', 'In most studies, there was no clear connection: people who consumed, fell ill or died more frequently from cancer than people who used little, rare or never sweeteners.', 'In spite of the large number of studies and participants, we are therefore currently unable to assess conclusively whether sweeteners actually increase the risk of cancer.', 'We could not find a single comparative study on sugar alcohols such as erythritol, which investigated the relationship between this sweetener group and cancer.', 'Results not clear In the review of the individual studies [1] and in the majority of recent studies [3-5], there is no clear link between the consumption of sweeteners and the risk of developing or dying of cancer.']",1,"The claim that sugar substitution increases the risk of developing or dying from cancer is uncertain due to the lack of definitive results and clear connections in existing studies, with most research finding no conclusive link between sweetener consumption and cancer risk.","Most studies on sweeteners such as aspartame and cyclamate find no clear link. However, they all have major flaws, so the question cannot be answered with certainty at present. We were unable to find any meaningful studies at all on other sugar alternatives such as erythritol and xylitol."
Are international travel restrictions and border health checks effective in curbing the spread of covid-19?,"['Some studies conclude that screenings at the border may be helpful to slow down the impact of the outbreak and reduce deaths a little.', 'Rather, their evaluations would suggest that some travel-related control measures in the event of outbreaks of COVID-19, but also SARS and MERS, could have a positive impact on the outcome of the infection.']",0,"The claim that international travel restrictions and border health checks are effective in curbing the spread of COVID-19 is supported by studies suggesting that such measures can slow down the impact of the outbreak and reduce deaths, as well as evaluations indicating a positive impact on the outcome of the infection.","It may be that travel-related control measures lead to a reduction in the ""import"" and ""export"" of infections across borders. It could also be that the number of infected people increases more slowly. Health checks at the border could also identify previously undetected infections - but whether this will put a real damper on the pandemic is certainly questionable."
Does denosumab (Prolia) reduce the risk of vertebral fractures in osteoporosis?,"['Denosumab was able to prevent such vertebral fractures in about 1 out of 100 female participants.', 'Compared to some other osteoporosis agents, denosumab seems to be able to prevent vertebral fractures in some cases.']",0,The claim that denosumab reduces the risk of vertebral fractures in osteoporosis is supported by the evidence that it can prevent such fractures in a significant proportion of female participants and appears to be effective in some cases compared to other osteoporosis agents.,The pooled results of studies to date show that denosumab reduces the risk of vertebral fractures more than a placebo. It may even be slightly more protective than single other osteoporosis drugs.  It cannot be ruled out that discontinuing denosumab increases the likelihood of vertebral fractures again. The studies on this are contradictory.
Does a ketogenic diet help against cancer?,"['So far, there is no evidence of the efficacy of the ketogenic diet in cancer.', 'Effect on tumors so far unexplored This means that until today, the question that is actually relevant to cancer patients â€“ whether low-carbohydrate or non-carbohydrate diets can do something about cancer cells â€“ has hardly been investigated in humans.', 'The few studies available so far do not report any or at most an unsafe anti-cancer effect of the ketogenic diet.']",1,"The claim that a ketogenic diet helps against cancer is uncertain due to the lack of evidence and limited human studies, which have so far yielded inconclusive or unsafe anti-cancer effects.","To date, there are no well-done studies that have examined the effect of a ketogenic diet on cancer in humans. This involves eating little or no carbohydrates and sugar, but plenty of protein and fat. Experts take a critical view of ""cancer diets"" such as the ketogenic diet - they can also be dangerous."
Can a special mattress relieve nighttime rheumatism symptoms and thus improve sleep?,"['Many mattresses, no studies To this end, we have searched in several scientific databases for studies on rheumatism and mattresses â€“ but without success.', 'It is currently impossible to answer whether a specific mattress can help those affected.', 'The studies in detail We could not find any studies that investigated the effect of mattresses on rheumatism pain.']",1,The claim that a special mattress can relieve nighttime rheumatism symptoms and improve sleep remains unsubstantiated due to the lack of scientific studies investigating the effect of mattresses on rheumatism pain.,"During our research, we did not find any scientific studies on this. Therefore, we can not make any statement about the effect of special mattresses."
Can induction of labor prevent infant deaths in pregnancies that go beyond the estimated due date? Does it reduce the number of neonatal intensive care unit stays?,"['The most important results: Birth initiations can be lifesaving for babies.', 'In the case of inductions, there are fewer deaths of babies immediately before or after birth than during observation and waiting.', 'Due to the artificial triggering of the birth a little less stays in an intensive care unit are necessary for the newborns.']",0,The claim that inducing labor can prevent infant deaths and reduce neonatal intensive care unit stays is supported by the findings that birth initiations can be lifesaving for babies and result in fewer deaths and intensive care unit stays.,"The summary of 34 strong studies involving 21,500 women shows that birth inductions can prevent baby deaths and neonatal intensive care unit stays - compared to observational waiting. Cesarean sections are likely to be needed less often with inductions than with waiting. The use of a suction cup and forceps is unlikely to change much, if at all. The results apply to women with no special risks and in the case that the pregnancy continues beyond the expected delivery date."
Is it safe to take preparations containing unsaponifiable components of avocado and soybean oils (ASU)?,"['Participants taking an ASU preparation reported adverse reactions as frequently (or rarely) as participants in the placebo groups.', 'We consider the result to be trustworthy: Therefore, preparations with ASU are safe.']",0,"The claim that ASU preparations are safe is supported by the fact that participants taking ASU reported adverse reactions at a similar frequency to those in the placebo groups, indicating a lack of significant harm.",There is evidence of minor efficacy of preparations containing avocado and soybean oil (ASU). They can probably somewhat alleviate movement restrictions and pain in osteoarthritis of the knee joint - at least in the short term. An effect in osteoarthritis of the hip joint has not yet been shown. Side effects are not to be expected.
Does taking arginine benefit existing cardiovascular disease or does arginine prevent it from developing?,"['After three months, the results of the two groups were compared and the study authors came to a rather sobering result: In the Arginin group, neither quality of life nor physical resilience of the participants had improved compared to the placebo group.', 'Due to the small number of participants and the short duration of the study, the compatibility of arginine with these data cannot be assessed.', 'From our point of view, it is also questionable how well the results of this study with heart failure sufferers are transferable to people with other types of cardiovascular disease.']",1,"The claim that taking arginine benefits existing cardiovascular disease or prevents it from developing is uncertain due to the lack of improvement in quality of life and physical resilience in the arginine group compared to the placebo group in a three-month study, which is further limited by its small sample size and short duration.","We found only one small study that investigated a benefit that was noticeable for those affected. In patients with heart failure, taking arginine did not improve exercise tolerance or quality of life. Due to a lack of details, we cannot conclusively assess how reliable these results are. Therefore, we cannot make any statements on the benefit of arginine."
Does taking vitamin K lower the risk of other bone fractures in older women?,"['Thus, the intake of vitamin K could save 8 out of 1000 people a bone fracture.', 'However, the estimate for the protective effect of vitamin K is subject to considerable uncertainty â€“ it could also be significantly smaller.', 'Thus, the current study situation suggests that vitamin K â€“ if at all â€“ only to a very small extent protects older women with osteoporosis from bone fractures.']",0,"The claim that taking vitamin K lowers the risk of other bone fractures in older women is uncertain and potentially overstated, as the estimated protective effect of vitamin K is subject to considerable uncertainty and may only provide a very small extent of protection, if any.","Taking vitamin K probably does not reduce the risk of vertebral fractures. However, this assessment is not well supported. The risk of other bone fractures could possibly be reduced - but only slightly. This estimate is also subject to some uncertainty."
"Can supplemental tryptophan, taken as a dietary supplement or with food, help with depression?","['Researched for a long time, but not proven Whether a diet with many tryptophan-rich foods has a beneficial effect on depression, we cannot say.', 'Whether from food or in the form of pills: Whether tryptophan actually relieves the symptoms of depression, the science cannot answer (currently) because of lack of good studies.', 'Although future studies may be able to draw a clearer picture, we do not think it is very likely that tryptophan alone can have great effects.', 'The results can neither show nor refute the effect of tryptophan against depression.', 'Whether or not tryptophan can make antidepressant therapy more effective remains unclear.']",1,"The claim that supplemental tryptophan can help with depression is uncertain due to the lack of good studies and inconclusive results, making it unclear whether tryptophan has a beneficial effect on depression, either when consumed as a dietary supplement or with food.","The amino acid tryptophan appears again and again as a possible treatment for depression. However, an effect could not be scientifically proven so far. Significant studies on tryptophan against depression are lacking."
Do products made from red mold rice have fewer side effects than cholesterol-lowering drugs called statins???,"['""Of course, but not harmless In addition to its positive effects, lovastatin may also cause unpleasant to serious side effects.', 'According to several experts, redhead rice in effect and side effects is too similar to a medicine to go through as a harmless dietary supplement [4,11.12].']",2,"The claim that products made from red mold rice have fewer side effects than statins is challenged by the acknowledgement that lovastatin, a statin, can cause unpleasant to serious side effects, and that redhead rice, which contains lovastatin, is considered by experts to have similar effects and side effects to a medicine, implying it may not be as harmless as claimed.","Red mold rice naturally contains the substance lovastatin, which acts as a cholesterol-lowering agent. The concentration of lovastatin in products made from red mold rice can vary greatly. Therefore, it is not certain that red mold rice is as effective as drugs containing a controlled amount of lovastatin. Depending on the dosage, undesirable side effects from red mold rice are possible - just as with the ""real"" drugs."
Does cat's claw improve joint disease symptoms?,"['Many questions open Whether cat claw helps better in rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis than a placebo cannot be reliably estimated on the basis of the available studies.', ""We can't make any statements about effectiveness."", 'Since both osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis are chronic diseases, no conclusions can be drawn about the longer-term positive and negative effects of cat claws.']",1,"The claim that cat's claw improves joint disease symptoms is uncertain due to the lack of reliable estimates and conclusive evidence from available studies, particularly in distinguishing its effectiveness between rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis.","We found three small studies that investigated cat's claw in patients with rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis. The studies have significant flaws and sometimes come to contradictory results. Therefore, the question cannot be answered unequivocally."
Does platelet-rich plasma therapy (autologous blood therapy) reduce pain in osteoarthritis of the hip joint???,['Knees and hips are the large joints that are particularly affected and for which various injections are offered as therapy.'],2,"The provided sentence does not mention platelet-rich plasma therapy or its effect on pain in osteoarthritis of the hip joint, only mentioning that various injections are offered as therapy for affected joints, which does not provide sufficient evidence to support or refute the claim.","Injections with platelet-rich plasma could slightly reduce pain in osteoarthritis of the knee. The therapy is apparently more effective than placebo treatment, but the effect is small.  For the hip, on the other hand, studies tend to point toward no efficacy. Local side effects are common. Which form of therapy is best for whom has not yet been clarified, and long-term success has not been studied."
"Does EMDR work similarly to exposure therapy, another well-studied form of psychotherapy for the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder???","['Perhaps as effective as established therapy We have also researched how well EMDR therapy works compared to well-established exposure therapy â€“ a common form of psychotherapy for people with post-traumatic stress disorder.', 'There is evidence that EMDR works similarly well as established exposure therapy, i.e.', 'The comparison of EMDR and cognitive behavioral therapy suggests that both forms of therapy help similarly well.']",0,"The claim that EMDR works similarly to exposure therapy is supported by the sentences, which state that EMDR is perhaps as effective as established therapy, works similarly well as exposure therapy, and helps similarly well as cognitive behavioral therapy.",Therapy with EMDR is probably more effective than no therapy at all for people suffering from the psychological consequences of a traumatic experience. Its effectiveness may be similar to that of exposure therapy. This is a widely established and well-studied form of psychotherapy.
Does filling with hydrogel help with chronic back pain caused by a worn disc?,"['And as beautiful as the image of the ""gel-improved intervertebral disc"" may be, the theory is relatively shaky: the wear of the intervertebral disc does not have to be the cause of the back pain, even if it has been detected with X-ray, computer tomopgraphy (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).', 'Nor can the studies prove that Hydrogel can significantly improve the height of the intervertebral discs.', 'However, the studies cannot answer whether the pain would have improved without hydrogel â€“ because none had a control group.']",1,"The claim that filling with hydrogel helps with chronic back pain caused by a worn disc is uncertain because the relationship between disc wear and back pain is unclear, and existing studies fail to demonstrate a clear causal link between hydrogel treatment and improved disc height or pain relief.",None of the studies to date can answer how well the treatment works - they lack conclusiveness for this.

Can maggots accelerate the healing of chronic wounds compared to conventional treatment?,"['Although the thorough cleansing of the wound is important for the healing process [2], there seems to be no indication that wounds heal faster after the maggot treatment [1].', 'Twelve months after the start of treatment, the number of subjects with healed chronic wounds in the maggot group was no greater than in patients with hydrogel associations.']",2,The claim that maggots accelerate the healing of chronic wounds compared to conventional treatment is challenged by the findings that wound healing is not faster with maggot treatment and the number of healed chronic wounds is no greater in the maggot group than in patients with hydrogel associations.,"Maggot therapy may not heal chronic wounds any faster than conventional wound care. However, the maggots seem to be able to clean the wound of dead tissue more quickly - but also cause more pain."
Do antidepressants from the group of serotonin reuptake inhibitors help with depression?,"['Even if not all questions have been finally clarified around the SSRI group, the current study situation has revealed the following: SSRIs are effective.', ""SSRIs are not â€˜happy pills', the effects achieved are rather moderate."", 'SSRI can be helpful in severe and probably also moderate depression.', 'In fact, the study situation with SSRI, as measured by its wide spread, was rather modest over a long period of time.']",0,"The claim that antidepressants from the group of serotonin reuptake inhibitors help with depression is supported by the sentences, which acknowledge the effectiveness of SSRIs in severe and moderate depression, although the effects are moderate and not universally applicable.","Serotonin reuptake inhibitors have been shown to be helpful in more severe depression, although the exact mechanisms are not clear. Overall, very strong or rapid effects are not expected. For milder depression, efficacy is more debatable. Sometimes patients have to try several SSRI preparations until they feel an improvement in symptoms, and some sufferers are not helped by the drugs at all. Well-done studies should help clarify the situation in the future so that more targeted treatment is possible."
Does meditation help against stress?,"['Stress reduction in healthy people is shown, but not whether it is actually due to treatment.', 'A new review [3] summarizes 47 studies and brings better data â€“ even if things remain complicated: Although some forms of meditation work against stress, only in comparison to control groups that receive no other targeted treatment.', 'The authors of an overview of mindfulness-based stress reduction [4] report in their summary that this form of therapy improves mental health, both in healthy people and in some patients with mental illnesses.', 'According to the systematic review work of 2014, not all types of meditation are equally effective: for mindfulness-based meditation, an effectiveness can be demonstrated, but not for transcendental meditation, in which the concentration of attention is sought to dissolve [3].']",0,"The claim that meditation helps against stress is supported by some studies, which show that certain forms of meditation, such as mindfulness-based meditation, can be effective in reducing stress, although the effectiveness varies depending on the type of meditation and the population being studied.","Various forms of meditation seem to be able to alleviate stress both in healthy individuals and in people with mental illness. Studies on this are numerous, but the quality of the studies is consistently unsatisfactory."
Does Cryolipolysis cause noticeable body fat reduction?,"['Whether the method can effectively reduce body fat cannot be said based on its results.', 'Whether the reason for the alleged figure improvements after three to six or twelve months was actually the cold treatment, however, can not be determined by previous-after-comparisons without an untreated control group anyway.', 'Even if the authors of previously published studies conjure the effectiveness of cryolipolysis â€“ this cannot be objectively assessed on the basis of their results.']",1,"The claim that cryolipolysis causes noticeable body fat reduction is uncertain because the existing studies' results are inconclusive and lack a control group, making it impossible to objectively determine the treatment's effectiveness.","The effectiveness of cryolipolysis cannot be assessed objectively, as there are no scientific efficacy studies on it."
Can the active ingredient acetyl salicylic acid (ASA) protect against cancer?,"['Minor reduction in cancer risk According to a recent systematic review [ 1 ], daily intake of ASA actually results in a minor reduction in cancer risk.', 'Among 1000 subjects who took ASA, 16 people died of cancer on average, while those who received only an ineffective dummy medication (placebo) were19.', 'In a cohort study over ten years, the intake of ASA only led to a reduced risk of colorectal cancer every other day, but also to increased gastrointestinal bleeding [5].']",0,"The claim that acetyl salicylic acid (ASA) protects against cancer is supported by the minor reduction in cancer risk observed in a systematic review, but the evidence is limited by the small effect size and potential increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.","Taking ASA daily for several years seems to be able to reduce the risk of dying from cancer somewhat. However, it increases the risk of severe internal bleeding and stomach problems."
Is tick-borne tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) much milder in children than in adults?,"['Although only 20 children participated in this study, there is a certain trend: young patients generally had less severe symptoms and recovered faster than adults.', 'Except for one case of complete vaccination and two cases of incomplete vaccination, the affected children were unvaccinated [11] and more frequently developed meningitis, while adults were more likely to fight with the more dangerous inflammation of the brain and cerebral membranes (meningo-encephalitis).']",0,"The claim that TBE is milder in children than in adults is supported by the study's findings that young patients generally had less severe symptoms and recovered faster than adults, although the unvaccinated children were more likely to develop meningitis.","Current studies suggest that TBE is probably associated with milder symptoms in children than in adults. Permanent damage is also less frequent in younger patients. However, TBE can also have severe health consequences in children in individual cases."
Does condom use cause depression in women?,"['Like any contraceptive method, the condom has disadvantages that it causes depression in women, but is nowhere documented.', 'Maybe less fun We have not found a study that specifically investigated whether the use of condoms in sex can lead to depression in women.', 'If condoms were to promote depression, it would be unlikely that depression would decrease if used more frequently.', 'They have found no correlations between condom use and depression [4].', 'Risk factors for depression In any case, condoms cannot be found in the list of recognised risk factors.']",1,"The claim that condom use causes depression in women is unsubstantiated as there is no documented evidence or study that supports this correlation, and in fact, available research suggests no link between the two.",A study examining exactly this question was not found. Some scientific works with a broad question rather lead to the conclusion that there is no connection between depression and condom use.
Does copper intake increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease?,"[""Because there are no studies that associate an increased uptake of copper directly with an increased Alzheimer's risk [6].""]",1,The claim that copper intake increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease is uncertain because there is a lack of studies that directly link increased copper uptake to an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease.,Some studies claim to have found links between high copper levels and Alzheimer's disease. Whether copper intake actually has an impact on Alzheimer's risk is not clear.
Do special garments with the active ingredient Liporeductyl help against cellulite?,"['An effect could not be found for any active substance [1].', 'Or, to put it more carefully, for none of the innumerable forms of treatment have well-derived scientific evidence that speaks for effectiveness.']",1,The claim that special garments with Liporeductyl help against cellulite is challenged by the lack of scientific evidence supporting the effectiveness of any active substance or treatment for cellulite.,"There are only small studies that neither stand up to methodological criteria nor have been scientifically published. Sustained efficacy has not been proven, which, according to the current status, applies to all common remedies against cellulite."
Does alcohol in moderate amounts prolong life?,"['Alcohol: Beyond good and evil As described in our article on red wine, moderate alcohol consumption probably has a positive effect on cardiovascular health [2]; moderate means an alcoholic drink per day â€“ a small beer or an eighth of wine.']",0,"The claim that moderate alcohol consumption prolongs life is supported by the sentence, which suggests that moderate drinking has a positive effect on cardiovascular health, a key factor in overall longevity.","In moderate amounts, alcohol could reduce the likelihood of dying prematurely. In higher doses, however, it clearly increases this risk. This is unclear for caffeine."
Does light freezing help with weight loss?,"['Much speculation, little knowledge A scientific work taken up by many media does not help with this question [1].', 'Nevertheless, weight loss was not significantly higher than after the same exercise program at more pleasant temperatures.']",1,"The claim that light freezing helps with weight loss is challenged by the finding that weight loss was not significantly higher after exercising in cold temperatures compared to more pleasant temperatures, despite much speculation on the topic.","Some laboratory studies show that the body reacts to colder temperatures with higher energy consumption and burns more fat. Nevertheless, it is completely unclear whether this supports weight loss; that is, whether the process is strong enough and whether other mechanisms do not work against it. Weight loss through freezing has not been investigated in clinical studies."
Does virgin conception exist?,"['Until now, fertilization without sexual contact â€“ biologists refer to it as parthenogenesis â€“ is only known from a few animal species.', 'In humans, the phenomenon is hardly researched, the present study is the only scientific study on this subject so far.']",1,"The claim that virgin conception exists is uncertain because while parthenogenesis has been observed in a few animal species, there is a lack of research on the phenomenon in humans, with only one scientific study on the subject.","To date, only one study has been conducted on this issue.

Can a treatment with singing bowls relieve pain?,"['The participants felt much more relaxed, calmer and better tuned both after the treatment and after the sham treatment.', 'An effect is therefore attributable solely to the placebo effect.']",2,"The claim that singing bowls can relieve pain is challenged by the finding that participants experienced similar relaxation and calmness after both the actual treatment and the sham treatment, suggesting that any perceived pain relief may be due to the placebo effect rather than the treatment itself.",Singing bowl therapy does not appear to be effective for relieving pain.
Does religion promote mental health?,"['Nevertheless, the question is far from clear, for which there are a number of reasons: Hardly any significance religion, religiosity and spirituality can be distinguished from each other and also very difficult to measure.', 'It is almost impossible to bring together the results of the individual studies and, subsequently, the survey work.', 'The term ""religion"" is simply too comprehensive to be judged as a single factor.']",1,"The claim that religion promotes mental health is uncertain due to the ambiguity and complexity of defining and measuring religion, religiosity, and spirituality, making it difficult to draw conclusive results from individual studies.","The studies do not allow any conclusion to be drawn for several reasons: the results are contradictory, only a few studies are by independent authors, and religion is not a concept that is measured uniformly; neither effects nor side effects can be clearly attributed to the factor ""religion"" because there is no such thing as a uniform factor ""religion."""
Does staining brain tumors with the dye aminolevulinic acid before surgery help patients survive longer?,"['Partial success, but increase in survival rate unclear For the use of aminolevulic acid especially in brain tumors, only a larger study was conducted [ 1 ].', 'It is unclear whether the operation with the aid of aminolevulic acid leads to a greater number of long-term cured patients.']",1,"The claim that staining brain tumors with aminolevulinic acid before surgery helps patients survive longer is uncertain due to the lack of conclusive evidence from a single larger study, which only showed partial success without clarifying the impact on long-term survival rates.","Surgery of brain tumors stained with aminolevulinic acid is more complete than without staining. Although the tumor returned in fewer patients in the initial period after surgery, it is unclear whether the long-term survival rate is also greater."
"Can exercise prevent premature deaths from heart attacks, strokes, heart failure, and pre-diabetes as effectively as medication?","['However, the fact that sport alone can reduce the risk of death for people with a heart attack is not entirely certain [1].', 'However, the direct comparison between sports and medications clearly revealed the drug as the winner for people with heart failure: In the long-term use of dewatering drugs (diuretics), only about a quarter of so many patients died early than in regular exercise.', 'Sport beneficial, but no substitute for medication The analysis [1] provides first, cautious results.', 'The authors also point out that studies on sport are missing as an alternative treatment method.', 'It is still too early to say whether sport is suitable for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases or diabetes precursors instead of drugs.']",0,"The claim that exercise can prevent premature deaths from heart attacks, strokes, heart failure, and pre-diabetes as effectively as medication is challenged by the analysis, which suggests that while sport is beneficial, it may not be a suitable substitute for medication, particularly for people with heart failure, and more research is needed to determine its effectiveness as an alternative treatment method.","An evaluation of several meta-analyses provides evidence that exercise can prevent premature death after stroke. After heart attacks or in cases of pre-diabetes, exercise appears to be similarly effective to the corresponding drugs. In the case of heart failure, however, medication is likely to be more effective. However, it is by no means possible to generalize from this that sport can replace medication."
Is the success of conventional treatment of a herniated disc equivalent to that of disc surgery?,"['The pain was shown to decrease faster after surgery than with conventional treatment methods.', 'Intervertebral disc surgery is also much more expensive than conventional therapy.', 'However, the scientific evidence that operations do not bring an advantage in the long term compared to conventional treatment methods is low, as there are few studies of high quality.']",0,"The claim that the success of conventional treatment of a herniated disc is equivalent to that of disc surgery is supported by the fact that while surgery may provide faster pain relief, there is limited high-quality evidence to suggest it offers a long-term advantage over conventional treatment methods.","Disc surgery leads to faster pain relief in the short term, but in most cases is unlikely to bring any long-term benefit compared to conventional therapy. It is also more expensive and somewhat riskier."
Does increased time outdoors inhibit myopia in children?,"['In most of these studies [ 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11 ], various research groups discovered a connection between the extent of shortsightedness and the time spent by children and adolescents in closed spaces rather than outdoors.', 'In two studies [ 8, 9 ] there was also no connection between increased outdoor activity and reduced short-sightedness.']",0,"The claim that increased time outdoors inhibits myopia in children is partially supported by studies that found a connection between time spent in closed spaces and shortsightedness, but is also contradicted by other studies that found no such connection.","There is probably a correlation between reduced myopia and outdoor activities. However, it is not possible to say beyond doubt whether increased time spent outdoors is actually the cause of reduced myopia. Various other factors also play a role in the development of myopia."
Do household cleaners and room fresheners in spray form cause damage to the heart?,"['Risk to the heart little investigated The impact of detergents or household sprays on the cardiovascular system has so far been little investigated.', 'In particular, there was a strong correlation between abnormal heart rhythm and the use of fresh cleaning and space sprays, while the regular use of other perfumed household products was not accompanied by an unusual pattern of heartbeat.', 'Whether household sprays can directly increase the risk for cardiovascular diseases, however, cannot be derived from this with certainty.', 'Conclusion Whether household cleaners can affect heart health is not yet certain, a study that not only investigates ECG abnormalities but also the actual incidence of cardiovascular diseases after regular household cleaner use would be necessary.']",1,"The claim that household cleaners and room fresheners in spray form cause damage to the heart is uncertain because while there is a correlation between abnormal heart rhythm and the use of fresh cleaning and space sprays, it is unclear whether this correlation translates to an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases.","There is evidence that people who often use household sprays more often have asymptomatic abnormalities of the heart rhythm. However, whether these abnormalities will later lead to disease, and whether household sprays are actually the cause, remains to be determined by larger and longer studies. Many, but not all, studies also show a connection between the frequent use of cleaning agents and an increased risk of asthma - even if other causes of this respiratory disease cannot be completely ruled out."
Can stress promote dementia?,"['However, according to the Internet magazine Vorarlberg Online, stress is also the most common reason for the emergence of dementia.', 'However, studies suggest that permanent performance pressure as one of many factors could be partly responsible for the development of age dementia [1] [2] [3] [4].', 'This suggests that the subjectively perceived stress level is more decisive for the risk of dementia than the actual workload.', ""Diabetes, depression, elevated cholesterol levels and smoking are among the factors that could also favour Alzheimer's disease [6].""]",0,"The claim that stress can promote dementia is supported by the suggestion that permanent performance pressure could be partly responsible for the development of age dementia, and that subjectively perceived stress level may be a more decisive factor in the risk of dementia than actual workload.","There is evidence that chronic stress in work and private life may increase the risk of dementia in old age. However, this needs to be confirmed by larger studies. However, stress is only one of many possible influences."
Does the risk for the unborn child to develop asthma later on increase if the mother is exposed to high pollen concentrations during pregnancy?,"['However, the association with the increased pollen exposure does not exclude other causes of the increased asthma risk.', 'There is uncertainty about the cause of allergies and, subsequently, asthma.']",1,"The claim that high pollen concentrations during pregnancy increase the risk of asthma in the unborn child is uncertain due to the possibility of other causes contributing to the increased risk, and the unclear origins of allergies and asthma.",It is not clear whether a child later has an increased risk of asthma if its mother has contact with large amounts of pollen during pregnancy. Studies to date on this are rare and in some cases show methodological weaknesses.  Studies conducted according to strict criteria would be necessary to answer this question unequivocally.
Are children conceived in May more likely to be born prematurely than children conceived in other months?,"['A new study [1] sees flu as a danger for children born in May.', 'The authors see the reason for the premature birth of children born in May as the occurrence of the flu.', 'So influenza could be the trigger for premature births born in May.', 'Premature births by temperature The meta-analysis [2] suggests that the time of birth may depend on the temperature.']",0,"The claim that children conceived in May are more likely to be born prematurely is supported by the suggestion that influenza, which is linked to premature births, is a danger for children born in May, implying a possible causal relationship between the two.","There are indications that children conceived in May are born prematurely. The reason for this could be the flu, which hits May babies the hardest. The temperature can also influence the time of birth."
Do creams with sterol compounds improve the appearance of cellulite skin?,"['Since no scientific literature has been found on the issue and the study of the German testing institute has serious deficiencies, there is no evidence of the efficacy of sterol-containing anti-cellulite creams.']",1,The claim that creams with sterol compounds improve the appearance of cellulite skin lacks evidence due to the absence of scientific literature and the methodological flaws in the German testing institute's study.,There is no evidence for such an effect.

Do mindfulness-based methods effect improvement in chronic pain?,"['4 of the 7 studies (Teixeica 2010, Morone 2009, Plews-Ogan 2005 and Wong 2009) could not detect any benefit from the treatment of chronic pain with mindfulness-based methods compared to sham therapy, ordinary pain treatment or information presentations.', 'Although the results of a study (by Morone in 2008) indicated no improvement in pain perception through a mindfulness-based program, patients with chronic back pain could better accept their pain at the end of the 8-week therapy.', 'Mindfulness-based meditation and methods based on mindfulness-based stress reduction seem to be able to make pain more bearable in some cases.', 'The effectiveness of mindfulness-based therapies for the treatment of chronic pain is therefore uncertain.']",1,"The claim that mindfulness-based methods effect improvement in chronic pain is uncertain due to mixed results, with some studies showing no benefit, others indicating improved pain acceptance, and some suggesting that mindfulness-based meditation can make pain more bearable in certain cases.","Some clinical studies suggest an efficacy of mindfulness-based methods for pain management, but several other studies cannot confirm such an effect. A definitive answer could come from studies with a larger number of participants."
Do general health checkups lead to longer life?,"['Thus, general health checks do not provide a longer life.', 'The authors of the review work [1] thus attest to health checks that they miss their goal â€“ a healthier population.']",2,"The claim that general health checkups lead to a longer life is contradicted by the statement that health checks do not provide a longer life, implying that the purpose of health checks is not being achieved.",Health screenings for adults from the general population do not have the hoped-for effect: participants do not live longer as a result of serial screening and preventive care.
Can vitamin supplements protect against life-threatening diseases such as cancer or cardiovascular disease?,"['People who have no nutrient deficiency and are otherwise healthy will not benefit from the intake of vitamin preparations.', 'Possible exception Vitamin D An exception with many limitations is only vitamin D.

Taking beta-carotene and possibly vitamin E may actually increase the likelihood of premature death. The only exception is vitamin D supplements; they are likely to have a small life-prolonging effect in the elderly."
Is it true that lowering cholesterol does not reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease?,"['Study participants who consumed less salt and fat, but more fruits, vegetables and fiber, were able to lower their LDL cholesterol levels and blood pressure slightly.', 'Especially a Mediterranean diet with lots of fruits, vegetables, nuts, olive oil and fish as well as little red meat and dairy products seems to have a positive effect on heart health.', 'However, this does not mean that all cholesterol-lowering agents automatically reduce the cardiovascular risk.', 'Cholesterol only one of many heart risk factors Cholesterol is by no means the only factor that increases the likelihood of cardiovascular diseases such as heart attack or stroke.', 'Quitting smoking also significantly reduces the risk, even if it does not affect cholesterol levels.']",2,"The claim that lowering cholesterol does not reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease is supported by the sentences, which suggest that while a healthy diet can lower LDL cholesterol levels, it is only one of many heart risk factors, and other factors such as quitting smoking also play a significant role in reducing cardiovascular risk.","No. High cholesterol, along with other risk factors, can increase the likelihood of cardiovascular disease. If the proportion of ""bad"" LDL cholesterol in the blood is lowered (with medication or through a change in diet), the risk of diseases such as heart attack or stroke also decreases."

Are there medical benefits to wearing a bra?,"['No evidence that a bra changes the breast In our extensive searches, we only received one piece of work on the subject: in 1990 eleven women in Japan were examined how the consistent wearing of a strong supportive bra affects [1].', 'A change in shape of the chest by bras is thus not proven, just as no health benefits by omitting a bra.', 'Instead, we found the opposite recommendation: women who occasionally suffer from aching breasts could allegedly get relief with a well-seated bra [5-7].', 'Whether wearing a bra helps against aching breasts is scientifically unproven.', 'Also the studies, on the basis of which it is recommended to wear a well-seated bra in a painful breasts, are not meaningful: In a work already over 40 years old 114 women with a painful breast got to wear a well-suited bra, for which they could choose from 144 different sizes [2].']",1,"The claim that wearing a bra has medical benefits is unsubstantiated, as the available studies are outdated, limited, or inconclusive, and no conclusive evidence supports the idea that bras provide health benefits or alleviate aching breasts.","Whether it is healthier or even beneficial not to wear a bra cannot be answered due to a lack of studies. Conversely, a few studies claim that well-fitting bras could prevent breast pain. However, the studies are methodologically weak and have virtually no validity."
Do vein preparations for external use help with varicose veins or chronic venous insufficiency?,"['But unfortunately, there is currently no sound scientific evidence that the externally applicable means could alleviate venous ailments [1].', 'Whether varicose veins-contaminated legs help a therapy with cyanoacrylate â€“ a kind of superglue intended to seal the affected vein â€“ is currently unclear, as Medizin-transparent.at has already illuminated in its own article.', 'After most studies focused on symptoms such as itching or tension in the legs, we cannot assess whether the venous products for swallowing could slow the progression of chronic vein weakness.', 'Many questions unresolved Even if venous agents for swallowing should relieve symptoms of varicose veins and vein weakness, many questions remain open: What is the optimal dose for the respective venous agent?']",1,"The claim that vein preparations for external use help with varicose veins or chronic venous insufficiency is unsupported by scientific evidence, as current studies have not demonstrated a clear benefit in alleviating venous ailments or slowing the progression of chronic vein weakness.","At present, it is not possible to assess the efficacy of ointments, gels or creams because studies on these products are lacking. The situation is different for vein remedies to be swallowed. Studies suggest that some may improve symptoms of varicose veins or chronic venous insufficiency, such as itching, restless or swollen legs, pain and cramps. Quite likely, the remedies are likely to help with water retention in the legs (edema) caused by venous disease. However, better-done, more extensive, and longer-running studies are needed to confidently assess the efficacy of vein remedies for swallowing."
